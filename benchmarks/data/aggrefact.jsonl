The England number one appeared devastated after the final whistle at Old Trafford and acknowledged that City's bid to retain their Premier League title was over. 'That's one of my worst in a Man City shirt, definitely,' Hart said after a morale-sapping 4-2 defeat saw under-fire Manuel Pellegrini's men go four points adrift of neighbours United and 12 behind runaway leaders Chelsea. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart, pictured with Frank Lampard, was disappointed with his side's display. Hart was unable to keep out goals by United's Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling. Manchester City are four points behind rivals United . The 27-year-old has even given up on knocking Arsenal out of second place. 'It's essential to try and finish third,' he added. 'We've got to get our heads down and win these massive games.' City had looked dominant in the early stages, racing into a 1-0 lead that they could have extended before Ashley Young's equaliser triggered a derby demolition. 'Not many teams have put us to the sword like that,' Hart said. 'United know what they are doing, they took their chances. Hart, pictured saluting the travelling City fans, does not understand why his side are struggling for form. 'It's hard to take. We've won enough of them to know how to lose properly though and we weren't good enough after the first 15 minutes.' Hart added that City had let their fans down and revealed he was at a loss to explain a dramatic loss in form since the turn of the year that has seen them take 18 points from a possible 39. 'It would be easier to win games if I knew what was wrong with us but we've played well and been unfortunate in some games,' he said. 'I'm hurting from this defeat. There's a lot of emotion running through me. Let's see how it feels on Monday, we'll think about it and we'll go again.'  ."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Robert Durst is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty.", "reference_documents": ["A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in \"The Jinx,\" a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. \"At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,\" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is \"mildly autistic\" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’"], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

The 68-year-old blamed knee problems for his decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers in February. However, Redknapp told BBC Sport's Football Focus there was more to his decision than health problems. Ex-QPR boss Harry Redknapp has described the club as 'like a bit of a soap opera' after quitting in February. Striker Charlie Austin celebrates after scoring in QPR's 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday night. He said: 'I always thought I had everyone pulling with me and suddenly I felt some were and some weren't. I didn't know who was on my side at the end and who wasn't. 'Behind the scenes, I always thought there were one or two people with their own agendas. 'There was always talk about Tim Sherwood coming in. It was like a bit of a soap opera.

You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. ‘Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals.

Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: \"It was a joke, and no offense was meant.\" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: \"We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real.\" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised \"money back if he walks\" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius.

Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved .

Speaking during an engagement in London last month, she said that her second child is due 'mid to late April'. Scroll down for video . Due today? The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due 'mid to late April' during a visit last month. Kate, 33, who was touring the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford with Prince William, added: 'Not long to go now.' Although April 25 is widely thought to be the Duchess' due date, royal sources point out that it has never been officially confirmed as such. 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date,' a Kensington Palace source told MailOnline. 'The Duchess herself said mid to late April and there have been plenty of dates bandied around in the media but we've never confirmed anything and we never will.' However, the 25th remains a favourite with punters according to bookmakers Ladbrokes, although tomorrow and Friday are also popular and are priced at just 6/1. The Duchess is currently thought to be staying at Kensington Palace, a short drive from the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital where she is due to give birth. Popular: The 25th is the favourite but the Palace says neither that date or any other has been confirmed. Preparations: The police were seen making final checks ahead of the birth outside the Lindo Wing yesterday. Yesterday, police could be seen searching the area in preparation for the Duchess' arrival and were seen peering under traffic cones and taking lamp posts apart. According to a statement released by Kensington Palace the same day, the new baby's father, Prince William, has  finished his Air Ambulance training early and will now avoid the two-hour dash from Norfolk that some had predicted. 'The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated,' the statement read. 'This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned. 'As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.' Fans: Royal fans have also set up camp outside the hospital, among them Terry Hut, 71. Ready to go: The scenes outside the hospital are reminiscent of those seen for Prince George in 2013. Back in town: The Palace has said Prince Harry will be in London this weekend before returning to Australia. But concerns have been raised about the possibility of the royal birth clashing with official events to mark the centenary of the Dardanelles campaign, with Prince William due to attend a wreath-laying service at the Cenotaph on Saturday. The ceremony, which is also being held to mark ANZAC Day, will be mirrored by another taking place in Turkey which is due to be attended by the Prince of Wales and Prince Harry. Kensington Palace have also said that rather than return directly to Australia, where he is currently taking part in training exercises with the Australian Defence Force, Harry will briefly travel back to London instead. Harry will attend Sunday's London Marathon, which, according to Palace sources, is a long-standing commitment but one that could  be confirmed only after  his Australian army schedule had been firmed up. .  ."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

A teacher who fled the U.S. with his stepdaughter and her mother ten years ago has finally given himself up in Costa Rica. Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, gave surrendered at the U.S. embassy on Monday and were flown back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, where Kelley was arrested. The pair fled New Hampshire in 2004 along with Genevieve Kelley, Mary's mother, during a custody dispute with Mark Nunes, Genevieve's former husband and Mary's father. Genevieve, now 50, handed herself in last November, but refused to give up the location of her husband and daughter, who had not been seen for a decade until this week. Speaking to People magazine, Scott Kelley said: 'It was time to come home.' He is now facing a charge of custodial interference, the same charge his wife is due to face in court next month. Kelley's case dates back to December 2004 when Mark Nunes, a physician, was granted custody of daughter Mary, then eight, to take her for treatment for an unspecified illness. However, Genevieve, also a physician, refused to hand the girl over, instead taking her to Colorado for a second opinion, where a doctor diagnosed her with acute post traumatic stress disorder. While in Colorado, Genevieve alleged that Mr Nunes had sexually abused the girl, and then fled to South America along with current husband Scott. The state Division of Children, Youth and Families investigated and said any claims of abuse were 'unfounded,' and instead concluded that Genevieve instead likely abused the girl. Charges were never brought, however, because by that point the Kelleys, along with Mary Nunes, had already vanished. Mary Nunes, disappeared when she was aged 8 (left), and is now aged 19 (digitally aged version, right). The Kelleys fled after Mark Nunes, Mary's biological father, was granted custody of his daughter in 2004. Genevieve (pictured) refused to hand her daughter over to Mr Nunes, and took the girl first to Colorado, then boarded a flight to South America and was not seen again for a decade. Despite well-publicized searches of the U.S., Canada, and South America, and dozens of other appeals, there was no sign of the family until February last year. Shortly after Mary turned 18, and was therefore no longer subject to the family court, Genevieve made contact with the authorities, but refused to come forward. Then, on  Monday, November 13, she finally appeared, saying she needed medical treatment for a son she gave birth to with Scott while she was in hiding. But despite pressure from officials, and pleas from her former husband, she refused to reveal the location of Mary, or husband Scott, saying only that the girl was safe. Then, on Monday, officials were alerted that Scott and Mary had come forward after the pair went to the U.S. Department of State office in Costa Rica to get travel documents to return home. Deputy Marshal Jamie Berry, New Hampshire case manager for the Kelley case, said marshals were alerted to the family's travel arrangements, and stopped them as they landed. Genevieve, now aged 50, was arrested by authorities in November last year after she came forward asking for medical treatment for a son that she gave birth to while in hiding. Scott and Mary were taken into custody at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (pictured) on Monday. Mary is now living at an undisclosed location in the U.S., while Scott is in police custody. Mr Berry said: 'Investigators talked to her and made sure she was OK. We asked if she wanted any other arrangements, and she said no. We wanted to make sure she was there of her own free will. . 'It's been a long ten years. We had a lot of lookalikes we had investigated. We followed a lot of false leads, but we had to follow them all. Mary's safe, and that was the overall goal for us.' Mary has been released from custody and is now staying at an undisclosed location in the U.S., officials said. It was confirmed that she plans to testify at her mother's trial, which is due to begin next month. . Genevieve Kelley had previously argued that her daughter should be allowed to testify by video, but a judge turned this request down, saying she needed to be questioned by prosecutors. Scott Kelley was jailed in Atlanta and couldn't be reached for comment. If he doesn't agree to return to New Hampshire, Berry said, extraditions proceedings will begin. ."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \" guerilla satirist \" The New York Times dubbed him the \" Che Guevara of advertising \" \" Weird Al \" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career.", "reference_documents": ["(The Hollywood Reporter)Stan Freberg, whose freewheeling comic career in advertising garnered him worldwide acclaim and whose satirical entertainments abounded on TV, the radio and on records, has died. He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" — on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May — lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return. He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story. Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear.

The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost £12,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The £88,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow.

The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal.

In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009.

It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United.

Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. .

Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011.

Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. .

This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago. Veteran fly half Charlie Hodgson will run the show for Saracens against Clermont on Saturday . England centre Brad Barritt will captain Mark McCall's side against at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Owen Farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash . CLERMONT AUVERGNE: N Abendanon; N Nakaitaci, J Davies, W Fofana, N Nalaga; B James, L Radosavljevic; V Debaty, B Kayser, D Zirakashvili, J Cudmore, S Vahaamahina, J Bonnaire, D Chouly (capt), J Bardy. SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. . TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final. Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt — captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19. 'He took them on a journey over four seasons where they won the all-Ireland in year two and have been Ulster champions in three out of the four years he coached them. It seemed like a very similar journey to our own. Our players were captivated.' Jacques Burger (centre) was a standout performer in Saracens' 46-6 victory at Twickenham last season . Saracens are able to call on linchpin No 8 Billy Vunipola, who starts in a back row alongside Burger and Itoje who, standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb, epitomises the modern-day rugby player. Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester's Mathew Tait in last weekend's Premiership encounter. . With veteran fly-half Charlie Hodgson in the form of his life and Owen Farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of England's Six Nations campaign, Saracens are close to full strength. Barritt believes experience will be crucial. 'We have a squad who have been there and done it,' he said. 'We have experienced those highs and lows of winning a Premiership, losing in the final of the Premiership and consistently getting to the latter stages of the Europe. Those experiences made us a stronger and better team. McCall (above) invited  ex-Donegal gaelic football manager Jim McGuinness to speak to his side this week . 'We feel like we're in a great position for the final run-in of the season. We've won the last six or seven games. In these big games it's often about adapting to the situation and we know we have got a few strings to our bow.' Against a Clermont side capable of striking from anywhere on the field, Saracens will need all those strings.

Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his ‘manifestly ill-founded’ case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. . This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the £40,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: ‘This is a shocking example of Labour’s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.’. Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. . He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius’s claim that extradition breached his human rights was ‘inadmissible’. They added: ‘The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.’ ."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates. Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season. 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. . And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations.  . 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. . Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres. Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time. But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again. 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. .

Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it."], "label": "NS", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

Obeiallah: Individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals.", "reference_documents": ["According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place.

Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters.

Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things — and I’m not talking about this instance — (but) how it gets framed is totally different.’ Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign.

Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian.

Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future.

Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October.

Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny. West Brom's players wore multicoloured boots on' Jeff Astle day' Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has scored 16 goals in 16 games.", "reference_documents": ["Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. . 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him – but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur’s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal. Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run. Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea’s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas’ late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances – as many as the rest of Chelsea’s back four put together – and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger’s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal’s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over – one more than they’d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany’s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January – a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them – a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom’s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion’s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football’s black and white days – every one of Albion’s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow – and captain Darren Fletcher’s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns. 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It’s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total – Christian Benteke’s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park. 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman’s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn’t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue – Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals’ youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months – just in time to be available for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke’s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon. 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One – it’s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe’s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who’ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani – and he’s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places.

Origi added that the challenges he has faced at Lille this season will make him a better player for Liverpool.

But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy.

Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? . Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. . Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend. And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight. The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit. King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy. The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. . Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. . 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' .

Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013. A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one.  . 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' . Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. . Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. . Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. . What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. . 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! . 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.  ."], "label": "NS", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army.

The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from a telephone listing for the soccer league. Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. . He expressed remorse in court and said he prays for the Bieniewicz family. The lawsuit also names the Michigan United Soccer League, which is accused of allowing Saad to play despite his reputation as a violent player. Citing his doctor, the lawsuit described Bieniewicz, who had two children, as being in great health with the potential to live to age 95. Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad.

Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014. .  ."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

Watford can be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth or Middlesbrough lose and Norwich fail to win Rotherham's desire to stave off relegation to League One has been made more difficult by a points deduction Steve McClaren will be desperate to manage in the Premier League again; Derby can secure a play-off spot Championship Watford (away to Brighton) will be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth (home to Bolton, Monday) or Middlesbrough (away to Fulham) lose and Norwich (away to Rotherham) fail to win. Derby (away to Millwall) will make sure of a play-off place if they win. Ipswich (home to Nottingham Forest) will make sure of a play-off place if they win and both Brentford (away to Reading) and Wolves (away to Wigan) fail to win. The situation at the bottom is complicated by Rotherham's three-point deduction for fielding an ineligible player. If Rotherham win, Wigan will be relegated if they fail to win. If Rotherham win, Millwall will be relegated if they lose. League One Preston (home to Swindon) will be promoted if they win and MK Dons (away to Rochdale) lose. Sheffield United (away to Leyton Orient) and Chesterfield (home to Bristol City) will be guaranteed play-off places with wins or if Rochdale fail to win. Leyton Orient (home to Sheff Utd) and Notts County (home to Doncaster) will be relegated if they lose and Crewe (away to Coventry) win and Crawley (away to Peterborough) avoid defeat. Colchester (away to Fleetwood) will be relegated if they lose and Crewe and Crawley win and Port Vale (away to Yeovil) avoid defeat. Jermaine Beckford (left) and Daniel Johnson celebrate; Preston can be promoted if they win and MK Dons lose Burton Albion have already been promoted but they can secure champion status this weekend League Two Already-promoted Burton (home to Northampton) will be champions if they win and Shrewsbury (away to Cheltenham) fail to win. Shrewsbury will be promoted if they win or if one of Wycombe (home to Morecambe) or Southend (home to Luton) fails to win. Stevenage (home to Carlisle) will guarantee a play-off place if they win or if one of Plymouth (home to Tranmere) or Luton fails to win. Tranmere will be relegated if they lose and if one of Hartlepool (home to Exeter) or Cheltenham win. Tranmere will also be relegated if they fail to win and Hartlepool win. Cheltenham will be relegated if they lose and Hartlepool win. ........................................................................... Conference Barnet (home to Gateshead) will be promoted as champions if they win. Bristol Rovers (home to Alfreton) will be promoted as champions if they win and Barnet fail to win. Eastleigh (home to Kidderminster) and Forest Green (home to Dover) will guarantee play-off places if they win or if Macclesfield (away to Torquay) fail to win. Macclesfield need to win and hope either Eastleigh lose or Forest Green fail to win. Barring a 14-goal swing, Alfreton will be relegated if they lose. Welling (home to Southport) will be relegated if they lose and Alfreton draw or if they draw and Alfreton win. Southport will be relegated if they lose and Alfreton win by reversing an eight-goal goal-difference deficit.

All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home."], "label": "NS", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": ""}

Speaking in the latest issue of Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former senator and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet: Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose ideology revolves around getting 're-elected at all costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female politicians get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There’s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let’s do something about that,' she said. 'Let’s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that’s OK, and if it does look good, that’s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld.

The US  were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta, meaning they were relegated to World Group II.

Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves . Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1's power proved to be too much . 'Today has been a big eye opener,' Williams said afterwards. 'I'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was. Now I'm in the mindset of, \"You know what, I'm not on hard court.\" I'm playing like I'm on hard court and I'm not.

The French Open has been her least successful of the four though despite claiming the title in Paris in 2002 and 2013. Her doubles defeat on Sunday blotted an otherwise flawless Fed Cup record and left the US facing a battle to get back amongst the elite nations next year. 'We have to work harder,' US captain Mary Joe Fernandez said. 'We came close today and need to just keep plugging away.

The singer said she was not angry with Gray and claimed \"the system has failed him\", a view echoed by his mother. The 30-year-old started pursuing the star by sending abusive rants and accusations in letters. He progressed to banging on her door and spending nights in her back garden. Gray was eventually charged by police after an incident last October when the singer was awoken by him bursting into her bedroom in the early hours. Allen said she was made to feel like a \"nuisance rather than a victim\" by police, adding that the experience had left her \"a changed person\". Gray's mother Michelle said she had tried to get help for her son from the authorities for years. Speaking on the Good Morning Britain programme, she said: \"I had no idea that he had been stalking Lily Allen and putting her through these years of torture. \"We knew he had a fixation with her but not that he had actually been anywhere near her. \"We just thought he had a fantasy in his head.\" What's the difference between a super-fan and a stalker?

I could see he was really agitated and upset,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight. Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.  It was the culmination of an ordeal that started back in 2008 when Gray first contacted Allen on Twitter.

She added: \"We knew he had a mental disorder and he had been diagnosed with paranoid delusional schizophrenia two years ago and he was meant to be on medication for this, but nobody was ensuring that that was happening. \"It escalated after his dad died. He got worse and we knew he was getting worse. We tried to get him help and nobody would help us at all.\" His sister Kaylie Gray said: \"I don't think it's going to be good for either party - for Alex, for us, for her (Allen) - if he just goes to prison because he's not going to get any help. \"He's just going to continue to get worse and then he's going to get released without any help and we are just back to square one again.\" Asked if Gray had shown any remorse, his sister replied: \"No, Alex is a very closed book. \"He doesn't like to talk about anything and because of his disorder he thinks people are tapping phones, so he won't talk to me about things like that over the phone.\" His mother added: \"He finds it hard to... separate what's real and what's not real, it's part of his illness, I think.\" Kaylie Gray said the family has not had any contact with Lily Allen.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Harry Pincher, who has died at the age of 100, was one of Britain's best-known and most influential journalists.", "reference_documents": ["As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops. One of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note. After his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level. Harry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914. He went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated  in zoology and botany. Ironically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause. \"I said to one: 'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?' \"He said: 'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.' \"So I said: 'Well, bugger that.'\" Pincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943. After the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor. One of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme. He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it. \"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\" But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle. His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things. His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.) \"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said. \"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know. \"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\" Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting. \"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his.\" In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's Â£5 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than Â£4 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability. After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service. \"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963. \"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\" One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret\", to his minister of defence. \"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher? \"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\" And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967. What became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations. He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed. \"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said. \"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\""], "label": "NS", "category": "AggreFact-XSum", "additional_info": ""}

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,\" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

Campaigners say approval would set a \"dangerous precedent\". But the company says its operations are no risk to people or the environment. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into rocks deep underground to unlock trapped gas. The process was banned in 2011 after the shale gas firm Cuadrilla caused minor earth tremors when it fracked a well in Lancashire. Third Energy has licences to produce gas in North Yorkshire and offshore in the North Sea. In 2013 it drilled an exploratory well near the village of Kirby Misperton, close to the North York Moors National Park. It now wants to frack the well to test whether it can unlock shale gas from rocks up to 10,000ft (3,000m) underground. \"All we want to do is test whether gas will flow from an existing well using hydraulic fracturing,\" says Rasik Valand, chief executive of Third Energy. \"What we are planning is safe. There is no risk to the environment or the public.\" But there has been strong opposition to the plan from the local community and environmentalists. Hundreds of anti-fracking protesters are expected to gather outside the council meeting in Northallerton on Friday. The council has received more than 4,000 representations, the vast majority against the proposal. Green campaigners fear that approval here would open the door for fracking elsewhere. \"It risks setting a dangerous precedent for Britain,\" says Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth. \"We strongly urge councillors to reject this planning application which is clearly deeply unpopular with the local community.\" Others are concerned about the impact on the local economy as Kirby Misperton is also home to Flamingo Land, one of Yorkshire's top tourists attractions. \"This place is beautiful,\" says retired bishop, the Right Reverend Graham Cray, who lives in the village. \"The economy is based on tourism and agriculture. Tourists don't come to a gas field and that is what we will turn into if we get the scale of fracking that is intended.\" Last year Lancashire County Council rejected Cuadrilla's plan to carry out exploratory drilling and fracking at two new sites on the Fylde. A planning inquiry into that application took place earlier this year. A recommendation will be sent in the summer to the communities secretary for a final decision. The Third Energy application involves an existing site that has produced gas since the 1990s. The well has already been drilled. The shale gas produced will also be sent through a network of pipes to a nearby power station. That will avoid air pollution caused by flaring gas. So the company expects the fracking activity to be completed within eight weeks. The council's planning officer has recommended that the application be approved. But it is now down to the 11 councillors on the planning committee to take the final decision. That decision may not come until Monday due to the number of people who have registered to speak at the meeting. If approved, fracking could start by the end of the year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change refused to comment on Third Energy's application ahead of the council meeting. But in a statement it said: \"Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity which will create jobs, boost our economy and strengthen our energy security. \"There is tough regulation in place to ensure that fracking can take place safely - now is the time to start exploration and find out just how much shale gas is there and how much we can get out of the ground.\" You can follow John on Twitter at @JohnMoylanBBC."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-XSum", "additional_info": ""}

We seek to put our fingers on the pulse of the ebbs and flows of coverage of climate change over time, month to month. \"It's not an exhaustive reading of all media accounts everywhere around the globe across all platforms, but rather is a way to get us talking productively. \"In 2004 there were relatively low levels of coverage. Around 2006, into 2007 there was an uptick. There was a high water mark in 2009 [at the time of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]. \"From that high water mark to 2014, coverage has dropped: 36% globally; 26% in the US; and as much as 55% in the UK. \"Within the last year here in the United States, National Public Radio reduced its environment reporting team from three to one reporter. \"We see examples of this unfolding quite regularly. There's certainly newsroom pressures. There's shrinking time to deadline, there's reduced resources to cover complex issues such as climate change that require a certain level of investigation, a certain level of familiarity with the contours and the nuances of the topics.\" Jennifer Morgan is the Global Director of the climate change programme at the World Resources Institute. \"Copenhagen was supposed to be the moment when over 190 countries came together and agreed a new legally binding agreement to address climate change. It was very much a great excitement and anticipation of trying to finally get a global agreement after the Kyoto years. \"I remember walking in with a colleague of mine, and saying 'Okay, we have to do it.  We have to get this done, these moments don't happen very often'. \"But it soon became clear that negotiations weren't going to plan:. \"In the middle of the second week normally what happens is the options start to get narrowed down, and you can see the package emerging. That wasn't happening, and that's when we all started to get very concerned.\" China's chief negotiator was barred by security for the first few days, sessions were routinely suspended in the name of finishing on time, developing countries said they were ignored, and the EU was missing from a final meeting where a last-minute, non-binding deal was drawn up. \"It was terrible. [We felt] an exhausted defeat, just a deep fatigue, particularly from the European side, of just wanting to take a break. The personal sacrifice - it sounds crazy - but believing and trying to make something happen, I think it was a trauma, just to put so much blood, sweat and tears into it. \"Right after Copenhagen, there was a sense that there needed to be a bit of a time out on the world leaders' side of things. So it definitely went into a very low level of attention for a few years. The relationships of some of the Heads of State after Copenhagen were quite strained. \"Even months after, it was almost like [they] had been being psychologically burned by this. \"That's had a real impact on the willingness of these individuals to stay engaged.\" Environmental psychologist Robert Gifford researches why even those who accept a link between human behaviour and climate change are reluctant to act. \"Our brain physically hasn't developed much for about 30,000 years. At that time we were mostly wandering around on the Savannah, and our main concerns were very immediate: feeding ourselves right now, worrying about anybody who might try to take our territory. There was very little thinking about what might happen in five years, 10 years, or 100km away. \"We still have this same brain. Obviously we're capable of planning, but the kind of default is to stick into the here and now, which is not very good for thinking about climate change, which is a problem that, for many people, is more in the future and farther away, or at least we think it is. \"[And] as any advertiser knows, if you don't change your message people will just tune out. And so environmental numbness is 'yes, I've heard that message before'. We're always open to new messages, and paying more attention to new messages. So if governments or policymakers repeat the same message too often, people just tune out after a while.\" We also tend to tune out when we feel helpless:.

I'm just one person, and there's 7+ billion people on the planet. I just don't have much control over this, so therefore I'm not going to do much about it, because my contribution, even if I did everything, wouldn't make much difference.' \"Most of us who are trying to do something about this have realised, for example, that the polar bear metaphor is not a great one. Yes, we have some sympathy for this poor polar bear, but it's not close enough to our own lives. \"Uncertainty is a really big problem. We've learned in my own laboratory from experimental evidence that when people feel a bit uncertain about an environmental problem - if the future temperature might vary from a half a degree increase to a one and a half degrees increase - people will say 'well, it's probably only going to be a half a degree increase, so I'll keep flying to some tropical place'. \"It's a natural human tendency to interpret information in a way that suits our personal interests. Joe Smith teaches geography at the Open University and argues the narrative around climate science must evolve. \"I'm not sure that people need to engage with climate change at all. It's more or less unreportable if you just describe it on the page.  It's complex, interdisciplinary, the findings drip out over time, and the boundary between science and policy and politics is a very messy one. It's a real challenge for the media. \"The idea that we will mobilise any more people with fear messaging is wrong.  I think we've knocked at the door of everyone that might respond to such a thing, but you've also got to ask whether it's an accurate way of telling the science.  I think it is more respectful to the nature of the science to say that it's one of humanity's most ambitious questions. \"There was a tactical wrong turning in suggesting that by insisting that the debate is over, we can move onto the action. It somehow implied that the science was complete, and that, of course, left lots of space for those people who have arguments about the actions on climate change to stand in the way of us having a proper public conversation about those actions because they were able to pick apart minor details in the science. \"It's not just that climate science isn't finished, it's actually unfinishable. \"The rest of science - particle physics, cosmology - is allowed to be rather saucy. I would love to get to the point where we allow climate change science to simply be interesting, enchanting even, as fascinating as any area of science because it's a hugely ambitious and compelling mission. \"If you want to talk to a business person, you talk about energy security for their business or energy security for their nation.  If you want to talk to a parent at the school gate, you talk to them about the health of their child, their experience of the trip to school - wouldn't they be happier walking and cycling? \"Talking about climate change doesn't have to involve 'talking about climate change' to lead us to some really substantial actions. \"We don't need to wear a climate change t-shirt.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT.

And the Perth club's chairman, Steve Brown, has spoken of his surprise that no other club has come in for Wright. \"I think he's worried about me coming into the last two years of my contract, that he's not going to get any compensation for me and that would panic him a bit,\" joked Wright, 53. \"I'm happy here. It is nice that you are linked with other jobs and so-called bigger clubs because that really means people realise the job you're doing here. \"That's the most important thing for me. I'm looking forward to this season, playing in Europe and doing well for St Johnstone.\" As it turned out, Pedro Caixinha took over from Mark Warburton at Ibrox and Derek McInnes has chosen to remain at Pittodrie, despite having discussions about the Sunderland vacancy, leaving Wright in charge at McDiarmid Park. In his four years at St Johnstone, and on a modest budget, he has guided them to the Scottish Cup, in 2014, and secured top-six finishes every season in the Premiership. Asked if he was surprised that his record had not led to approaches from other clubs, Wright told BBC Scotland: \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't, but it's not something that keeps me awake at night. \"It's not something that, if I see someone else getting a job, puts me in a bad mood. It's just the way it is and all I can do is keep doing my job here. \"I'm quite happy for the chairman to come and extend my contract at St Johnstone if he wants, but by the look of his comments he'd rather sell me and get a few quid in. \"I just have a simple way of looking at things - do the job to the best of your ability, do it well and whatever will happen will happen.\" Wright has been preparing his squad at Inverclyde Sports Centre in Largs for another crack at the Europa League, their reward for finishing fourth last term. Having lost Danny Swanson to newly promoted Hibernian and now defender Tam Scobbie to Scottish Championship club Dundee United, Wright is looking to strengthen his squad. He's in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and it comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem. \"There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and that certainly leaves us short in terms of a left-back,\" said the Northern Irishman. \"I wanted Thomas {Scobbie} re-signed. I know he was more than happy to stay, but something's happened that it's fallen through so I've got to deal with that. \"It's part of management, you don't always get what you want and now we've got to move on and do the best for the club. I'm now putting all my efforts in to get a left-back to be cover for losing Thomas.\" Wright drew praise for his handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team-mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half-time in the match with Hamilton. But the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of his managerial career. \"I didn't see it and still haven't seen it because there's no footage of it, which is a miracle these days,\" he said. \"Immediately after the game, when I'm hearing what's allegedly happened, there was one thought in my head: that the two of them can go, they're out, they're sacked. \"But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and myself. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting they were wrong, they were remorseful. \"So come the Saturday night they definitely weren't going to be sacked, but the chairman and I felt that for the image of the club we'd deal with this as severely and as quickly as we could (with a fine and reprimand). \"We were honest with the players, in terms of how we felt they had let not only themselves down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole. \"The timing of it could have derailed our season. We actually lost the game 1-0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and that was gut-wrenching for the players.\" Wright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints' next two games, it showed the benefit of  \"having good people and a good squad\".

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has said he is considering seeking political asylum in the UK because he is considered a \"threat\" to President Vladimir Putin.", "reference_documents": ["He was speaking in a BBC interview after a Russian court declared him \"under arrest in absentia\" over the 1990s murder of a Siberian mayor. \"Definitely I'm considering asking for asylum in the UK,\" he said. Mr Putin \"sees me - it's obvious now - as a serious threat\", he said. Once Russia's richest man, the former head of the now defunct Yukos oil firm spent 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which he says were politically motivated. Mr Putin pardoned him in 2013 and he now lives abroad, mainly in Switzerland. \"I'm considered by President Putin as a threat, economically, because of the possible seizure of Russian assets abroad, and politically, as someone who will potentially help democratic candidates in the coming 2016 elections,\" he said. Russia will hold elections to the lower house of parliament - the State Duma - next year. The Duma is currently dominated by Mr Putin's supporters. The BBC's Richard Galpin asked Mr Khodorkovsky whether he felt at risk in light of the murders of prominent opponents of Mr Putin in recent years. Among them was former secret agent Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with radioactive polonium in a London hotel in 2006. \"The history of deaths of opponents of this regime is impressive... but I was in jail for 10 years, I could have been killed any day easily. In London I feel much safer than during those years,\" he replied. When he left Russia in 2013 he said he would not get involved in politics - which was widely believed to have been the reason for his early release. He told the BBC on Wednesday that he would \"help young political activists in Russia to gain political experience and present an alternative to the existing regime\". He said it was \"far too optimistic\" to speak of regime change in Russia now, \"but I'm quite confident that within 10 years the regime will be changed and I hope I will play a significant role in that\". Earlier, referring to the Russian order for his arrest, he said the Moscow authorities had \"gone mad\". He is accused of ordering several of his employees to kill both the mayor and a businessman, who survived. Investigators allege Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, was killed on 26 June 1998 for demanding Mr Khodorkovsky's oil firm, Yukos, pay taxes that the company had allegedly been avoiding. Local businessman Yevgeny Rybin was allegedly targeted because his activities \"clashed with Yukos's interests\", Russia's powerful Investigative Committee (SK) said in a statement (in Russian). Mr Rybin survived a gun attack in November 1998 and a second attack on his car in March 1999, when another man in the vehicle was killed and several people were injured. Five people have already been tried for the attacks and the arrest warrant is unlikely to make any difference unless Mr Khodorkovsky returns to Russia, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. Armed police raided the Moscow offices of Mr Khodorkovsky's Open Russia pro-democracy movement on Tuesday, in a move that authorities said was linked to allegations of tax evasion. The flats of at least seven activists who work for Mr Khodorkovsky were also searched. After Mr Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, Yukos was broken up and taken over by a state oil firm. Last year an international arbitration court in The Hague said Russian officials had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt Yukos, and jail Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The court told Russia to pay former shareholders in Yukos $50bn (Â£32bn) in compensation. 1963 - Born in Moscow, son of chemical engineers. 1987 - Founds Menatep bank. 1995 - Buys Yukos for $350m, with Menatep assuming $2bn in debt. 2003 - Arrested for tax evasion, embezzlement and fraud. 2005 - Found guilty on six of seven charges, jailed for eight years. 2007 - Yukos declared bankrupt. 2010 - Convicted of embezzlement and money laundering. 2013 - Pardoned by President Putin after request for clemency; leaves Russia for Germany. 2015 - Charged with ordering 1990s murder of Siberian mayor; says he is considering asking for political asylum in the UK."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-XSum", "additional_info": ""}

Al-Rai's capture after several days of heavy fighting secures an important supply line from Turkey for the rebels. Separately, at least 200 people are missing after an IS attack on a factory near Damascus, the government says. Workers were reportedly taken from a dormitory where they were staying on the outskirts of the town of Dumeir, about 40km (25 miles) east of the capital. Activists from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say about 140 workers managed to escape. Initially there was confusion over who attacked the factory, with some sources suggesting the abductions were carried out by a rebel group called Jaysh Tahrir al-Sham. A factory administrator said no-one had been able to contact the workers since the assault on Monday. The area around Dumeir has seen fierce fighting between government forces and IS militants in recent days. The BBC's Lina Sinjab in Lebanon says that al-Rai is a crucial stronghold for IS as it sits on a crossing linking Turkey to Syria. The Observatory said that an alliance of \"rebel factions and Islamists\" had captured the town. Control of al-Rai allows opposition fighters to lay siege to positions held by IS to the north of Aleppo and cut the group's supply lines, a commander of the opposition al-Mutasim Brigade was quoted as telling local media. Al-Rai can now be be used by opposition groups as a launching pad for future operations against IS in the east and south, the commander, Mohamed Hassan Khalil, added. He said that the main dangers faced by the opposition groups fighting IS were improvised mines, booby-trapped vehicles and suicide bombers. Earlier this week IS jihadists said they had launched several attacks around north-east Damascus, including Tishrin power station and Dumeir military airport. A Syrian military source told Reuters there had been attacks but all of the militants who took part in them had been killed.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The BBC is to create a new Ideas Service to bring the \"best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers\" to everyone, as part of a major overhaul of the corporation.", "reference_documents": ["These are external links and will open in a new window. BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an \"open BBC for the internet age\". A children's iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned. Yet he said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services. Lord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016. Citing the importance of \"excellence without arrogance\", he said his plans did not signal \"an expansionist BBC\". He did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean it would \"inevitably have to either close or reduce some services\", without specifying which areas might be under threat. New initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an \"open online platform\" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation itself. He said: \"Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone. \"Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world. We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world. \"We are extremely ambitious for this new service. \"Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world.\" The government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask \"hard questions\" about the corporation's size and ambition. Other BBC plans include:. The director general also said he wanted to enable \"producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere\". Quality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make \"bigger and bolder series\" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety. Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution. \"This is not an expansionist BBC\" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements.  This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is \"imperial in its ambitions\" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers). Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition. The second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to \"binge\" watch. The BBC is in a global marketplace - Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple and HBO - the traditional media landscape is being blown apart. The BBC's problem is looking after its core audience and responding to a technological transformation.  It will take money and the BBC has just taken a Â£650m cut.  Those \"tough choices\" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced. Lord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the Â£600m cost of providing free television licences for over-75s as a \"tough deal\" that would require \"some very difficult choices\" to be made. He said: \"Having already saved 40% of the BBC's revenues in this charter period, we must save close to another 20% over the next five years.\" Details of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, he added. In a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that \"some existing services\" might no longer be needed in future. \"Streaming news may replace rolling news,\" the document states. \"Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television. The Ideas Service might mean we no longer need BBC Four.\" Later in the same document, though, the BBC states \"it is too early to be specific about the service changes that we will need to make.\" The BBC's plans for \"a network of 100 public service reporters across the country\" did not find favour with the Scottish Newspaper Society, who labelled the proposal \"a Trojan horse which will undermine long-established publications and destroy local news agencies\". \"Instead of helping local news publishers, it would make the BBC even more powerful and would further concentrate coverage of news in the hands of the state-funded broadcaster,\" said its director John McLellan. The News Media Association, which represents national, regional and local news media organisations across the UK, expressed similar concerns, saying the corporation's proposals represented \"BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door\". \"The local newspaper sector already employs thousands of journalists and is the only reliable source of independent and trusted local news across the UK,\" said its vice chairman Ashley Highfield. \"There is no deficit which the BBC needs to plug.\" \"Under the guise of being helpful, the BBC would end up replacing independent local news services,\" Mr McLellan told Radio 4's The World at One earlier, calling the plan \"a further expansion of the BBC's encroachment\". Yet this accusation was rejected by James Purnell, the BBC's director of strategy, who told the same programme it was \"very much not the goal\" for the BBC to \"take over all local journalism\"."], "label": "S", "category": "AggreFact-XSum", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov, one of the world's longest-serving strongmen, has died at the age of 90.", "reference_documents": ["These are external links and will open in a new window. The Uzbek government announced his death on Friday after a period of rumours about his ill health. As is often the case with strongman regimes, no tried and tested succession mechanism is in place in Uzbekistan, and the transition of power may well be a complicated process. Uzbekistan is the most populous Central Asian country and has the largest army. Mr Karimov, who came to power during the Soviet era, has led the country since independence in 1991. During his long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism. But many believe this has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition. It also has not completely eradicated the long-term risk posed by Islamist militancy. Many Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, they might be tempted to come back. Some also say that Uzbekistan's fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost its appeal in the majority Muslim country. Positioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history. Most recently, it has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold. In 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use its air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington's criticism of the Uzbek government's human rights record. Moscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov's successor leans towards Russia rather than the West. So far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Political instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders. The country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets. Tension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Regional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China. Uzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts. President Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. This, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country. Should it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing. President Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002.

Meanwhile, the Nottingham Forest Supporters' Trust have been given an assurance by the city council that the land on which the City Ground is built will never be sold. The stadium is owned by the club, but the land still belongs to the council. The Supporters' Trust have also applied to register the City Ground as an Asset of Community Value, meaning they would have first refusal to purchase the stadium if it were ever to be sold, with six months to raise the required funds. \"This is a key safeguarding measure for the future of our football club,\" a spokesperson said. \"With our membership now live and having already seen hundreds of members join up, we have a huge wealth of skills to call upon to continue to push further initiatives forward.\""], "label": "NS", "category": "AggreFact-XSum", "additional_info": ""}

Mulbah broke the deadlock in a goalmouth scramble on 58 minutes and completed the rout after Sarkoh punished a blunder from Algeria goalkeeper Malek Asselah. The unexpectedly heavy loss for Kabylie was another blow to Algerian football, after the Desert Foxes were eliminated from the recent Africa Cup of Nations at the group phase.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The decision in New Jersey v. T.L.O. was made on January 15, 1985.", "reference_documents": ["Facts and case summary for New Jersey v. T.L.O. (1985).\nT.L.O. was a 14-year-old female student at a New Jersey high school. A teacher found T.L.O. and another student smoking cigarettes in the girls’ restroom in the school building in violation of school rules. The teacher brought the two students to a school administrator, who questioned each of them. The second student admitted to smoking cigarettes. T.L.O. denied the allegations. The administrator then accused T.LO. of lying to him, and demanded to see her purse in an attempt to find the cigarettes. Among other things, when the administrator opened her purse, he found a pack of cigarettes, and cigarette rolling paper. Due to the fact that the administrator knew that cigarette rolling paper is used to smoke marijuana he now suspected T.L.O. of marijuana use. He further searched T.L.O.’s purse, and found a small plastic bag containing a grass-like substance and items that could be drug paraphernalia, including a pipe, a wad of money, a piece of paper with the names of students who apparently owed T.L.O. money, and a letter that appeared to implicate T.L.O. in dealing marijuana. The administrator contacted the police who, in turn, contacted T.L.O.’s mother. Her mother brought T.L.O. to the police station, where she confessed to selling marijuana.\nDue to her age, T.L.O. faced delinquency charges in Juvenile Court. The Juvenile Court denied T.L.O.’s motion to suppress (keep out) her confession and the evidence from the search. Her lawyer argued that the search of her purse was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. T.L.O. was found delinquent, and was put on probation for one year. After a lengthy appeal process in the New Jersey state court system, the U.S. Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear the case.\n“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\nLower Court 1 : Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Middlesex County, N.J.\nLower Court 1 Ruling : The Fourth Amendment applies to searches carried out by school officials, but a school official may conduct a search of a student’s person under certain circumstances. Specifically, the Juvenile Court held that a school official may search a student if the official has reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is in the process of being committed, or has reasonable cause to believe the search is necessary to maintain school discipline or enforce polices. Applying this standard to the facts of this case, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment was not violated by the school administrator’s search. T.L.O. was found delinquent and sentenced to probation for one year.\nLower Court 2 : Appellate Division (New Jersey State Court System)\nLower Court 2 Ruling : Affirmed the Juvenile Court’s decision that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, but vacated the delinquency adjudication and remanded (sent back) the case to the Juvenile Court decide if T.L.O. had knowingly and voluntarily waived her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before confessing.\nLower Court 3 : New Jersey State Supreme Court\nLower Court 3 Ruling : Agreed with the lower courts that the Fourth Amendment is applicable to the conduct of school officials; also agreed that school officials may conduct a warrantless search of a student when they have reasonable grounds to believe that a student possesses evidence of illegal activity or activity that interferes with school discipline and order. However, New Jersey’s highest court ultimately reversed, holding, in T.L.O.’s case, the school administrator’s conduct was not reasonable because the mere possession of cigarettes did not violate school rules. The administrator’s desire to catch T.L.O. in a lie did not justify rummaging through her purse.\nWhether evidence unlawfully seized by a school official – without involvement of law enforcement officials – should be allowed in as evidence at juvenile delinquency proceedings.\nThe Court did not reach this issue. As explained in the reasoning section below, the Court concluded that, under the circumstances of this case, the search of T.L.O.’s purse did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court did not address the issue of whether unlawfully seized evidence should be suppressed in a juvenile delinquency hearing. However, the Court decided that the Fourth Amendment applies to school officials.\nSupreme Court Vote: 6-3\nArgued: March 28, 1984\nRe-argued: October 2, 1984\nDecided: January 15, 1985\nMajority Opinion:\nJustice White\nConcurrences:\nJustice Powell, with Justice Day O’Connor\nJustice Blackmun\nConcurrence in Part and Dissent in Part:\nJustice Brennan, with Justice Marshall\nJustice Stevens, with Justices Marshall and Brennan\nThe Court held that the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures is not limited solely to the actions of law enforcement personnel. It also applies to the conduct of public school officials. Public school teachers act as agents of the state, and not merely agents of the students’ parents. Thus, the Fourth Amendment applies to their actions.\nThe Court also held that students have some legitimate expectation of privacy at school. However, the students’ expectation of privacy must be balanced against the needs of school authorities to maintain an educational environment. As such, school authorities do not need to obtain a warrant or have probable cause that a crime occurred before searching a student. Rather, the reasonableness of a search, under all circumstances, will determine its legality.\nThe Court established the following test to determine the reasonableness of a search: whether the search was 1) justified at its inception and 2) as the search was conducted, was it reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place.\nFinally, the Court evaluated the facts of T.L.O.’s search in light of this test. First, the Court concluded that the search was justified at its inception. The initial report from the teacher that T.L.O. had been smoking in violation of school rules constituted reasonable suspicion that cigarettes were in her purse (a fact that would be relevant to the smoking accusation).\nSecond, the Court noted that the discovery of rolling paper provided reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. possessed marijuana, and this justified the further search of her purse. Since the school administrator’s actions were justified at the inception and were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference, the search was reasonable. Although the Court held that the Fourth Amendment applied to the school administrator’s actions, the court ultimately determined that his actions in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nIn a concurrence, Justice Powell, joined by Justice O’Connor, agreed with the majority’s opinion, but he would have emphasized the fact that, in a school setting, the Constitution may not afford students all of the constitutional protections they would otherwise have in a non-school setting.\nIn a concurrence, Justice Blackmun agreed with the majority. However, he emphasized that the need for school authorities to immediately respond to threats to safety and to protect the education environment would justify a special exception from the Fourth Amendment’s warrant and probable cause requirements for school searches.\nJustice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, concurred in part and dissented in part. Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, agreed with the Court’s finding that the Fourth Amendment applies to public school teachers and that school officials may generally search students without a warrant. However, he disagreed with the Court’s holding that reasonable suspicion as opposed to probable cause should be the test for determining whether such searches may be permitted. Applying the probable cause standard, Justice Brennan held that the school administrator’s actions violated T.L.O.’s rights and, thus, the evidence from the illegal search should be suppressed.\nJustice Stevens, in his concurrence in part and dissent in part, noted that the Court should address the original issue, i.e., whether the exclusionary rule applies to searches made by public school officials and teachers in school. Justice Stevens concluded that the search was not justified at its inception because the school administrator had no reason to believe that T.L.O.’s purse contained evidence of criminal activity or a violation of school rules at the time that he searched it. Thus, the search violated the Fourth Amendment and the evidence should be suppressed.\nDisclaimer (Please Note): This activity is meant to help high school students understand, as part of their civics education, the key facts and holdings of a well-known U.S. Supreme Court case. A link is provided to the Supreme Court decision. This activity is not meant to provide a legal analysis of this case or any related matters. It in no way provides legal advice or guidance on this or other issues.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\nThe provisions of the first Ten Amendments to the Constitution, i.e., the Bill of Rights (1791), originally were applicable only to the federal government, and not to state governments. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. It says, in relevant part, “[N]or shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” In a series of cases starting in 1925, the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the 14th Amendment as “incorporating” (applying) most but not all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states.\nIncorporation of the Fourth Amendment\nIn several cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has incorporated various provisions of the Fourth Amendment, and related judicial rulings, to the states. For instance, in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), the Court held that the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures was applicable to States. Also applicable to the states was the exclusionary rule (a remedy by which evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in court). As a result of these incorporations, the U.S. Supreme Court had the authority to decide whether the actions of the school administrator in T.L.O.’s case violated the U.S. Constitution.\nImportance of State Constitutions\nEach state has its own Constitution, including some form of a state Bill of Rights, as well as laws. The states are free to interpret their Constitutions and laws in a manner that gives more protections to individuals than the U.S. Constitution. However, they cannot interpret them in a manner that gives less protection. The U.S. Supreme Court found that the school administrator’s actions in T.L.O.’s case did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as applied to the states through the 14th Amendment.\nIt is possible that the New Jersey courts, applying the New Jersey Constitution and laws, could find that the school administrator’s actions violated New Jersey’s equivalent of the Fourth Amendment. In Footnote 10 of the majority opinion, Justice White makes this point, saying: “Of course, New Jersey may insist on a more demanding standard under its own Constitution or statutes. In that case, this court would not purport to be applying the Fourth Amendment when they invalidate a search.”\nDISCLAIMER: These resources are created by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts for educational purposes only.

It could mean any place where runoff is stored or directed. So, an eavestrough is essentially a type of gutter.\nIt could be asked then, why is the term ‘gutter’ so common?

For example, it could refer to a gutter along the street or a dug up ditch to catch overflow water. The term ‘eavestrough’, however, specifically refers to a gutter built at the edge of a roof for directing water.\nOne reason for confusing between eavestroughs and gutters could be regional. In some regions, people usually say eavestroughs, and in other, people usually say gutters, even though they are talking about the same thing.

If you’re looking to earn your first Play Button but don’t know how, we’ve covered all the bases in this extensive guide.\nBut, before we jump into the details, let’s first understand what a YouTube Play Button is.\nGiven its rapidly increasing number of creators since the early 2010s, YouTube introduced a reward system to acknowledge its creators’ contributions—the YouTube Play Button , a series of awards you receive after crossing a defined milestone of subscribers and a thorough assessment of your channel.\nReceiving this award is a sign of recognition and acknowledgment of the creator’s hard work.\nFurthermore, it significantly boosts their brand, bringing them more subscribers and enhancing their visibility beyond just YouTube.\nNow, you know what a YouTube play button is. But, how do you actually get a Creator Award? Here are the basic criteria in a nutshell. Keep in mind that even if you meet all these requirements, YouTube still will need to review your channel and make a decision.\nThe basis to receiving a Play Button begins with the number of subscribers your channel has.\n- Silver : 100,000 subscribers\n- Gold: 1,000,000 subscribers\n- Diamond: 10,000,000 subscribers\n- Red Diamond: 100,000,000 subscriber\nBesides the number of subscribers, you also need to have the following:\n- An active Google account.\n- Not have any copyright strikes or issues against Community Guidelines .\n- Follow YouTube’s Terms of Service and advertising guidelines.\n- Not have spammy, scam, or plagiarized content.\nOnce you reach the given milestone of subscribers, YouTube will carefully review your channel to determine your eligibility for the Creator Award.\nThe YouTube Creator Awards is a way to recognize the millions of creators producing content on the platform. For this, you need to grow your audience and stick to the platform’s guidelines while creating spectacular content.\nWhat started with just one award in 2012 is now divided into multiple tiers—silver, gold, and diamond. As recently as 2021, YouTube introduced three more levels of graphite, opal, and bronze. While these are beyond the Creator Awards, they incentivize creators in many ways.\nLet’s take a closer look at the criteria to earn a YouTube Play Button, so you can pave your way towards it.\nThe most crucial parameter to bag a Creator Award is your subscriber count. Until you reach the defined milestone of subscribers, you’re not eligible to apply for these awards. Now, we’ll break down some main criteria other than your subscriber count you should look out for to get your hands on a Creator Award.\nYouTube has extensive community guidelines which detail and regulate the code of conduct and content on the platform. These guidelines bar creators against producing content that:\n- Incites hate or portrays violence\n- Uses inappropriate language\n- Provokes disgust or horror\n- Presents dangerous acts\n- Is sexually explicit.\nBefore you start your YouTube channel, or even if you’re a regular YouTube creator—it’s a good practice to stay updated with the latest YouTube content guidelines so you don’t fall into the grey area. If you violate any part of the guidelines, you might end up with a strike and hit your chances of getting a Creator Award, so best stay safe from it.\nYouTube also punishes creators who violate its content and YouTube copyright guidelines in the form of strikes. You will receive a copyright strike when you publish videos using somebody else’s copyrighted content. The platform will take down your video immediately after they receive such a request.\nWith every copyright strike, you get a ban from accessing some features of your creator account. A copyright strike primarily affects your ability to monetize on YouTube. It also restricts your live streaming feature.

While you should always give yourself a break, it doesn’t mean your YouTube channel should take a break too. Here, a great way to maintain consistency is to batch-create your content and schedule it for publishing.\nBesides, here’s a sustainable framework you can use for consistent content creation and publishing on YouTube:\n- Create a long list of ideas you’d like to work on.\n- Make scripts or prepare the flow for a few ideas during creativity surges.\n- Prepare the raw drafts of multiple videos first and then send them together for editing.\n- Once edited, decide the caption, thumbnails, title, tags, and other details for publishing.\nConsistently pushing content on your YT channel will simplify your journey on how to get a YouTube Play Button.\nOnce you’ve published a decent number of videos, focus on improving your viewership. There’s no straight road to secure more subscribers and ultimately win one of the YouTube Creator Awards.\nYour active viewership ratio will determine your success in the long run. Now, how exactly can you increase this percentage? By optimizing your videos for the YouTube algorithm.\nHere are some tips to optimize your videos for improving your viewership:\n- Title your video with a target keyword.\n- Include keywords in the video description.\n- Add keywords in the video tags as well.\n- Create a custom thumbnail with some engaging text.\n- Categorize your video in the most relevant segment.\nOptimizing your content through these strategies can significantly boost your watch time and increase your viewership count.\nPro tip : Add a splash to your videos’ intro with an opening sequence template from Promo.com’s massive collection .

The definition of quality content can differ for different creators. But take a look at some of the tried-and-tested tips to improve your content’s likeability:\n- Add a personal touch to your content—don’t keep it generic.\n- Follow a narrative or storytelling style to hold your viewers’ attention for long.\n- Create a structured sequence of different clips to make a great flow.\n- Edit your video correctly with text and transition effects for greater appeal.\nCheck out Promo.com ’s intuitive video editor to transform your snippets into professional-looking videos.

Including even a 5-second clip of copyright-protected content in your video can lead to strike one and upset your chance to get the YouTube Creator Awards.\nWhile building a YouTube empire is no cakewalk, your creativity and consistency can take you a long way forward. There are no magic beans to skyrocket your YT channel. But here are some best practices to help you scale your subscriber count:\n- Build a content strategy for your channel: Just like any other social media channel, YouTube content creation also requires a well-thought-out strategy that analyzes what your target audience wants and how you can create content that will solve their problems. This strategy will help you stay consistent, measure results, actively get more eyes to your channel, and increase your subscriber count.\n- Analyze your videos to see what’s working best: No marketing strategy can work well without evaluating if your efforts translate into results for the audience and your channel. Use YouTube analytics and even third-party platforms to see what’s working best for your subscribers and double down on it to create the right kind of content to attract more subscribers.\n- Get professional assistance to get more eyes to your channel: YouTube success isn’t limited to great content. It requires a carefully curated SEO, content, social media, and advertising strategy along with great production and content to stand apart from the millions of creators on the channel and compel your audience to hit the “subscribe” button. Your best bet would be to hire a professional after organically growing your channel for a while to reap the maximum benefits. This will free your time to create better content and ensure that it’s being distributed the right way to get more viewers and subscribers.\n- Invest in more resources to automate processes and boost your growth: Since maintaining a YouTube channel extends beyond content creation, you need to automate processes like publishing, scheduling, editing, and analytics using tools or a dedicated YouTube content team. This will optimize your time, ensure everything is done properly and give you plenty of time to ace your content game.\nUltimately, the secret to boosting your subscriber count lies in creating content that your audience likes, experimenting with it and staying consistent with content creation. So, find your audience’s pulse, and create content they’ll discover, love and share—to boost your subscriber count.\nAll YouTube Play Buttons are awarded at different subscriber levels.

The 27-year old content creator creates content around technology under the pet name, MKBHD.\nEarning this prestigious award will take as much hard work as time commitment.

This Ruby Play Button is customized with the channel’s logo and celebrates the grand milestone of building a YouTube audience that’s equivalent to the population of South Korea.\nOnly 27 channels have managed to secure a YouTube Ruby Play Button to date, highlighting how rare it is to reach this landmark.\nYouTube’s original reward system for creators included only three tiers—silver, gold, diamond. But one creator managed to break all records and hit the landmark subscriber count of 50 million. That’s when the world’s biggest video-sharing platform introduced a new Creator Award—the Custom Play Button.\nThe first-ever receiver of the Custom Play Button is PewDiePie , a Swedish YouTuber. He reached the milestone of 50 million subscribers in December 2016 and received a custom award with his YT logo\nYou can earn a Custom Play Button only when you surpass 50 million followers. Given the massive milestone, it’s natural that only 27 select creators have managed to achieve this extraordinary feat.\nBut the award’s rarity doesn’t affect your chances of reaching the landmark if you are working hard on your channel. But it requires a lot of hard work, a great team behind top-notch content production, a rock-solid marketing strategy and definitely, consistency and determination.\nThe Kids Diana Show is a great example of this—it’s the world’s 5 th -most subscribed channel with over 85 million followers globally. The channel is about a young girl named Diana, who shows her playtime activities with her brother.

But since the creators reach the defined milestone of followers, they can monetize their YT channel.\nYou can get your hands on your first YouTube Play Button after reaching 100,000 subscribers for your channel. However, there’s no guarantee of receiving the Silver Play Button even after surpassing this milestone. This is because YouTube holds the sole discretion to reward creators who meet all the guidelines for publishing content.

The platform revamped the look of all its Creator Awards in 2018 and designed a new plaque in a sleeker style.\nThe Diamond Play Button, awarded at the achievement of 1 million subscribers, is not made out of real diamonds.

Stroud second overall, the Texans traded up nine slots, from 12 to three in the first round, to take Alabama defensive end Will Anderson . Houston GM Nick Caserio traded 12 and 34 this year and first- and third-round picks next year to just barely squeeze the trade into the NFL’s 10-minute window for the third pick. As I explain in the next item about Arizona’s draft, Houston could be picking very early next year—which will put a white hot spotlight of pressure on Anderson.\nCaserio told me at NRG Stadium that Stroud was clearly the team’s target at two. He’d had some discussions with Cards GM Monti Ossenfort about possibly moving from 12 to three. “Then,” Caserio said, “it happened pretty quickly when they were on the clock.”\nThe deal got done and all parties notified, he said, with “close to a minute” left. So the Texans got a player they hope will be their franchise QB, and they got the best defensive player on their board. That is one heck of a night’s work. The price, of course, is denuding the 2024 draft when the Texans might wish they had two first-round picks and four in the first three rounds—instead of now just one first-round pick, one second- and no thirds.\nBut – and there is a big but – you should have been at the Texans’ facility in the basement of NRG Stadium late Friday afternoon, when Stroud and Anderson put on a show of humility and team-firstness that had to make Texans fans so weary of losing (a league-worst 11-38-1 in the last three years) happy for the first time since the Wild Card win over Buffalo three years ago.\nStroud and Anderson came with their families and made it clear they were all-in on going to a losing team after years of nothing but winning in college. Afterward, Stroud told me: “That’s what life is about, working to build something good. That’s what I’m here to help this team do. I’m ready for it.”\nThe Texans have asked Stroud to let the S-2 Test controversy go, but he got a couple last licks in on it. A player who played the way Stroud did—particularly in putting up 41 points in his superb final college game in the playoff against Georgia—is not a player who can’t process, or can’t ID a defense. I understand using every tool in the bag to analyze players before the draft, and I’d check out why Stroud scored low on the test. But to think it’s a good indicator of future failure—I mean, watch the games he’s played.\nWe stood in a hallway just off the Texans’ locker room for 12 minutes and I asked him about what he’s learned from the last three months.\n“Humility is something I’m not afraid of,” Stroud said. “It’s something I’m accustomed to. This was all probably just a humble moment God wanted me to go through.\n“ A lot of people haven’t played the sport, and I mean critics are gonna critique. For me I know the film speaks for itself. Everything that I’ve done in college, I’ve been very consistent. I think I’ve been one of the most consistent players in college football for the last two years. If you turn on the tape, you can see, you can answer the questions. But those who don’t understand tape might want to go to other things and analyze other things. They’re more than welcome to do such. But the people who are making the choices and the picks, they knew what I can do. They understood the IQ that I do have.\n“I have a great memory when it comes to football,” Stroud added. “I feel like there’s different ways to be geniuses. You don’t just have to be book smart. You can be analytics smart. You can be numbers smart. You can be football smart. I really think that there’s different types of ways to be smart. That’s something that I pride myself on. And I am book smart. I did have over a 3.0 in college. I had over a 3.0 in high school. I know that I can think. I can process very, very fast. The film, you can see me going from first option to second and then back to one and then to three to four if I have to. I can check down. I can use my feet.\n“But, you know, everything happens for a reason. I’m not upset. I’m actually blessed, I’m super blessed to be a Texan. Number two overall pick in the NFL draft, man. A little kid from the [California] Inland Empire. All smiles, man. I ain’t tripping about this.”\nGood attitude to have. But at the same time, I could feel it: C.J. Stroud will remember this pre-draft process. And for the Texans, that bit of motivation will be a very good thing.\nHENDERSON, Nev.—Just before noon on Thursday, hours before the start of the NFL Draft, Raiders coach Josh McDaniels popped into GM Dave Ziegler ’s office for one last bit of strategy talk. The team’s draft board had been set with finality Wednesday, after three months of debate. The Raiders, after conversations with teams above them about trading up from number seven in the first round, decided to stay in their slot, barring a surprise.\n“What we need is for three quarterbacks to go before we pick,” McDaniels said.\nIt seemed logical, with Carolina going Bryce Young at number one and then Houston at two and Indianapolis at four and Seattle at five all in the QB market. But nothing in this draft after Carolina was a sure thing. All McDaniels and Ziegler knew was that these four non-QBs sat at the top of their board a short spiral away, graded closely:\nBut as Ziegler and McDaniels hashed it out, and McDaniels talked about the latest intel he’d heard about the top six (“I hope I’ll have something coming in on Houston at two, but Nick’s tight,” he said, referring to Texans GM/CIA agent Nick Caserio ), they realized they were just like the rest of America: They doubted Houston would pick a quarterback at two, they didn’t know which GM was fixing to pay a ransom to trade up with Arizona at three, they didn’t know which quarterback Indianapolis would choose at four, and they didn’t know if Seattle would go QB or best defensive weapon at five.\nNo surprise, all this mystery. This is the modern draft, where lips are no longer loose, where mock drafts are a mockery of reality. It sounds counterintuitive, but in the hours before the NFL Draft, the people running drafts for $6 billion franchises didn’t know much more than the rest of us. Ziegler and McDaniels did know by staying put—and they would get a phone call that surprised and tempted them minutes before their pick—they were not in control of their fate. They needed help. The Raiders needed two teams post-Carolina to pick passers in the next five picks. Likely. Not certain.\nAt 4:43 p.m. Pacific Time, Ziegler was on his way into the draft room, a large square conference room on the third floor of the Raiders’ facility six miles west of the Vegas Strip. He stopped by the floor-to-ceiling photograph of the man who lords over this franchise 12 years after his death, and Ziegler patted the photograph of Al Davis .\n“Goosebumps,” Ziegler said. “I feel his presence every day.”\nThen Ziegler—47, in gray suit, black Oxford shirt, no tie, white and black sneakers—entered the draft room, where 13 scouts, personnel people, one coach and one owner would plot the immediate future of Al Davis’ team. At 4:59 p.m., 11 minutes before the draft kicked off, owner Mark Davis slipped into the room, in his white satin Raiders jacket and stonewashed faded jeans.\n“Gameday, baby!” Son of Al announced to the room.\nGameday, as Mark Davis said. “We’re still undefeated!” Davis said as Roger Goodell kicked off the draft. One wall taken up entirely with the draft board, ranking the players by position from top to bottom, on magnetic cards, the old-school way. One wall, controlled by pro personnel director Dwayne Joseph , with pick-by-pick order and team-by-team needs that change with every pick. One wall, which McDaniels, Ziegler, assistant GM Champ Kelly and Davis face, with three things: a big TV tuned to the draft, computerized pick-by-pick directly from the league, so it’s faster than what you see on TV, and a constantly updated list of trade discussions with draft-trade charts showing trade proposals broken down by a value chart.\nKelly, Ziegler (cell phone to his ear at least half of the evening), McDaniels, Davis, left to right in front of the room, in swivel chairs, able to look ahead at trade possibilities or back at the state of the draft board. Ziegler flitted from senior personnel adviser Shaun Herock to McDaniels to Davis to Kelly to director of football analytics David Christoff to senior national scouts DuJuan Daniels, Andy Dengler and Lenny McGill , having mostly hushed conversations.\n5:18 p.m. PT: Panthers picked Young. “This is where the draft starts,” Ziegler, stating the obvious, said.\nFour minutes later, the tinny voice from draft headquarters said, “Houston has made its pick. Arizona now on the clock.” All eyes turn to the board where the pick will show up first. C.J. Stroud , QB, Ohio State popped onto the screen. “Oooooh,” someone in the room said. Seven minutes passed. Arizona traded down to 12 with Houston. Big compensation: For this pick and a fourth- this year, the Texans gave the Colts the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks this year and their first- and third-round picks next year.\n5:32 p.m.: Will Anderson to Houston at three. One Vegas target down.\n5:33 p.m.: Ziegler on his cell, briefly. Ziegler to McDaniels in a hushed tone: “Arizona wants to trade back up.”\nZiegler and McDaniels stared at the trade-value board in the back of the room, analyzing trade possibilities—the values, plus or minus for the Raiders, based on the numerical values Ziegler assigns to each pick:\n1-7 down to 1-12\nPotential Counters\n+177 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 4 th (109)\n+68 ARI sends 2-33 and 6-213, LV gives back 3-100 and 4-109\n+30 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 3-70\nAt 5:37 p.m., Anthony Richardson , the Florida quarterback, got picked by the Colts. The third quarterback was off the board. McDaniels beamed. He and Ziegler slapped hands. Now the Raiders were sure to get one of their four guys.\n5:42 p.m.: Cards GM Monti Ossenfort called Ziegler. Hushed discussion, presumably exchanging potential offers for the pick. Then Ziegler and McDaniels huddled. Having the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks, to go along with the Raiders’ 38 th choice, would be tempting. “We could get [Oklahoma tackle Anton] Harrison at 12,” McDaniels said. The Raiders loved Harrison—not as much as Johnson, but enough maybe to lose the fourth non-QB they love in order to pick up the 33 rd pick. They mulled.\nThe phone went cold for a few minutes. Seemed obvious Ossenfort wanted Paris Johnson . He had to be dealing with Detroit, trying to get ahead of Vegas to ensure getting Johnson. Smart move by Ossenfort, choosing not to close a deal for the seventh pick and instead dealing for the sixth–ensuring that the Cards would get the tackle they wanted.\n5:47 p.m.: Witherspoon to Seattle at five. Detroit up. No action on Ziegler’s phone. Not surprising. Arizona was targeting Johnson.\n5:50 p.m.: Tinny voice from Draft HQ: “Detroit has traded its pick to Arizona. Arizona is on the clock.” For Vegas, there goes day-one starting right tackle Paris Johnson.\n5:54 p.m. Paris Johnson to Arizona. “Las Vegas is on the clock,” tinny voice says.\nSo no real drama. The plan was preordained. There was no real debate now, no discussion about moving. Only this:\n5:58 p.m.: “Tyree, this is coach McDaniels. We’re gonna turn the pick in here, and you’re gonna be a Raider.”\nIn a lull in front of the room, McDaniels said quietly: “Our board was right. We needed three quarterbacks to go, and we’re so happy we got one of the four non-quarterbacks who were our top-rated guys on the board. Look, we gotta rush the passer. We gotta go get [ Patrick] Mahomes and [ Justin] Herbert . That’s four games a year for the next few years against these great young quarterbacks. And the AFC is full of these great young quarterbacks. This is a great outcome for us.”\nThis is the draft. The Raiders needed long-term help opposite Maxx Crosby (edge player Chandler Jones is 33), and Anderson or Wilson would have been great. Witherspoon would have been great to add to a needy secondary. Johnson would have been great to bookend Kolton Miller . It’s capricious. The choice wasn’t up to Ziegler; other teams decided for him. But the vibe in the room, the smiles, showed this staff loves Wilson, even with the foot injury that made him an iffy candidate to some teams.\nIn his office 20 minutes later, McDaniels waited to be connected to Wilson to converse. “I mean, hallelujah,” McDaniels said. “His motivation, his drive, how he handles adversity … off the charts. We value the TAP test (a test in the pre-draft process that measures mental toughness, drive and composure under pressure), and Tyree got one of the highest grades on it, a Green plus-plus. He’ll fit in great here.”\nMcDaniels’ football ops guy, Tom Jones , walked in with a phone. Wilson. “Tyree, welcome to the nation,” McDaniels said. “Dude, I am so excited you’re a Raider. I know you’re gonna help us win a lot of games. So, just wanted to touch base on a few things. You’re gonna talk to the media here in a bit. Wanted to give you a few points. Be humble, which you are. Stay away from predictions—that way, you won’t have to eat them later. Don’t talk about timelines with your foot. You don’t want your draft story to be all about your foot. Now, you got a fan base that’s second to none. They’re gonna love you. Just express how excited you—which I know you are.”\nBack in the Raiders draft room, after pick 19, Ziegler said, “Josh, you wanna look at trades?” On the board were four players with similar grades: Georgia defensive end Nolan Smith , Maryland corner Deonte Banks , Harrison the Oklahoma tackle, and Arkansas linebacker Drew Sanders . Close to them: Notre Dame tight end Michael Mayer .\nBut there wasn’t much enthusiasm to deal after Banks and Harrison went off the board. Ziegler made a couple of calls about moving up to fill a hole left by the trade of tight end Darren Waller with Mayer, but never got far—or appeared enthusiastic to do it.\n7:36 p.m.: Crosby sent a video message to Wilson, and in the draft room, Ziegler had it and he showed it to McDaniels and Davis on his phone. The tenor of the message: Congrats, Tyree. Now, time to go work, son. “Love it,” McDaniels said.\nThere are lulls in all drafts, and after Banks and Harrison went at 24 and 27, this was the Raider lull. Davis kept things interesting. When the TV showed a crestfallen Will Levis , undrafted, still in the green room in Kansas City, he said: “Someone should tell him careers are not made on draft day. Tell him this happened to Aaron Rodgers too.” And when he looked up and saw speedy Jalin Hyatt , the wide receiver, still on the board with a high Raider grade, Davis said to McDaniels: “Too bad we don’t have a need at receiver. Can he run?”\n“Like the wind,” McDaniels said.\nDavis started laughing, like he could sense Ziegler and McDaniels did not want him to start lobbying for the best speed receiver in the draft.\n“It’s part of my DNA,” Davis said. “I see a fast receiver, I want him. I can’t help it.” Spoken like his father’s son.\nAs the round wound down, quietly, I asked Davis what he thought of Ziegler and McDaniels, the ex-Pats, entering year two of their regime. “I like ‘em,” he said. “When we hired them, everybody thought we were trying to re-create the Patriots. That wasn’t it. I was trying to find two great football men. Now, this is their chance to build something. They’re young, they love football, and I’m thrilled with them. It’s a huge weekend for them.\n“My dad’s drafts were different—a lot more tense.”\n“The tense conversations were already had,” McDaniels said later. “We had them in the last six weeks. We ended up with the board where we all felt it needed to be.”\n8:30 p.m.: Two picks left, including Kansas City at 31. Mayer on the mind in the draft room. “If KC comes back to us,” Ziegler said, “wanna do it?”\n“Yes,” said McDaniels.\n“Best tight end in the draft,” Kelly said.\nShort conversation with KC. “Not gonna work,” Ziegler said. KC would have given 31 and 217 (sixth round) for 38 and 70, a net on the points chart of minus-147. “Too many players we like,” Ziegler said. (Ziegler, on Friday, traded from 38 to 35 with the Colts to snag Mayer, the tight end Vegas wanted above all.)\nAn hour after the round ended, McDaniels and Ziegler unwound in the draft room. Wilson underwent surgery by the top athletic foot surgeon in the field, Dr. Robert Anderson, to repair a fracture last Nov. 21. Six weeks ago, Anderson sent a letter to each team, saying Wilson has responded “extremely well” to surgery. The Raiders expect Wilson to be ready to play this season on schedule. “Our doctors ultimately felt like it was something that we were going to be okay with,” Ziegler said. “If we wouldn’t have felt comfortable with it, we wouldn’t have [picked Wilson].”\nIn all, the needy Raiders, trying to rebound from a few years of failed top picks, got two likely starters out of the draft—Wilson and Mayer. After that, it’s up in the air, as all drafts are. The Raiders got their presumptive backup to Jimmy Garoppolo , Aidan O’Connell , in the middle of the fourth round—about two rounds earlier than the consensus of where he deserved to go. They got a speed cornerback, Banks’ teammate Jakorian Bennett , with pick 104, and the Raiders hope he plays early.\nMel Kiper, for one, liked the first two picks but the others, not so much. After the top two, Kiper said, “I don’t see value with the rest of this class.”\nThat’s why they play the games. In three years, we’ll see if Ziegler picked right in the NFL’s 88 th draft."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

[1] The term (sometimes spelled \"pinky\") is common in Scottish English [2] and American English , [3] and is also used extensively in other Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand, Canada, and Australia. [4] [5]\nThe little finger is nearly impossible for most people to bend independently (without also bending the ring finger), due to the nerves for each digit being intertwined. [ citation needed ] There are also nine muscles that control the fifth digit: Three in the hypothenar eminence , two extrinsic flexors, two extrinsic extensors, and two more intrinsic muscles:\n- Hypothenar eminence:\n- Two extrinsic flexors:\nNote: the dorsal interossei of the hand muscles do not have an attachment to the fifth digit\nAmong American children, a \" pinky swear \" or \"pinky promise\" is made when a person wraps one of their pinky fingers around another person's pinky and makes a promise . [6] Something similar is also seen in China and Korea, where people link their pinky fingers and then stamp their thumbs together to make a yaksok (promise).\nAmong members of the Japanese yakuza (gangsters), the penalty for various offenses is removal of parts of the little finger (known as yubitsume ). [7]\nIt is a common misconception that one should extend their little finger when drinking from a teacup. This practice is generally deprecated by etiquette guides as a sign of snobbery amongst the socially inferior, [8] [9] with various cultural theories as to the origin of the practice including the idea that finger food should be eaten with only the first three digits. [10]\nThe messaging application Teams from Microsoft [11] has an emoji which is a representation of a closed hand with the little finger raised. The description is \"Nature's call\" which is a polite euphemism used when someone feels a need to urinate or defecate. [12]\nThe signet ring is traditionally worn on the little finger of a gentleman's left hand, a practice still common especially in the United Kingdom , Australia , and European cultures. A signet ring is considered part of the regalia of many European monarchies, and also of the Pope, with the ring always worn on the left little finger. In modern times the location of the signet ring has relaxed, with examples worn on various different digits, although little fingers still tend to be the most usual.\nThe Iron Ring is a symbolic ring worn by most Canadian engineers . The Ring is a symbol of both pride and humility for the engineering profession, and is always worn on the little finger of the dominant hand . In the United States , the Engineer's Ring is a stainless steel ring worn on the fifth digit of the working hand by engineers who belong to the Order of the Engineer [13] and have accepted the Obligation of an Engineer. [14]\nThe little finger is often used as a support when smartphone users type one-handed. The little finger is positioned underneath the phone, allowing it to be propped with the three middle fingers, and the user to type with their thumb. [15]\nSome users reported dents on their little finger and pain in the hand after prolonged use in this way, doctors referred to this as \"iPhone pinky\" or \"smartphone pinky\". The skin indentations were reported to be nothing of alarm, as they disappeared on their own after a short while without cell phone use.

Produced by Mark Ronson , the lyrics are autobiographical and address Winehouse's refusal to enter a rehabilitation clinic . \"Rehab\" was released as the lead single from Back to Black in 2006, and it peaked at number 7 in the United Kingdom on its Singles Chart and number 9 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100 , [2] [3] becoming Winehouse's only top 10 hit in the US.\n\"Rehab\" became an international critical and commercial success, and has been referred to as Winehouse's signature song . [4] [5] It won three Grammy Awards at the 50th ceremony , including Record of the Year , Song of the Year , and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance . [6] It also won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song. [7] Winehouse's public battle with drug and alcohol addiction , and subsequent death, have contributed to the song's continuing popularity and appearance in the media. The song has been covered by a number of artists, including Taking Back Sunday , Justin Timberlake , Fergie , and Kanye West .\n\"Rehab\" was produced by Mark Ronson and released as the album's lead single in 2006 in the UK. The song addresses Winehouse's refusal to attend an alcohol rehabilitation centre after her management team encouraged her to go. Ronson expanded on the songwriting process when interviewed by DJ Zane Lowe for the BBC Radio 's Radio 1's Stories , in an episode broadcast on BBC Radio 1 on Monday 18 July 2011, 5 days before her death:\nMitch Winehouse, Amy's father, confirms Ronson's story about the origins of the song in his biography, Amy, My Daughter (2012). He writes that Ronson and Winehouse inspired each other musically, adding that Amy had written that line in one of her notebooks years before and told him that she was planning to write a song about that day. After Ronson heard the line during his and Amy's conversation in New York, he suggested they turn it into a song. The book says that was the moment when the song \"came to life\". [8]\nIn the film Amy , director Asif Kapadia showed an interview with Mitch in which he explained that \"he didn't believe [Winehouse] needed treatment [for her drug and alcohol addiction]\". In an appearance on the British talk show Loose Women , Mitch clarified the comments he made in the film, saying that Kapadia misinterpreted what he actually said to Winehouse: \"[...] I say that Amy didn't need to go to rehab, right? What I actually said was – referring to 2005 – Amy didn't need to go to rehab at that point. Later on was a different story altogether, which gives a totally, completely different meaning to what I said.\" [9]\n\"Rehab\" is a soul and R&B song. [10] [11] In the lyrics Winehouse mentions \"Ray\" and \"Mr. Hathaway\", in reference to Ray Charles and Donny Hathaway .\n\"Rehab\" received universal acclaim from music critics . Rolling Stone characterised it as a \" Motown -style winner with a banging beat and a lovesick bad girl testifying like Etta James .\" [12] People magazine called the track \"instantly memorable.\" [13] Billboard remarked that Winehouse's vocals on the song were \" Shirley Bassey -meets- Ella Fitzgerald \" and called the track \"a better buzz than a double-gin martini.\" [10] British trade paper Music Week called the song a \"classy treat\", praising Ronson's production and noting that the track's \"overall effect is one of adroit skill with great hooks\". [14]\n\"Rehab\" ranked number 7 on Rolling Stone ' s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007 and number 194 on the same magazine's updated list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . [15] [16] This song also placed at number 92 on MTV Asia ' s list of Top 100 Hits of 2007. [17] Time magazine named \"Rehab\" at number one on their 10 Best Songs of 2007. Writer Josh Tyrangiel praised Winehouse for her confidence, opining, \"What she is is mouthy, funny, sultry, and quite possibly crazy\" and, \"It's impossible not to be seduced by her originality. Combine it with production by Mark Ronson that references four decades worth of soul music without once ripping it off, and you've got the best song of 2007.\" [18] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Soon she'd be making headlines for all the wrong reasons. But back in 2007, we were all saying yes, yes, yes to the British belter's one-of-a-kind voice.\" [19] In 2011, NME placed it at number 8 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years.\" [20]\nThe song won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song for songwriting on 24 May 2007. [21] In July 2007, the track won the Popjustice £20 Music Prize , which recognises the best British pop singles over the past year. In doing so, Winehouse became the third act to win the award, after Girls Aloud and Rachel Stevens . [22] The single was voted as the best song of 2007 at The Village Voice ' s annual Pazz & Jop . [23] On 10 February 2008 , \"Rehab\" won three Grammy Awards : Record of the Year , Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance . [24]\nBased solely on download sales, \"Rehab\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number nineteen and when the physical single was released the following week, it climbed to number seven, Winehouse's highest chart position at the time by more than 50 places. By 25 October, the album was approaching five-time platinum in the UK, making it the best-selling record of 2007. [25]\nThe song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 91 on the 31 March 2007 chart without an official single release. Winehouse's current single at the time, \" You Know I'm No Good \", entered one spot above, at number 90, the same week. [26] After lingering in the bottom portions of the Hot 100 for several months, the song suddenly jumped 38 spots to number ten on the 23 June chart, [27] due to digital sales following Winehouse's live performance of the song on the MTV Movie Awards on 3 June 2007; sales of the official remix featuring rapper Jay-Z also had a small effect, helping it to peak in the 70s on the iTunes Top 100 in the US. After a change of rules in the UK allowing all digital downloads to be counted for the singles chart, \"Rehab\" re-entered the chart at number 20 for the week ending 13 January 2007, whilst \"You Know I'm No Good\" occupied the number 40 spot as a new entry on downloads alone.\nThe Ronson-produced song also topped at the top ten in more than 10 countries including Canada, Spain, Denmark, and Israel, peaking at number one in Norway and Hungary. It reached the top 20 in France, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and Finland, attaining a peak position of number 23 on the European Hot 100 Singles .\nBetween October 2006 and June 2007, the single spent 34 consecutive weeks in the official UK top 75 and has re-entered it again several times since, most recently at number 29 on 31 July 2011 in the wake of the singer's death, giving it a current total of 59 weeks in the top 75, making it the joint 10th longest runner of all time, and 76 in the top 100.\nIt also became her first top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number nine. The Recording Industry Association of America certified \"Rehab\" platinum on 11 February 2010 for sales of over 1 million copies. [28] The song was an enduring hit throughout 2007; with UK sales of 131,415 in 2007 alone, it finished the year as the UK's fifth-sixth biggest-selling single. It is Winehouse's longest-running UK chart hit, but her Ronson collaboration \"Valerie\" has proven to be her biggest seller to date.\nThe music video was directed by Phil Griffin and released in September 2006. It was shot at 33 Portland Place in London, a large Georgian residence built in 1775 and used in many music videos of the era due to its grand and largely original interior. It features Winehouse's band playing their instruments while she sings to the camera. The band members are wearing dressing gowns/bath robes throughout the video, with one member dressed similarly to Donny Hathaway . It begins with Winehouse rising from bed and then moving to the bathroom. For the second verse, Winehouse is on a chair in a psychiatrist's office, presumably explaining herself to an unseen therapist. In contrast to the lyrics, the video ends with Winehouse in rehab, sitting on a bed in a white-tiled clinical ward room with her band around her. The video was shot by director of photography Adam Frisch, FSF. On 31 May 2007, \"Rehab\" debuted on MTV's Total Request Live and later peaked at number one on 7 June. [29] The music video was also nominated for Video of the Year at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards , but lost out to Rihanna 's \" Umbrella .\"\nOn 12 March 2007, Winehouse performed the song live for her US television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman . [30] For a while, she replaced \"Ray\" with \"Blake\", referring to her ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, in live performances. She also replaced several times the lyrics, \"I'm gonna lose my baby\", with, \"I'll never lose my baby\".\n|No.||Title||Length|\n|1.||\"Rehab\" (Album Version)||3:36|\n|2.||\"Do Me Good\"||4:20|\n|No.||Title||Length|\n|1.||\"Rehab\" (Album Version)||3:36|\n|2.||\"Close to the Front\"||4:35|\n|3.||\"Rehab\" (Desert Eagle Discs Vocal Mix)||5:00|\n|No.||Title||Length|\n|1.||\"Rehab (Hot Chip Vocal Remix)\" (Hot Chip Remix)||6:58|\n|2.||\"Rehab (Pharoahe Monch Remix)\" (Amy Winehouse vs Pharoahe Monch)||3:36|\n|3.||\"Rehab (Vodafone Live)\" (Live at TBA)||3:40|\n|No.||Title||Length|\n|1.||\"Rehab (Remix)\" (featuring Jay Z)||3:52|\n|2.||\"Rehab (Pharoahe Monch Remix)\" (Amy Winehouse vs Pharoahe Monch)||3:36|\n|No.||Title||Length|\n|1.||\"Rehab\" (Demo Version)||3:38|\n|2.||\"Rehab\" (Vodafone Live at TBA)||3:41|\n|3.||\"Rehab\" (Hot Chip Remix)||6:58|\n|4.||\"Rehab\" (Pharoahe Monch Remix)||3:36|\n|5.||\"Rehab\" (featuring Jay Z)||3:52|\n|Chart (2006)||Position|\n|UK Singles ( OCC ) [70]||85|\n|Chart (2007)||Position|\n|Austria ( Ö3 Austria Top 40 ) [71]||68|\n|Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Flanders) [72]||41|\n|European Hot 100 Singles ( Billboard ) [73]||53|\n|Hungary ( Rádiós Top 40 ) [74]||16|\n|Netherlands ( Single Top 100 ) [75]||70|\n|Switzerland ( Schweizer Hitparade ) [76]||38|\n|UK Singles ( OCC ) [77]||56|\n|US Billboard Hot 100 [78]||74|\n|US Dance/Mix Show Airplay ( Billboard ) [79]||24|\n|Chart (2008)||Position|\n|Austria ( Ö3 Austria Top 40 ) [80]||69|\n|Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Flanders) [81]||69|\n|Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Wallonia) [82]||53|\n|Hungary ( Rádiós Top 40 ) [83]||21|\n|Spain ( PROMUSICAE ) [84]||16|\n|Switzerland ( Schweizer Hitparade ) [85]||45|\n|UK Singles ( OCC ) [86]||200|\n|Region||Certification||Certified units /sales|\n|Belgium ( BEA ) [87]||Gold||25,000 *|\n|Denmark ( IFPI Danmark ) [88]||Platinum||15,000 ^|\n|Germany ( BVMI ) [89]||Platinum||300,000|\n|Italy ( FIMI ) [90]||Platinum||30,000 *|\n|New Zealand ( RMNZ ) [91]||Gold||7,500 *|\n|Spain ( PROMUSICAE ) [92]||3× Platinum||60,000 ^|\n|Switzerland ( IFPI Switzerland) [93]||Platinum||30,000 ^|\n|United Kingdom ( BPI ) [94]||Platinum||600,000|\n|United States ( RIAA ) [96]||Platinum||2,000,000 [95]|\n* Sales figures based on certification alone.\nSeveral musicians have released covers and alternate versions of the song.\n- During live performances, New York band Taking Back Sunday often includes the chorus of a popular song in \"A Decade Under the Influence\" and the breakdown of \"Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)\", and, beginning in 2007, \"Rehab\" has been used.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "In poker, if a pot is split because of tied hands, the odd chip is awarded to the hand that contains the highest-ranking single card.", "reference_documents": ["From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nIn poker it is sometimes necessary to split , or divide the pot among two or more players rather than awarding it all to a single player. This can happen because of ties, and also by playing intentional split-pot poker variants (the most typical of these is high-low split poker , where the high hand and low hand split the pot).\nTo split a pot, one player uses both hands to take the chips from the pot and make stacks, placing them side by side to compare height (and therefore value). Equal stacks are placed aside. If there is more than one denomination of chip in the pot, the largest value chip is done first, and then progressively smaller value chips. If there is an odd number of larger chips, smaller chips from the pot can be used to equalize stacks or make change as necessary. Pots are always split down to the lowest denomination of chip used in the game. Three-way ties or further splits can also be done this way.\nAfter fully dividing a pot, there may be a single odd lowest-denomination chip remaining (or two odd chips if splitting three ways, etc.). Odd chips can be awarded in several ways, agreed upon before the beginning of the game. The following rules are common:\n- If playing a high-low split game and dividing a pot between the high and low hands, always award the odd chip to the high hand.\n- If splitting a pot because of tied hands, award the odd chip to the hand that contains the highest-ranking single card, using suits to break ties if necessary (clubs ranking the lowest, followed by diamonds, hearts, and spades as in bridge ).\n- (Variation) Between tied hands, award the odd chip to the first player in clockwise rotation from the dealer. (Note that in a casino stud game with a house dealer and no button this gives an unfair advantage to players on the dealer's left, so the high card by suit method is preferred).\n- (Variation) Leave the odd chip as an extra ante for the next deal. This is common in home games.\nSometimes it is necessary to further split a half pot into quarters, or even smaller portions. This is especially common in community card high-low split games such as Omaha hold'em , where one player has the high hand and two or more players have tied low hands. Unfortunate players receiving such a fractional pot call it being quartered . When this happens, an exception to the odd chip rules above can be made: if the high hand wins its half of the pot alone, and the low half is going to be quartered, the odd chip (if any) from the first split should be placed in the low half, rather than being awarded to the high hand."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

It is the sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and the 15th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by James Gunn , the film stars an ensemble cast featuring Chris Pratt , Zoe Saldaña , Dave Bautista , Vin Diesel , Bradley Cooper , Michael Rooker , Karen Gillan , Pom Klementieff , Sylvester Stallone , and Kurt Russell . In the film, the Guardians travel throughout the cosmos as they help Peter Quill learn more about his mysterious parentage.\nThe film was officially announced at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International before the theatrical release of the first film, along with James Gunn's return from the first film, with the title of the sequel revealed a year later in June 2015. Principal photography began in February 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia , with many crew changes from the first film due to other commitments. Filming concluded in June 2016. James Gunn chose to set the sequel shortly after the first film to explore the characters' new roles as the Guardians, and to follow the storyline of Quill's father established throughout that previous film. Russell was confirmed as Quill's father in July 2016, portraying Ego, a departure from Quill's comic father.\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 premiered in Tokyo on April 10, 2017, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2017, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. It grossed more than $863 million worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2017 , while also outgrossing its predecessor. The film received praise for its visuals, direction, soundtrack, humor, and performances, though some critics deemed it inferior to the original. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 90th Academy Awards . A sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 , will be released on May 5, 2023, preceded by the Disney+ special The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special in November 2022.\nIn 2014, Peter Quill , Gamora , Drax , Rocket , and Baby Groot are renowned as the Guardians of the Galaxy . Ayesha , leader of the Sovereign race, has the Guardians protect valuable batteries from Abilisk, an inter-dimensional monster, in exchange for Gamora's estranged sister Nebula , who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After Rocket steals the batteries for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. A mysterious figure destroys the drones and the Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet. There, this figure reveals himself as Quill's father, Ego , and invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet. Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and guard Nebula.\nMeanwhile, Ayesha hires Yondu Udonta and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community for child trafficking , to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his lieutenant Kraglin Obfonteri questions his objectivity, and another lieutenant, Taserface , leads a mutiny, aided by Nebula. Taserface imprisons Rocket and Yondu aboard the latter's ship and executes his loyalists. Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by their adoptive father, Thanos . Groot and Kraglin, the latter having never intended to start the mutiny, free Rocket and Yondu. Using Yondu's arrow, the group destroys the ship and its crew while escaping. Taserface warns the Sovereign before dying.\nEgo, a god-like Celestial that manipulated the matter around his consciousness to form his \"home\" planet, explains that he projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother Meredith . Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered, and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate the Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds that can terraform into new extensions of himself, but only the power of two Celestials can activate them. To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect some of the children, but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power. At first, under Ego's influence, Quill fights back when Ego reveals that he gave Meredith the brain tumor that killed her due to the distraction she posed, forcing Ego to parasitically draw Quill's energy to activate the seedlings, which begin to consume every world.\nMantis , Ego's naïve empath servant, grows close to Drax and warns him of Ego's plan. Gamora and Nebula also learn of the plan as Rocket, Yondu, Groot, and Kraglin arrive. The reunited Guardians travel to Ego's brain at the planet's core, during which Yondu reveals that he kept Quill to spare him from the fate of Ego's other progeny. As they come under attack from the Sovereign's drones, Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on the brain. Quill fights Ego with his newfound Celestial powers to distract him long enough for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet. Quill loses his Celestial powers soon after Ego's death. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill and dies in the vacuum of space. Having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula still chooses to leave and resume her quest to kill Thanos by herself. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which Kraglin and dozens of Ravager ships attend, acknowledging Yondu's sacrifice and accepting him as a Ravager again. During the funeral, Gamora admits she loves Peter, and they become a couple.\nIn a series of mid-and post-credit scenes , Kraglin takes up Yondu's telekinetic arrow and control-fin; Ravager leader Stakar Ogord reunites with his ex-teammates; Ayesha creates Adam, a new artificial being with whom she plans to destroy the Guardians; [a] Groot grows into a teenager; [b] and a group of uninterested Watchers abandon their informant, who is discussing his experiences on Earth.\n- Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord :\nThe half-human, half- Celestial leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy who was abducted from Earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers . [8] [9] Pratt, who returns as part of a multi-film contract with Marvel, [10] said Quill is now famous throughout \"the galaxy for having saved so many people... He feels like he's part of this group, a leader of this group. He's a little more responsible and trying to stay out of trouble, but not necessarily doing the best job.\" [11] Pratt stated that working on the film forced him to come to terms with the death of his own father. [12] Wyatt Oleff once again portrays a young Quill. [13]\n- Zoe Saldaña as Gamora :\nA member of the Guardians and an orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes. She was trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin. [9] Saldaña described Gamora's role in the team as \"the voice of reason\", saying, \"She's surrounded by all these dudes who are so stupid half the time,\" [14] and added that she is the \"Mom\" of the team, saying that she is \"just a meticulous, detailed, professional individual.\" [15] Regarding Gamora's relationship with Nebula, Saldaña described it as \"volatile\" and added, \"we're starting somewhere very crazy but appropriate given where we had ended things off in the first installment\". [16]\n- Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer :\nA member of the Guardians and highly skilled warrior. [9] Bautista waited for the final version of the script to not take \"away from the magic\", which he felt had happened when he read early drafts of the first film. [17] He added that \"I wasn't crazy about my part [in Vol. 2 , initially]. It went a different direction than what I thought they were going to go with Drax,\" noting he did not \"think Drax was that significant in the film\". The part \"clicked\" for Bautista after the table read with the other cast. [18] Bautista called Drax \"more funny, driven\" than in the first film, [19] and having \"a sense of innocence and heartbreak about him\", [14] despite \"most people's first perception of Drax [that] he's just a big, muscly brute\". [19] Bautista's makeup took only 90 minutes to apply, down from four hours for the first film. He would have to sit in a sauna at the end of the day to get the makeup off, after his makeup test was found to be too \"abrasive\". [15]\n- Vin Diesel as Baby Groot :\nA member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid and the accomplice of Rocket. [20] The character began growing from a sapling at the end of the first film, with James Gunn intending for him to be fully grown by the sequel. Gunn eventually decided to keep him as \"Baby Groot\", which was one of the reasons the film is set only a few months after the first. [21] Gunn described Baby Groot as the son of Groot from the first film, [22] with Diesel explaining that \"we're going to see this goofy, adorable, baby Groot [just] kinda learning as he goes.\" [23] [24] Prop master Russell Bobbitt created a 1:1 scale model of the 10-inch (25 cm) Baby Groot for filming, to use as a lighting reference and sometimes as a puppet for the actors to interact with. [25] As Groot only communicates with the phrase \"I am Groot\" in different inflections, Gunn created a \"Groot Version\" of the script for himself and Diesel, which contains each of Groot's lines in English. [26] Diesel used a higher register of his voice for Baby Groot, which was pitched up by seven to nine semitones depending on the take. He also delivered lines slowly to avoid any time stretching issues. [27] Diesel recorded Groot's voice for sixteen foreign-language releases of the film (up from six in the first film). [28] Sean Gunn provided on-set reference for adolescent Groot in the post-credit sequence. [29]\n- Bradley Cooper as Rocket :\nA member of the Guardians who is a genetically-engineered raccoon -based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics. [9] Sean Gunn once again served as the stand-in for the character during filming, [30] with Cooper's performance also referenced. [29] Sean Gunn said that \"Rocket has the same sort of crisis of faith [that he had in the first film] about whether or not he belongs in this family\", [31] with James Gunn adding, \"this is really about Rocket coming to terms with accepting his place within a group of people, which probably seemed like a good idea\" when they were heroes together at the end of the first film, but now \"he's just not very comfortable with the idea\". Feige stated that the relationship between Rocket and Groot has changed, saying, \"Groot was Rocket's protector in the first movie, [and now] Rocket is Groot's protector.\" [15]\n- Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta :\nA blue-skinned buccaneer of the Ravagers who is a fatherly figure to Quill and member of the Guardians. He is also the former deputy to Ayesha. [32] [33] Yondu has a larger head fin in the film, to look closer to his comic counterpart, [34] and Rooker worked with the prosthetic department to add gaps to his prosthetic teeth, \"just like real teeth\", to aid him in whistling as the character. [35] Rooker explained that, for the sequel, Gunn \"wanted people to experience more in-depth what Yondu was thinking and how he's feeling—a more serious Yondu.\" Rooker noted the complex relationship between Yondu and Quill where \"we don't agree on things...they are constantly at each other's throats [but] Yondu truly cares about this kid.\" [36] Gunn was reluctant to kill Yondu in the film, but ultimately felt that \"this is a story about a father's love for his son, his ultimate love, so much love that he sacrifices himself for that, and that's what Yondu is. He is 100 percent Peter Quill's father\" despite Ego being Quill's biological father. [37] Before the release of Vol. 2 , Rooker spent time on the set of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) to counteract rumors that the reason his character would not appear in that film was that he would die in this one. [38]\n- Karen Gillan as Nebula :\nAn adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as sisters and a former enemy of the Guardians. [16] Gillan stated the film would further explore the sisterly relationship between Nebula and Gamora, [39] including their backstory \"and what happened to these two girls growing up and actually how awful it was for them and how it has ruined their relationship\", [15] adding \"we're [also] going to start to see how much pain [Thanos] actually caused [Nebula]... we really start to see the emotional crack in her character\". [40] While Gillan had to shave her head for the first film, she only had to shave half of her head for the sequel, taking away the underneath part and leaving the top. [40] Gillan's makeup took two and a half hours to apply, down from five hours for the first film. [25]\n- Pom Klementieff as Mantis :\nA mantis-like creature and member of the Guardians with empathic powers who lives with Ego. [15] [41] Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said the character \"has never really experienced social interaction\", and learns about \"social intricacies\" from the other Guardians. [42] Klementieff added, \"She was really lonely and by herself, so it's a completely new thing to meet these people and to discover new things\", comparing this to a child making awkward mistakes in social situations. Mantis and Drax have an \"interesting\" relationship in the film due to both being \"complete odd balls\". [15] Steve Englehart , Mantis' co-creator, was disappointed with the character's portrayal, saying, \"That character has nothing to do with Mantis ... I really don't know why you would take a character who is as distinctive as Mantis is and do a completely different character and still call her Mantis.\" [43]\n- Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord :\nA high-ranking Ravager who holds a grudge against Yondu. [44] Stallone likened his character's relationship with Yondu to a father-son relationship, and called the confrontation they have in the film \"pretty intense\". [36] For Stakar's acceptance of Yondu as a Ravager at the end of the film, Gunn asked Stallone to channel the \"That'll do, pig\" line from the film Babe . [45] Gunn described Stakar as \"very important to the Marvel Universe\", [46] and said that \"it's our plan to see more of Stallone\" in future MCU films, though he was not sure then if that would include Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023). [47]\n- Kurt Russell as Ego :\nAn ancient Celestial who is Quill's father. [34] [48] Pratt was the first to suggest to Gunn that he consider Russell for the role; he portrays an avatar of Ego who is more traditionally seen in the comics in his \"Living Planet\" form. [49] Russell appreciated why he was wanted for the role after seeing Pratt's performance in the first film, feeling \"That's my kinda guy. I know where that kind of goof comes from.\" He added, \"I bring the right things [from previous roles]...I connected the dots from some of the things I've done in the past.\" [50] Ego replaces Quill's original comic father of J'son , [51] and was allowed to be used in the film after 20th Century Fox reached a deal with Marvel Studios to return the film rights of Ego for changing the power set of Negasonic Teenage Warhead , whom Fox wanted to use in Deadpool (2016). [52] Gunn originally thought Marvel held the rights to the character, and stated that, had the deal with Fox not been made, there was \"no back up plan, and it would [have been] nearly impossible to just drop another character in,\" given the extensive work done surrounding the character. [53] For the film's opening sequence, set in 1980 Missouri, Aaron Schwartz served as facial reference for the young Ego. [54] [55]\nElizabeth Debicki appears as Ayesha , the golden High Priestess and the leader of the Sovereign people, [48] [56] [57] a genetically engineered race who are \"gold and perfect and wanting to be physically and mentally impeccable\". Gunn was \"very specific\" when writing the character, and after casting director Sarah Finn suggested Debicki, Gunn \"knew right away that she was the one\". Gunn highlighted the actress' beauty and 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) height. Debicki wore platform shoes to increase her height to 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m). [36] Chris Sullivan portrays Taserface , the leader of a mutinous group of the Ravagers. [48] [57] Gunn originally posted a photo of the comic book character on his social media after landing Guardians of the Galaxy , calling him \"the dumbest character of all time\" and saying he would never feature the character in a film. After eventually deciding to use the character in the sequel, Gunn felt the character had given himself the name Taserface and is \"a real dumbass\". [58] Sullivan's makeup took two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours to apply each day. [59] Sean Gunn appears as Kraglin Obfonteri , Yondu's second-in-command in the Ravagers. [60] Kraglin has an expanded role compared to the previous film—Sean Gunn explained, \"In the first film he did a lot of just saying yes and being at Yondu's side, but in this movie things take a little bit of a different turn as Kraglin has a little bit of a crisis of conscience and has to decide whether he's going to stick with Yondu or join forces with the growing faction of mutineers.\" [36] [61]\nAdditionally, reprising their roles from the first film are Laura Haddock as Meredith Quill , Gregg Henry as her father, Seth Green as the voice of Howard the Duck , and canine actor Fred as Cosmo . [55] [62] [63] Members of Yondu's Ravager crew appearing in the film include Evan Jones as Retch, Jimmy Urine as Half-Nut, Stephen Blackehart as Brahl, [57] Steve Agee as Gef, [57] [64] Mike Escamilla as Scrote, [65] Joe Fria as Oblo, Terence Rosemore as Narblik, [57] and Tommy Flanagan as Tullk, [57] [66] [67] as well as Charred Walls of the Damned drummer and Howard Stern Show personality Richard Christy in a cameo appearance. [68] The other members of Stakar and Yondu's old team, based on the comic's original incarnation of the Guardians of the Galaxy , include Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex , Ving Rhames as Charlie-27 , and Michelle Yeoh as Aleta Ogord . [47] [63] Also included in the team are the CG characters Krugarr and Mainframe , with the latter voiced, in an uncredited cameo, by Miley Cyrus . [47] [69] Rosenbaum had previously auditioned to play Peter Quill in Vol. 1 . [70] Gunn cast Yeoh because of his love of 1990s Hong Kong films , [71] and Cyrus after admiring \"the tone of her voice\" while watching her as a coach on The Voice . [69] He added that the team would return in future MCU films alongside Stallone's Stakar. [47]\nStan Lee appears as an informant to the Watchers , discussing previous adventures that include his cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, which connects to Lee's cameo as a FedEx delivery man in Captain America: Civil War (2016). [72] This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, [73] with Gunn noting that \"people thought Stan Lee is a Watcher and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU.\" [72] [73] Feige added that Lee \"clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians ...really says, so wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?\" [74] Lee filmed several different versions of the scene, including an alternative where he references his role in Deadpool , which would have been the first acknowledgment of the X-Men film series by an MCU film. [73] Gunn later admitted that the Civil War reference is a continuity error , given Vol. 2 is set before the events of Civil War , saying, \"I screwed up; I wasn't thinking. But I'm going to say that probably Stan Lee used the guise of a FedEx guy more than one time.\" [72]\nDavid Hasselhoff makes a cameo appearance as himself, when Ego shape-shifts to his likeness, [13] while Rob Zombie once again has a Ravager voice cameo. [55] [75] Footage of Jeff Goldblum dancing as the Grandmaster from the set of Thor: Ragnarok (2017) is used briefly during the end credits, with Feige explaining that Marvel \"thought it would be fun to put it in there\" especially since the comic version of Grandmaster is the brother of the Collector , who appeared in the first Guardians film. [76] Ben Browder , the star of the series Farscape , of which Gunn is an avid fan, cameos as a Sovereign Admiral. [77] Molly Quinn appears as Howard the Duck's date. [13] Jim Gunn Sr. and Leota Gunn, parents of James and Sean Gunn, also make cameo appearances in the film as an elderly couple on Earth. [78] Jimmy Kimmel Live! ’s Guillermo Rodriguez has an uncredited cameo appearance as a police officer on Earth when the seedling was terraforming. [79] [80]\n\"There are general ideas for what the sequel is and where it goes and who's involved and what happens and what we find out about our characters. So it's very general and that could change ... but I know a lot about who these characters are and where they came from and where they're going. I'm excited by the possibility of creating a sequel because we had to do a lot of setup in [the first] movie and with a sequel we don't have to do that setup which will make it so much easier for me.\"\n—James Gunn, writer and director of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , on the state of the sequel in August 2014 [81]\nIn May 2014, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated he felt the first Guardians of the Galaxy film (2014) had \"strong franchise potential\". [82] He added that their goal was to create \"another Avengers (2012)\". [83] James Gunn , who directed and co-wrote the first film, said that he would like to return for a sequel, and that he was contractually obligated to if asked. [84] The next month, producer Kevin Feige said there are \"places we can take [the franchise] and we have ideas of where we'd like to go\" based on the wide array of characters, worlds and storylines from the comics. [85] In July 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman confirmed a sequel, saying it was \"going to happen\" due to the positive internal response to the first film at Disney, and that Gunn would write and direct. [86] [87] At San Diego Comic-Con International soon after, the sequel was given a release date of July 28, 2017. [88]\nGunn had begun work on the film within a month, and said it would include at least one new Guardian from the comics. [89] [90] In October, Gunn confirmed that all five original Guardians would return for the sequel, along with other supporting characters, [91] and the release date was moved up to May 5, 2017. [92] In the following months, Michael Rooker said he would return as Yondu Udonta , and was looking forward to exploring new areas of the character. [32] [93] Chris Pratt , who played Peter Quill/Star-Lord in the first film, confirmed the sequel would be one of his next projects. [8] Bradley Cooper expressed interest and excitement when asked if he would return as Rocket . [94] Vin Diesel also confirmed he would return as Groot . [20] In March 2015, Gunn revealed that filming would take place in Atlanta , Georgia with \"major crew changes\" from the first film, and that his brother, Sean Gunn , would return as Kraglin Obfonteri alongside Karen Gillan as Nebula . [60] [95] He explained his relationship with Marvel Studios , saying the company \"let me go and do my thing, and I truly listen to their notes and ideas. I've never been told to put in any character or plot element at all... When they trust you they give you a wide berth... we just fit\". [95]\nIn May, Gunn said the sequel would feature fewer characters than the first film, and that he had planned to introduce two major new characters in the script— Mantis and Adam Warlock . [5] [9] Talks had begun with an actor Gunn had in mind to portray Mantis, [96] while he had decided to remove Warlock due to the film \"getting too busy\", explaining, \"one of the main things with Guardians of the Galaxy is not to add a bunch of characters, not to make it bigger in that way but to go deeper with the characters... and getting to know them more emotionally... everything is just getting too sprawling and too crazy for me in these superhero comic book movies\". [9] Gunn added, \"I adored what we had done with him. I think we did something really creative and unique with Adam Warlock. But it was one character too many and I didn't want to lose Mantis and Mantis was more organically part of the movie anyway\". [5] He noted that Warlock could appear in future Guardians films, and is considered \"a pretty important part\" of the cosmic side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe . [5] [97] The character's future introduction is hinted at in one of the film's mid-credits scenes. [4] Gunn noted that Marvel gave him \"some blowback\" for including the Warlock teaser because they felt fans would believe the character would be appearing in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), which was not the case. By including the scene, Gunn promised Marvel he would use his social media presence to clarify for fans that the character would not be seen in either of the Avengers films. [98]\nAfter the film's announcement, Gunn said he knew \"a lot of where I want to go [in the sequel]\", [99] having written the backstory of Peter Quill, his father and his history with Yondu during the making of the first film with the intention of exploring them in a future film. [21] Gunn wanted to give the sequel a different structure from the first film, since \"one of the reasons people like Guardians is because it's fresh and different, so the second one will be fresh and different from the first one\". [100] Before starting on the script, Gunn hoped to further explore Drax , Nebula, Kraglin and the Collector , and expand on Xandarian , Kree , Krylorian and Ravager culture. [99] [101] He also hoped to introduce more female characters in the sequel, though wanted to avoid including \"earthlings\" such as Carol Danvers , [102] as well as Novas Richard Rider or Sam Alexander , saying, \"I think Quill being the only earthling is important. That serves the entire movie-going audience and not just the handful of Nova [and Carol Danvers] fans\". [103] The character Darkhawk had also been considered for the film. [104]\nFeige said exploring Quill's father \"would certainly be part of a next Guardians adventure\", adding \"I think there's a reason we seeded it at the very end of the [first] film like that\". [105] Gunn also stated that he wanted to make sure \"Yondu's place in everything made sense\" in regards to his relationship to Quill and his father, and also revealed Quill's father would not be J'son as in the comics. [51] Gunn \"was less confident [Marvel] was going to buy in on Baby Groot than\" including Ego, since \"adult Groot was the most popular character from the first film and I didn't think they'd want to risk a good thing\". However, by changing Groot, Gunn felt it \"opened the film up\" creatively, allowing Gunn to bring out \"new aspects of our other characters\". [106] Gunn said Thanos would only appear in the sequel \"if he helps our story and he will not show up at all if not. Thanos is not the most important thing in Guardians 2 , that's for damn sure. There's the Guardians themselves and other threats the Guardians are going to be facing that are not Thanos\". [51] Feige later confirmed that Thanos would not appear in the sequel, as he was being saved for a \"grander\" return. [107] [108] When asked about how the film would connect with the other Phase Three films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Gunn said, \"I don't feel beholden to that stuff at all. I think it's really about the Guardians and what they are doing\". [109]\nGunn set the film two to three months after the first film [97] [110] \"because he felt the group are just such fragile egos and he didn't think this story could start years later\". [97] Major planets visited in the film include Sovereign, Berhart and Contraxia. Feige also stated two or three other worlds would be seen, as well as \"a little bit of Earth in this film, but it's not these characters going to Earth\". [15] In December 2014, Gunn revealed the story for the film was written, saying, \"It's [still] constantly shifting, but I feel like it's pretty strong. I'm excited about it\". [111] By early February 2015, Gunn was \"a few short weeks\" away from submitting a full story treatment to Marvel, and said that when he first presented his idea for the sequel to the company they thought it was \"risky\". He described it as \"not really based on anything\" from the comics, being mainly an original story. [112] [113] Gunn later referred to the full treatment as a \"scriptment\", \"a 70-page combination of a script and a treatment and it goes through every beat of the movie\". [9] By April, he was preparing to write the screenplay, [112] and in May he was hoping to complete the script before he began work on The Belko Experiment (2016) in June 2015. [96]\nAs he developed the story, Gunn considered to have Gamora killed off due to Zoe Saldaña 's original expectations to only play the role in the first film. [114] As he knew that Saldaña didn't wish to play Gamora for a few years, Gunn considered to have Gamora sacrifice herself at the end of the film to save Peter so he could learn about himself, but Feige and Louis D'Esposito talked Gunn out from taking that decision because it didn't work well with the story, in addition to their plans to have Gamora die in Infinity War instead as the Russo brothers informed Gunn during months of planning Vol. 2 . Gunn ultimately concluded that the story naturally progressed in a way that insisted that Yondu Udonta should be the one to die at the end to rescue Quill despite Gunn's initial reluctance in killing off Michael Rooker's character due to their friendship, but in retrospective, Gunn felt that the story worked out in a perfect way to set up Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023). [115]\nOn June 2, 2015, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed the first draft of the screenplay, and that the film's title would not simply be Guardians of the Galaxy 2 . [116] The same week, he confirmed the return of Saldaña, Dave Bautista and Cooper as Gamora, Drax and Rocket, respectively. [9] At the end of the month, Gunn announced the film would be titled Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , [117] saying he \"came up with a LOT of titles for Vol. 2 . But because 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is already so wordy, it seemed strange to add another bunch of words after it. I liked Vol. 2 the best, so that's what I stuck on the cover of the screenplay—and, fortunately, [Marvel] liked it\". [118]\nIn September 2015, Gunn said in a Facebook post that he wanted to use Sneepers , an alien race that first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1964, as background characters in the film, but was advised against it by Marvel's legal department because the name was too similar to snípur , the Icelandic word for clitoris . [119] The Marvel legal department later cleared the use of Sneepers in the film, in part because of all the media coverage Gunn's initial post received. [120] At the end of the month, Feige stated casting announcements would be made before the end of 2015, [121] and by the end of October, Pom Klementieff was cast as Mantis. [41] [122] Also, it was reported that Matthew McConaughey had recently turned down the role of \"the villain\" in the film, [123] in favor of The Dark Tower (2017). McConaughey felt he would have been \"an amendment\" in Vol. 2 in \"a colorful part [made] for another big-name actor\". [124] In December, Gunn said that he was corresponding with John C. Reilly about him reprising his role as Nova Corpsman Rhomann Dey , [125] while Kurt Russell entered early talks to play Quill's father. [126] After the death of David Bowie in January 2016, Gunn said that there had been discussions for Bowie to appear in the film as a member of Yondu's original crew. [127] [128] Gunn also stated that he had completed the final draft of the script. [129] Benicio del Toro , who portrayed the Collector in the first film, expressed interest in portraying the character again, despite Marvel not contacting him about the sequel; [130] Gunn explained that the Collector \"just didn't fit\" into Vol. 2 . [131] In early February, comedian Steve Agee was revealed to be in the film. [64]\nProp master Russell Bobbitt had difficulty finding the cassette decks that had been used in the first film, and all of the Sony Walkman headsets they sourced for the sequel were broken. Sony also did not have any headsets available for filming, while three pairs Bobbitt found on eBay cost around $1,800 and were not the exact model. Bobbitt eventually created six from scratch for Vol. 2 . Other props he created for the film included two sets of blasters for Quill, with removable blaster cartridges, and \"steampunk-looking weapons and belts\" for the Ravagers; [25] Bobbitt explained that four different weapons were designed for the latter group, and then 15–20 versions of those were produced to be used by the various Ravager actors (there could be up to 85–95 Ravagers per scene). For their belts, the props team cut the leather themselves rather than buying existing belts, and then parts from different electronic devices such as radios and cell phones were glued together to make each belt \"a unique piece of art\". The prop department also made edible props for certain scenes: a prop of a stinkbug -inspired insect was made from chocolate and injected with black honey so it could be eaten on screen and \"when he bit down the honey poured out of his mouth\"; similarly, a \"yarrow root\" was designed based on enlarged images of pollen, and then created with non-dairy white chocolate to be eaten onscreen. [36]\nPre-shooting began on February 11, 2016, [132] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia , [133] under the working title Level Up , [97] with Henry Braham serving as cinematographer and Scott Chambliss as production designer . [9] [134] Gunn noted that many of the crew from the first film, such as cinematographer Ben Davis and production designer Charles Wood, signed on to work on Doctor Strange (2016), and due to a late change in production schedule for that film, were unable to work on Vol. 2 . [135] [136]\nPrincipal photography began on February 17, [48] with Marvel confirming that Russell had joined the cast, and revealing that Elizabeth Debicki and Chris Sullivan had also been cast, all in undisclosed roles. [48] The production used all 18 stages at Pinewood Atlanta Studios, an increase in stage space from what was used for the first film. Gunn said the sequel required more sets than the first and \"our sets are very large, even though a lot of the film is CGI. I like to have as many practical sets as we can and make the environments as real as possible so it balances out the CGI elements\". Despite this, Gunn noted that there were less locations featured in the sequel, with the focus instead on being more specific and detailed with fewer places shown. Sets constructed for the film included several for the Sovereign planet, for which Chambliss used a \"1950s pulp fiction variation on 1930s art deco design aesthetic\"; the Ravager's main ship in the film, the Eclector , which was constructed in sections to provide a complete 360-degree view of the ship as well as the ability to move sections around and portray different areas of the ship; and the Iron Lotus establishment on the \"pleasure planet\" of Contraxia, which Chambliss wanted to feel like it had been put together from \"a whole yard of repurposed junk where old spaceships are cast away and industrial materials that aren't of use anymore are just left to rot\", creating a \"kind of neon jungle in its own way and covered in ice and snow\". Interiors for other ships were also constructed, to limit the amount of blue screen the actors had to interact with; [36] this includes the cockpit of Quill's ship that had been built for the first film before being stored in London which was transported to Atlanta for the sequel. [137]\nVol. 2 was the first film to be shot with an 8K resolution camera, the Red Weapon 8K. [138] Braham had wanted to use a different camera than the Alexa 65 that had been used for several other Marvel films, because he found it to be a \"very big and heavy camera\". He wanted a camera that could deliver equivalent image quality to the Alexa 65, and tested multiple options. He eventually met with Red employees, whom he had a positive experience with working on The Legend of Tarzan (2016), and they introduced him to an early prototype for the Weapon 8K. He, Gunn, and Marvel decided to use the camera in September 2015, when only that single prototype existed, and spent three months working with Red to get the camera ready for filming. [137] For the sequence where Rocket and Yondu escape from the Ravagers, a Phantom Camera was used to film scenes up to 2,000 frames per second, with the footage able to be moved from slow-motion to high-speed within a single shot. Each shot using the camera had to be carefully set up and choreographed. [139] Additional scenes were also shot in IMAX and its aspect ratio. [97] Braham filmed almost 85 percent of the film using a stabilizing technology he had contributed to called Stabileye, which he called \"a handheld dolly \" which allowed \"a spontaneity to the way the camera moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie\". For filming the cockpits of spaceships, Braham surrounded the practical sets with video panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting no matter the environment outside the ship. Exteriors of the ships were filmed with the camera on a technocrane , but any shots inside the cockpits again used the Stabileye which is \"so small that you can get it in there next to the actors\". [137]\nIn April 2016, Gunn revealed that Reilly would not be part of the film, and stated that there were many other characters he could not include in the film due to rights issues, saying that 20th Century Fox \"owns so many awesome cosmic villains and minor characters that I'd love to play around with\" such as Annihilus and Kang the Conqueror . [131] Gunn also planned on filming scenes with Glenn Close , reprising her role as Nova Prime Irani Rael from the first film. [21] : 4 When filming Stan Lee's cameo, Gunn also filmed two other cameos with Lee including one for Doctor Strange , to limit the amount of travel Lee had to do. [78] [140] Additional filming for Vol. 2 took place in Cartersville, Georgia , [141] a state park north of Portland, Oregon , [29] and in St. Charles, Missouri . [142] The Georgia International Convention Center served as additional soundstage space after pre-production on Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) began at several Pinewood Atlanta Studios soundstages. [97] Principal photography wrapped on June 16, 2016. [143]\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2016, Russell and Debicki were revealed to be playing Ego, Quill's father, and Ayesha, respectively. [34] Sylvester Stallone was also revealed to be in the film, [34] with his role later revealed as Stakar Ogord . [44] Gunn also introduced multiple actors who were playing Ravager characters, since the Ravagers have a larger presence in the film. [57] On the decision to reveal Russell as Ego and Quill's father when he did, Gunn felt that since \"people were going to figure it out eventually [...] it was better that we took the reins in our own hands\" and make the reveal. Gunn also felt that this would move the focus of audiences from wanting to discover who Quill's father is to \"the story and the relationship that these characters have\". [144] In August 2016, Gunn confirmed the film would feature a post-credits scene , [110] later stating there would be five in total, with four mid-credits scenes and one post-credits. [145] [146] Gunn also planned a sixth scene, where the Ravager Gef is found \"mortally wounded\" on the ship, but \"it ended up being a little confusing\". [147]\nIn November, Gillan revealed that the film was undergoing reshoots. [148] That February, it was reported that the film had scored a perfect 100 in test screenings , the highest for any Marvel Studios film. The Hollywood Reporter noted this score could not necessarily be compared to any non-Marvel movies due to Marvel's specific testing process that selects its audience \"from a more select pool of recruits, what it terms 'friends and families screenings'\". [149] In March 2017, Gunn revealed that Michael Rosenbaum would appear in the film, [46] and that Gunn would provide reference for Baby Groot's dancing \"in a much bigger way [than the first film]. I actually had to do like a full day's worth of dancing to get Groot's dance down this time. Last time it was me in front of an iPhone , and this time it's me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different angles\". [150] Fred Raskin and Craig Wood returned from the first film to serve as editors. [48] On scenes that were cut from the film, Gunn said Nathan Fillion , who had had a voice cameo in the first film, was going to appear as Simon Williams in a sequence that would have shown several movie posters for films starring Williams, including films in which he portrays Arkon and Tony Stark . [151] [152] Gunn chose Williams for Fillion's cameo because he wanted Fillion to have a bigger role in the MCU at some point and so did not want to give him a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial one later. Gunn still considered Fillion's cameo canon to the MCU, despite it being cut. [153] He also confirmed that Close's scenes had been cut from the film, because it felt like he \"was trying to cram Nova Prime into the second movie as opposed to having it happen organically\". [78]\nVisual effects for the film were created by Framestore , Weta Digital , Trixter, Method Studios , Animal Logic , Scanline VFX , Lola VFX, Luma, and Cantina Creative . [154] Previsualization was done by The Third Floor. [155] Framestore created 620 shots for the film, Weta Digital created 530, Method Studios more than 500, and Animal Logic created 147. [29] Framestore once again created Rocket and Groot, [29] [156] with Method Studios, Weta Digital and Trixter also working on Rocket. Framestore rebuilt Rocket \"from the ground up\" for Vol. 2 , giving him an updated fur simulation, new facial shapes and phonemes, as well as a new eye rig, which came from a rig used for the character Gnarlack from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016). [29] Trixter's work on Rocket included when he sets off a trap for the Ravagers, additionally working on the sequence when Rocket, Yondu and Kraglin jump across space. [29] Other work from Framestore included creatures, spaceships, [29] Ayesha's lair, the space chase, the Eclector scenes, and the adolescent Groot post-credit scene. [157]\nFramestore also created the film's opening sequence. [29] Despite appearing as a single shot, it ultimately was composed of 11 different visual effect shots. Gunn provided reference video for Baby Groot's dancing in the sequence. [155] Framestore animation supervisor Arslan Elver noted that the majority of the opening sequence includes CGI and digital doubles, with three moments (Quill falling on the ground near Baby Groot, Gamora talking to Baby Groot, and Drax rolling behind Baby Groot) consisting of actual photography. [157] As with the first film, Sarofsky created the typography for the opening, using the same style from Guardians of the Galaxy for consistency, \"this time in rusty gold and glowing blue neon\". Executive Creative Director Erin Sarofsky noted the challenge of placing the credits while the sequence was being refined by Framestore. Sarofsky proposed several different options for the credits, including having \"a little hovering character that projected a hologram up on the screen\", but Gunn did not want another character in the sequence to deal with. A simpler 2D option was used instead. Sarofsky also worked on the end credits, the first time for the company, integrating the actual credits from company Exceptional Minds with designs inspired by old music album art, taking albums and scanning them for their old textures and scratches. [157]\nThe destruction of the Ravager ship the Eclector was handled by Weta Digital. [158] Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta also needed to create a digital double for David Hasselhoff for the moment when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff's guise. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We tried morphing to a live-action Hoff—but it did not hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version ... and while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double ... we didn't want to go to the same level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt digi-double in the first place was to make sure all the effects stuck correctly to the body ... so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we got pretty close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt\". [159] Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego's planet, known as the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the fractal art of Hal Tenny, who Gunn hired to help design Ego's environment. [156] [160] Gunn added that there are \"over a trillion polygons on Ego's planet,\" calling it \"the biggest visual effect of all time. There's nothing even close to it\". [160]\nAnimal Logic and Method Studios also worked on the various parts of Ego's planet, with Animal Logic focusing on Ego's cathedral, and Method on the arrival sequence and Baby Groot's \"not that button\" sequence in the Planet Hollow. Animal Logic's work for Ego's cathedral was also based on fractal art. The team at Animal Logic were initially brought on to the film to work on the story vignettes that were used to explain the backstory, which started as oil paintings before evolving to falling sand, and eventually the final plastic sculptures that were used. Method also created the film's final sequence for Yondu's funeral. To make Rocket shedding a tear convincing, Method used in-house footage of Animation Supervisor Keith Roberts \"performing the scene for reference, studying the macro facial movements like minor eye darts or blinks, in addition to what was filmed on set and in the sound booth by\" Cooper. Additional work included the scenes on the planet Berhart. [29] Lola VFX worked on de-aging Russell, having previously done similar work in other MCU films; they also added to various characters, including Nebula. To achieve the younger Ego, Lola referenced Russell's performance in Used Cars (1980), as \"he had a lot of the [facial] action\" the visual effects artists were looking for. They also used a younger stand in, Aaron Schwartz , since he had \"big broad jaw, chin, and most importantly the way the laugh lines move[d] and crease[d] as he talk[ed]\", similar to Russell's. [159] Laura Haddock , reprising her role from the first film of Meredith Quill in the sequence, was also slightly de-aged to play the younger version of that character. [142] Luma worked on the Sovereign people and their world, and Adam Warlock's cocoon. [29]\nBy August 2014, Gunn had \"some ideas listed, but nothing for sure\" in terms of songs to include in Quill's Awesome Mix Vol. 2 mixtape, [100] for which he felt \"a little pressure\" due to the positive response to the first film's soundtrack . Gunn added, \"But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better.\" [161] By June 2015, Gunn had chosen all of the songs and built them into the script, [9] calling Awesome Mix Vol. 2 \"more diverse\" than the first one, with \"some really incredibly famous songs and then some songs that people have never heard.\" [162] Tyler Bates was confirmed to score the film by August 2015, returning from the first film. [163] As with Guardians of the Galaxy , Bates wrote some of the score first so Gunn could film to the music, as opposed to Bates scoring to the film. [125] Recording for the score occurred in January 2017 at Abbey Road Studios . [164] Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Awesome Mix Volume 2 , along with the film score album composed by Bates, were released on April 21, 2017. [165] [166] A cassette version of Awesome Mix Volume 2 was released on June 23, 2017, while a deluxe-edition vinyl LP featuring both Awesome Mix Volume 2 and Bates' score was released on August 11, 2017. [167]\nIn June 2016, Marvel announced plans for an expanded merchandising program for the sequel, with Groot playing a central role. [168] Gunn ensured the film's female characters received more representation in the merchandise than in the first. [169] Paul Gitter, senior vice president of licensing at Disney Consumer Products , said they intended to build Guardians of the Galaxy into a tentpole franchise. Partners in the campaign included Hasbro , Lego , Funko , LB Kids , [168] GEICO , Ford Motor Company , Go-Gurt , Hanes , Synchrony Bank , Dairy Queen , M&M's , Screenvision , Sprint Corporation , and Wrigley Company . [170] Additionally, Marvel partnered with Doritos for their Rock Out Loud campaign to create a custom \"limited-edition series of Doritos bags featuring a built-in cassette tape deck-inspired player that plays\" Awesome Mix Vol. 2 and can be recharged. The custom bags were available to purchase on Amazon.com , with Doritos also hosting Rock Out Loud pop-up recording booths in New York and Los Angeles where fans could sing the songs from Awesome Mix Vol. 2 and have the opportunity to win various prizes, including the custom bags, concert tickets, and free bags of Doritos.\" [171]\nIn July 2016, Gunn, Pratt and other members of the cast attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film, [172] showing footage and revealing additional character information. [34] On October 19, a \"sneak peek\" teaser was released ahead of the first full teaser trailer. Ethan Anderton of /Film felt the teaser was strong, despite not showing any of the new characters or relying on Baby Groot, [173] while The A.V. Club ' s Esther Zuckerman called it \"an immediate crowd-pleaser\". [174] According to media-measurement firm Comscore and its PreAct service, the teaser was the top trailer for the week it released, generating 108,000 new social media conversations. [175] In early December, before Gunn revealed the first teaser trailer at Comic Con Experience 2016, [176] [177] he said that finding scenes and moments to showcase in the trailer without revealing too much of the film resulted in hard choices, since \"people really go through every single little shot and try to figure out what the movie's about. And there's a lot of mysteries in Guardians 2 .\" [178] Describing the teaser trailer, Jacob Hall of /Film noted that the trailer was able to succeed without giving too much away as it focused on character interactions rather than plot. [179] The teaser trailer received 81 million views in 24 hours, becoming the second-most viewed teaser behind Beauty and the Beast and largest Marvel Studios teaser ever. Additionally, Sweet's \"Fox on the Run\" reached number one on the iTunes Rock Chart after featuring in the teaser. [180]\nA second trailer aired during Super Bowl LI . Germain Lussier for io9 called it \"hilarious\", [181] while Anderton said it was \"one hell of a\" Super Bowl spot, \"one that probably overshadows the game itself for people like me... There's plenty of badass cosmic action, the humor we all love, a stellar soundtrack, and some great new footage from the sequel.\" [182] The spot generated the most Twitter conversation volume during the game with 47,800 conversations, according to Comscore, who measured the volume of trailers that aired during the game from the time it aired through the end of the game. The film also topped a Fandango survey of fans' favorite film trailer during the Super Bowl. [183] An additional trailer debuted on February 28, 2017, on Jimmy Kimmel Live! . Haleigh Foutch at Collider felt the trailer added \"hype\" to the film, and was \"just an all-around wonderful trailer, lit up with the wacky humor and irreverent charm that made the first film such a hit, with an extra dose of visual splendor.\" [184] Pratt and Saldaña appeared at the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards , where they debuted an exclusive clip. [185] In mid-July, Marvel created a 1980s-inspired infomercial and an 800 number to promote the film's home media release. [186]\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 made its world premiere in Tokyo on April 10, 2017, [187] and its Hollywood premiere on April 19 at the Dolby Theatre . [188] The film began its international release on April 25, in Australia, New Zealand, and Italy, [189] alongside a total of 37 markets in its first weekend, with 176 IMAX screens in 35 of those markets. [190] Its North American release on May 5 took place in 4,347 theaters, of which over 3,800 were in 3D, [191] 388 in IMAX and IMAX 3D , [191] [192] 588 premium large-format, and 194 D-Box locations. [191] The film's opening in China was in 400 IMAX theaters, the largest ever for the country. [193] On May 4, 2017, 550 theaters in the United States had a special RealD Guardians of the Galaxy double feature event before preview screenings of Vol. 2 . Guests who attended received an exclusive mini poster and a set of souvenir collectible buttons. [194] Vol. 2 was originally intended to be released on July 28, 2017. [88] The film is part of Phase Three of the MCU. [195]\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on August 8, 2017, and on Blu-ray , Blu-ray 3D, Ultra HD Blu-ray , and DVD on August 22. [196] [197] The Ultra HD Blu-ray version is the first Disney home media release in 4K resolution . [198] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and a music video for the song \"Guardians Inferno\". The digital release also exclusively features the breakdown of three scenes, from their initial ideas to their completed versions, and a behind-the-scenes look at the Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! , an accelerated drop tower dark ride attraction at Disney California Adventure . [196] The 1970s-style music video for \"Guardians Inferno\" was directed by David Yarovesky and features Hasselhoff alongside James Gunn, Pratt, Saldaña, Bautista, Klementieff, Gillan, Rooker, and Sean Gunn. Stan Lee and Guillermo Rodriguez also make cameo appearances in the video. [199] [200]\nThe digital release of the film had the most digital downloads and largest opening week of any Marvel Studios film. [201] The physical releases in its first week of sale were the top home media release, selling \"nearly three times as many discs as the rest of the top 10 sellers combined\", according to NPD VideoScan data. The Blu-ray version accounted for 83% of the sales, with 10% of total sales coming from the Ultra HD Blu-ray version. [202] In its second week, the film was once again the top home media release. [203] As well, total sales of Vol. 2 in the United Kingdom were more than the other films in the top 40 combined; it was also the top film in the country. [204] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021. [205]\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 grossed over $389.8 million in the United States and Canada, and over $473.9 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $863.8 million. [2] The film had earlier surpassed the first film's gross ($773 million) by Memorial Day weekend, three weeks after release, with $783.3 million worldwide, [206] and became the fifth-highest-grossing MCU film a week later. [207] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $154.7 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it ninth on their list of 2017's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\". [208]\nSince tickets went on sale on April 24, 2017, the film was the number one seller on Fandango , and surpassed the advance sales of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) in the similar time frame. [209] Over 80% of sales on MovieTickets.com were for the film ahead of its release. [191] Vol. 2 earned $146.5 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, [210] with IMAX contributing $13 million. [193] The $17 million that came from Thursday night previews was the highest preview amount of 2017. [191] The film had previously been projected to earn upwards of $160 million in its opening weekend, [194] [211] with Deadline Hollywood predicting it could reach the $179 million debut of Captain America: Civil War . [212] It remained at number one in its second weekend, [213] and fell to second in its third, behind Alien: Covenant . [214] Vol. 2 remained at number two in its fourth weekend, this time behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales , and crossed $337.6 million, surpassing the domestic gross of the first film. [215] By its fifth weekend, the film fell to fourth, [216] and in its next, fell to fifth. [217] Vol. 2 continued to remain in the top 10 for two more weeks, placing ninth in its seventh weekend, [218] and tenth in its eighth weekend. [219]\nOutside of the United States and Canada, the film earned $106 million in its first weekend from 37 markets, becoming the top film in them all except Portugal, Turkey, and Vietnam. IMAX contributed $5 million to the opening-weekend gross. The film also outperformed the original's opening weekend in all markets except Belgium. [190] In its second weekend, the sequel opened as the top film in South Korea, China, and Russia. [193] It had the highest opening for an MCU film in Austria, [190] the second-highest in Australia ($11.8 million), the Netherlands ($500,000), [189] [190] Germany ($9.3 million), and the United Kingdom ($16.9 million), [190] and the third-highest in New Zealand ($400,000), Italy ($1.4 million), [189] and Russia ($11.6 million). [193] The New Zealand and Netherlands openings were also the highest of 2017 for the countries, [189] while Germany and the United Kingdom's were the second-highest. [189] [190] In South Korea, it had the biggest opening day ($3.3 million) and second-best opening weekend ($13.3 million) of 2017, the latter surpassing the original's entire earnings in the country. It also had the biggest May opening day and the third-highest opening day for an MCU film there. [193] [220] Ukraine had the second-largest opening ever, while in Puerto Rico, the film had the largest IMAX opening. [193] More markets saw their gross for Vol. 2 surpass the total gross from the first film in its third weekend, [221] with China following in its fourth. [222] The next weekend saw Vol. 2 ' s gross outside the United States and Canada ($451.1 million) surpass the international gross of the first film ($440 million). [206] Vol. 2 ' s three biggest markets in total earnings were: China ($99.3 million), the United Kingdom ($51.3 million), and Germany ($28 million). [207]\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 85%, with an average score of 7.3/10, based on 426 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \" Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 's action-packed plot, dazzling visuals, and irreverent humor add up to a sequel that's almost as fun—if not quite as thrillingly fresh—as its predecessor.\" [223] On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". [224] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 93% overall positive score and a 77% \"definite recommend\". [191]\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety called the film \"an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle... and just obligatory enough to be too much of a good thing.\" He cautioned that \"this time you can sense just how hard [Gunn] is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard.\" [225] Writing for Rolling Stone , Peter Travers described the film as a \"blast\" and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that \" Vol. 2 can't match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessor...[but] the followup, while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn't lost its love for inspired lunacy. [226] Chicago Sun-Times ' Richard Roeper also gave the film three stars, calling it not \"quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original—but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch.\" Roeper continued that \"even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat\", and praised the cast, especially Rooker, with \"one of the best roles in the movie\". [227] In his review for RogerEbert.com , Brian Tallerico gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"a thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster\" that does not take itself seriously, avoiding \"many of the flaws of the first movie, and [doing] several things notably better. It's fun, clever and a great kick-off to the summer movie season.\" [228]\nAlso giving the film three out of four stars, Sara Stewart at the New York Post felt the film was overstuffed, but that Gunn's \"lighthearted approach makes this matter surprisingly little\" and \"at least it's stuffed with good cheer\". Praising the tone and 1980s references that gave the film a sense fun, Stewart called Vol. 2 an \"antidote to somber superheroes\". [229] At The Washington Post , Michael O'Sullivan gave the film four stars, praising it as being \"funnier, nuttier, and more touching\" than the first film. O'Sullivan felt it avoided usual sequel problems by building on the original film rather than repeating it, and also noted the use of music as well as \"dazzling\" visuals throughout, describing the film as \"a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all.\" [230] Brian Lowry, writing for CNN.com , criticized the middle portion of the film and its villain, but felt the film fared better than other Marvel sequels with its strong beginning and end, and \"good-natured energy\", saying it \"ultimately shares just enough with its central quintet—rather heroically getting the job done, even if the trip from here to there can be a bit disjointed and messy.\" [231] For The Atlantic , Christopher Orr felt the film did not live up to the original, particularly due to its heavier themes and feeling that Russell was \"badly miscast\", but the rest of the cast, soundtrack, and humor were enough for him to give an overall positive review. [232]\nAt The Hollywood Reporter , Todd McCarthy said \" Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.\" [233] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times was positive of the film's soundtrack and cast, especially Russell, but felt Gunn was trying too hard to re-capture the magic of the first film, and the increased scope of effects and action becomes weary. Turan concluded, \"There are enough reminders of the first Guardians to make the sequel an acceptable experience, [but it's] less like itself and more like a standard Marvel production.\" [234] Manohla Dargis at The New York Times said the film \"certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative.\" She also felt Gunn was trying too hard, and found many elements of the sequel to be too serious even with Russell balancing that with a much-needed \"unforced looseness\". [235] Anthony Lane in his review for The New Yorker felt once Ego was introduced, the film began to suffer from \"the curse of the backstory\" and that the \"point that the movie, which has been motoring along nicely, fuelled by silliness and pep, begins to splutter\" was when Ego's desire for larger meaning is revealed.

It’s a natural byproduct of the bacteria in your intestines doing their job and breaking down the fibers, sugars and starches in the food you eat. Though gas pain is usually nothing serious, the discomfort can be intense.\nIntestinal gas and its discomfort are likely to resolve on their own. Burping or passing gas through the rectum (flatulence) is usually enough to ease your physical discomfort.\nJohns Hopkins gastroenterologist Hazel Marie Galon Veloso provides some perspective on bloating and gas cramps, including when to see a doctor.\nYes, Veloso says. Anything that slows down the digestive process, such as a low-fiber diet, use of opioid medications or an anticholinergic drug can put the brakes on timely bowel function.\nVeloso says eating a diet rich in fiber, staying hydrated and exercising is a good long-term approach for beating bouts of gas and cramping. “If these measures don’t improve constipation and gas, a polyethylene glycol laxative can help,” she notes.\n“Since constipation causes gas and cramping, you should try to exercise regularly, stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet with plenty of fiber,” Veloso says.\nHere are some other tips:\n- Don’t drink with a straw.\n- Choose noncarbonated beverages.\n- Avoid chewing gum.\n- If your symptoms persist, see your doctor to rule out food sensitivities, and other conditions.\nVeloso says to be on the lookout for abdominal pain and bloating that persists even after constipation improves.\n“You may have celiac disease or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which can cause these symptoms and can occur with either constipation or diarrhea. You may also have irritable bowel syndrome or another problem,” she notes.\n“We see SIBO in patients who have had abdominal surgeries such as roux-en-Y gastric bypass or conditions such as diverticulosis of the small bowel. It’s more common in people with systemic diseases such as long-standing or poorly controlled diabetes, scleroderma, lupus, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, and those with a lowered immune system.\n“Long-term intake of narcotics or acid-suppressive medications such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole and esomeprazole can also cause SIBO. Advanced age can be another risk factor,” Veloso adds.\nThe condition can be treated with antibiotics, antimicrobial herbs or a low FODMAP diet . FODMAP stands for “fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols.”\nWhen it comes to recurring bouts of intestinal gas, food sensitivities such as lactose intolerance are another common culprit. Veloso says some food sensitivities are present at birth (primary); others can develop later on (secondary).\n“If you get repeated episodes of gas and cramping, try to notice foods that tend to set it off,” Veloso advises.\nOnce you identify the food(s) that cause problems, check in with your doctor, who can help determine if you’re reacting to lactose, fructose, gluten or another ingredient. Modifying your diet, taking enzyme pills or other treatments may bring relief.\nFor women, if your doctor rules out a digestive problem, a visit to the gynecologist may be in order. Bloating and abdominal pain can mean something going on with your uterus, ovaries or fallopian tubes.\nThere are many causes of bloating and gas pain, and most have treatments that can help you get relief. Any abdominal pain that’s severe or interferes with your life is a good reason to go with your gut and see a doctor."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The French song sung in Madagascar 3 is \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\" by Edith Piaf.", "reference_documents": ["From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\" Non, je ne regrette rien \" ( French pronunciation: [nɔ̃ ʒə nə ʁəɡʁɛtə ʁjɛ̃] 'No, I do not regret anything') is a French song composed in 1956 by Charles Dumont , with lyrics by Michel Vaucaire . Édith Piaf 's 1960 recording spent seven weeks atop the French Singles & Airplay Reviews chart. [1]\nThe song's composer, Charles Dumont , states in the book Édith Piaf, Opinions publiques , by Bernard Marchois (TF1 Editions 1995), that Michel Vaucaire's original title was \"Non, je ne trouverai rien\" (No, I will not find anything) and that the song was meant for the French singer Rosalie Dubois . However, thinking of Piaf, he changed the title to \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (No, I Regret Nothing).\nAccording to journalist Jean Noli, in his book Édith (Éditions Stock 1973), when Dumont and Vaucaire visited Piaf's home at Boulevard Lannes in Paris, on 24 October 1960, she received them in a very impolite and unfriendly manner. Dumont had tried to offer Piaf his compositions on several occasions, but she disliked them and had refused them. On that day she was furious that her housekeeper Danielle had arranged a meeting with the two men without informing her, so she let them wait an hour in her living room before she appeared. She told them she would listen to one song only. Dumont sang Non, je ne regrette rien , to which Piaf reacted extremely positively, saying \"This is the song I have been waiting for. It will be my biggest success! I want it for my coming performance at L'Olympia!\"\nPiaf dedicated her recording of the song to the Foreign Legion . [2] At the time of the recording, France was engaged in a military conflict, the Algerian War (1954–1962), and the 1st REP ( 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment )—which backed the failed 1961 putsch against president Charles de Gaulle and the civilian leadership of Algeria—adopted the song when their resistance was broken. The leadership of the Regiment was arrested and tried but the non-commissioned officers, corporals and Legionnaires were assigned to other Foreign Legion formations. They left the barracks singing the song, which has now become part of the Foreign Legion heritage and is sung when they are on parade.\nThe song begins, Non, rien de rien / Non, je ne regrette rien (\"No, nothing at all / No, I regret nothing\"). It goes on to describe how the singer has swept away all of his/her past and cares nothing for it, ending Car ma vie, car mes joies / Aujourd'hui, ça commence avec toi (\"For my life, for my joys / Today, it starts with you\").\nThe song has been recorded by other performers, including:\n- Piaf herself recorded an English version, titled No Regrets .\n- Shirley Bassey in 1965, (reaching No. 39 on the UK charts) and on the album Love Songs .\n- Karen Akers on her 1981 album \"Presenting Karen Akers\".\n- German singer Martinique released a Disco/Synth-Pop version \"No Regrets (Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien)\" in 1984\n- Bad Boys Blue in 1989, on album \" The Fifth \" recorded an English version titled No Regrets .\n- The rock band Half Man Half Biscuit recorded a 1991 English version titled No Regrets .\n- Emmylou Harris contributed an English version to the 1994 multi-artist \"Tribute to Edith Piaf\" album.\n- Elaine Paige on 1994 album Piaf , released to coincide with her portrayal of the lead character in the play of the same name.\n- Brazilian singer Cássia Eller in 2001 Acústico MTV album.\n- Vicky Leandros on her 2010 album \"Zeitlos\" (Timeless) sung in German with the title \"Nein, ich bereue nichts\" .\n- Cajun band Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys on their 2011 album Grand Isle .\n- Frances McDormand as Captain DuBois sings the song in Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted .\n- Raquel Bitton sang \"No Regrets\" in the film \"Piaf..Her story..Her songs\" and CD \"Raquel Bitton sings Edith Piaf\"\n- \"Nej, jag ångrar ingenting\" (Swedish) by Anita Lindblom in 1961\n- \"Ne oplakujem\" (Croatian) by Tereza Kesovija in 1962\n- \"Ne oplakujem\" (Croatian) by Ana Štefok in 1964\n- \"Ne, ne žalim ni za čim\" (Serbian) by Lola Novaković in 1964\n- \"Nej, jag ångrar ingenting\" (Swedish) by Gun Sjöberg in 1966\n- \"Nelituj\" (Czech) by Světlana Nálepková in 2005\n- \"Ne, ni mi žal\" (Slovenian) by Aleš Polajnar in 2014\n- \"No dico no\" (Italian) by Dalida\n- \"No me puedo quejar\" (Spanish) by Dalida\n- \"Nah de Nah\" (Spanish) by Javiera Mena\n- \"Nem, nem bánok semmit sem\" (Hungarian) by Vári Éva\n- Elvina Makarian (Armenian Legendary Jazz Singer).\n- In the United Kingdom, the song was at one time associated with the former Conservative politician Norman Lamont , former Chancellor of the Exchequer , who quoted the song's title to sum up his political career.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The Bantu Education Act was introduced in South Africa in 1953.", "reference_documents": ["Bantu Education Act , South African law , enacted in 1953 and in effect from January 1, 1954, that governed the education of Black South African (called Bantu by the country’s government) children. It was part of the government’s system of apartheid , which sanctioned racial segregation and discrimination against nonwhites in the country.\nFrom about the 1930s the vast majority of schools serving Black students in South Africa were run by missions and often operated with state aid. Most children, however, did not attend these schools. In 1949 the government appointed a commission, headed by anthropologist W.W.M. Eiselen, to study and make recommendations for the education of native South Africans. The Eiselen Commission Report (1951) urged the government to take charge of education for Black South Africans in order to make it part of a general socioeconomic plan for the country. In addition, the report stated that the schooling should be tailored toward the needs and values of the cultures of the communities in which the schools were located. The prescriptions of the commission were generally followed by the Bantu Education Act.\nUnder the act, the Department of Native Affairs, headed by Hendrik Verwoerd , was made responsible for the education of Black South Africans; in 1958 the Department of Bantu Education was established. The act required Black children to attend the government schools. Teaching was to take place in the students’ native tongue, though the syllabus included classes in English and Afrikaans . Instruction was mandated in needlework (for girls), handcraft, planting, and soil conservation as well as in arithmetic , social studies, and Christian religion. The education was aimed at training the children for the manual labour and menial jobs that the government deemed suitable for those of their race, and it was explicitly intended to inculcate the idea that Black people were to accept being subservient to white South Africans. Funding for the schools was to come from taxes paid by the communities that they served, so Black schools received only a small fraction of the amount of money that was available to their white counterparts. As a result, there was a profound shortage of qualified teachers, and teacher-student ratios ranged from 40–1 to 60–1. An attempt by activists to establish alternative schools (called cultural clubs because such schools were illegal under the education act) that would give children a better education had collapsed by the end of the 1950s.\nHigh schools were initially concentrated in the Bantustans , reserves that the government intended as homelands for Black South Africans. However, during the 1970s the need for better-trained Black workers resulted in the opening of high schools in Soweto , outside Johannesburg . Nonwhite students were barred from attending open universities by the Extension of University Education Act (1959). The Bantu Education Act was replaced by the Education and Training Act of 1979. Mandatory segregation in education ended with the passage of the South African Schools Act in 1996, but decades of substandard education and barriers to entrance to historically white schools had left the majority of Black South Africans far behind in educational achievement by the beginning of the 21st century.\nWritten and fact-checked by The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\nLast Updated: • Article History\na beach in apartheid-era South Africa\nWhat is apartheid?\nWhen did apartheid start?\nHow did apartheid end?\nWhat is the apartheid era in South African history?\napartheid , (Afrikaans: “apartness”) policy that governed relations between South Africa ’s white minority and nonwhite majority for much of the latter half of the 20th century, sanctioning racial segregation and political and economic discrimination against nonwhites. Although the legislation that formed the foundation of apartheid had been repealed by the early 1990s, the social and economic repercussions of the discriminatory policy persisted into the 21st century.\nRacial segregation , sanctioned by law, was widely practiced in South Africa before 1948. But when the National Party , led by Daniel F. Malan , gained office that year, it extended the policy and gave it the name apartheid . The implementation of apartheid, often called “separate development” since the 1960s, was made possible through the Population Registration Act of 1950, which classified all South Africans as either Bantu (all Black Africans), Coloured (those of mixed race), or white. A fourth category—Asian (Indian and Pakistani)—was later added. One of the other most significant acts in terms of forming the basis of the apartheid system was the Group Areas Act of 1950. It established residential and business sections in urban areas for each race, and members of other races were barred from living, operating businesses, or owning land in them—which led to thousands of Coloureds, Blacks, and Indians being removed from areas classified for white occupation. In practice, this act and two others in 1954 and 1955, which became known collectively as the Land Acts , completed a process that had begun with similar Land Acts adopted in 1913 and 1936: the end result was to set aside more than 80 percent of South Africa’s land for the white minority. To help enforce the segregation of the races and prevent Blacks from encroaching on white areas, the government strengthened the existing “pass” laws , which required nonwhites to carry documents authorizing their presence in restricted areas.\nOther acts also led to physical separation of the races. Under the Bantu Authorities Act of 1951, the government reestablished tribal organizations for Black Africans, and the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act of 1959 created 8 (later expanded to 10 )African homelands, or Bantustans . The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970 made every Black South African, irrespective of actual residence, a citizen of one of the Bantustans, which were organized on the basis of ethnic and linguistic groupings defined by white ethnographers. Blacks were stripped of their South African citizenship and thereby excluded from the South African body politic . The South African government manipulated homeland politics so that compliant chiefs controlled the administrations of most of those territories. Four of the Bantustans— Transkei , Bophuthatswana , Venda , and Ciskei —were later granted independence as republics, though none was ever recognized by a foreign government, and the remaining Bantustans had varying degrees of self-government. Regardless of their independence or self-governing status, all the Bantustans remained dependent, both politically and economically, on South Africa. The dependence of the South African economy on nonwhite labour, though, made it difficult for the government to carry out this policy of separate development.\nSeparate educational standards were established for nonwhites. The Bantu Education Act (1953) provided for the creation of state-run schools, which Black children were required to attend, with the goal of training the children for the manual labour and menial jobs that the government deemed suitable for those of their race. The Extension of University Education Act (1959) largely prohibited established universities from accepting nonwhite students. The government created new ethnic university colleges—one each for Coloureds, Indians, and Zulus and one for Sotho , Tswana , and Venda students as well as a medical school for Blacks.\nOther laws were also passed to legalize and institutionalize the apartheid system. The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act (1949) and the Immorality Amendment Act (1950) prohibited interracial marriage or sex. The Suppression of Communism Act (1950) defined communism and its aims broadly to include any opposition to the government and empowered the government to detain anyone it thought might further “communist” aims. The Indemnity Act (1961) made it legal for police officers to commit acts of violence, to torture , or to kill in the pursuit of official duties.\nThe policies dictating the physical and political separation of racial groups were referred to as “grand apartheid,” while the laws and regulations that segregated South Africans in daily activities were known as “petty apartheid”—for example, those that dictated which transportation, recreation, or dining options one could utilize based on race.\nInformation from your device can be used to personalize your ad experience.\nDo not sell or share my personal information.\nDo not sell or share my personal information."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh is the largest city on the banks of the Krishna River.", "reference_documents": ["- Last Updated : 17-Jan-2023\n- 16244 views\nIn Southern India, the Krishna River is an inter-state river. It is Peninsular India's second largest river, rising at an altitude of 1337 metres near Mahabaleshwar in Maharashtra State in the Western Ghats. It runs for about 1400 kilometres across the peninsula, from west to east, passing through Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. Ghataprabha, Malaprabha, Bhima, and Tungabhadra are the major Krishna tributaries.\nMORE ABOUT KRISHNA RIVER\nThe Krishna River is originated near Mahabaleswar, which is located near Jor village in Maharashtra. The Jor Village is located in the far northwestern part of the Wai Taluka. The river eventually empties into the Bay of Bengal at Hamasaladeevi in Andhra Pradesh, on India's eastern coast.\nThe river's delta is one of India's most productive areas. The prehistoric Ikshvaku and Satavahana sun kings reigned in this area as well. Wai is Maharashtra's oldest city, located on the Krishna River's banks in the Satara District. Sangli is the largest city on the banks of the river in Maharashtra, while Vijayawada is the largest city on the banks of the Krishna river in Andhra Pradesh.\nThe Krishna River is one of the most environmentally damaging rivers because it causes extensive land corrosion during the monsoon season . The river has rapids and is quite raging, reaching depths of more than 75 feet (23 metres) on several occasions. In Maharashtra's Marathi language, there is a proverb that says \"santh vaahate krishnamaai\" which means \"calmly runs Krishna\" This phrase is also used to describe how a person should be as calm as Krishna. Nevertheless, between June and August, the river's flow causes a significant amount of corrosion. Krishna brings productive soil to the delta area from Karnataka, Maharashtra, and the western part of Andhra Pradesh during this time.\nThe Tungabhadra River, which is the result of the union of two rivers - the Tunga River and the Bhadra River - is the river's most important tributary. The Western Ghat Mountain Ranges are the source of both of these rivers.\nFrom the right riverbanks, rivers like the Koyna, Venna, Panchganga, Vasna, Ghataprabha, Dudhganga, Tungabhadra, and Malaprabha meet Krishna. The Musi River, Yerla River, Bhima River, and Maneru Rivers all meet the river on the left bank at the same time.\nClose to Sangli, three tributaries join the Krishna River. Haripur, which is also close to Sangli, is where the Warana River joins the river. Sangameshwar is another name for this area. At Narsobawadi, near Sangli, the Panchganga River joins the Krishna River. These locations are revered as sacred. Lord Dattatraya is said to have spent part of his life on the riverbanks of this river at Audumber. Sangameswaram is a popular Hindu religious centre in Andhra Pradesh's Kurnool district. The Bhavanasi and Tungabhadra rivers meet in this area, and Krishna is born. The Srisailam reservoir has submerged the Sangameswaram Temple. Pilgrims only visit this area to see this temple during the summer, when the reservoir's water level drops.\nTRIBUTARIES OF KRISHNA RIVER\nThe Tungabhadra River, with a drainage basin of 71,417 km2 and a length of about 531 km, is the Krishna River's largest tributary, but the Bhima River, with a total length of 861 km and a drainage basin of 70,614 km2, is the longest.\nNear Sangli, three tributaries, the Panchganga, Warna, and Yerla, meet the Krishna river.\nKudalasangama (also spelled Kudala Sangama) is a small village in the Bagalkot district of Karnataka, about 15 kilometres from the Almatti Dam. Here, the Krishna and Malaprabha rivers meet. The Aikya Mantapa, or holy Samdhi of Basavanna, the founder of the Lingayat sect of Hindu religion, is located here, along with the Linga, which is said to be self-born (Swayambhu), and the river flows east towards Srisailam (another pilgrim centre) in Andhra Pradesh.\nSangameswaram, in Andhra Pradesh's Kurnool district, is a popular Hindu pilgrimage site where the Tungabhadra and Bhavanasi rivers meet the Krishna river.\nThe following are the major river's tributaries:\nAndhra Pradesh\n• Bhadra River\n• Varada River\n• Tunga River\n• Veda River\n• Avathi River\n• Bhavanasi River in Kurnool District\n• Suvarnamukhi River\n• Tungabhadra River\n• Vedavathi River\n• Paleru River\n• Musi River\n• Munneru River\n• Akeru River\nMaharashtra and Karnataka\n• Venna River\n• Varma River\n• Koyna River\n• Malaprabha River\n• Ghataprabha River\n• Bhama River\n• Pavna River\n• Kumandala River\n• Ghod River\n• Indrayani River\n• Kundali River\n• Man River\n• Bhogwati River\n• Moshi River\n• Bori River\n• Chandani River\n• Kamini River\n• Mula River\n• Mutha River\n• Nira River\n• Mula-Mutha River\n• Bhima River\n• Sina River\nKRISHNA BASIN\nThe Krishna Basin covers a total area of 258,948 km2, accounting for nearly 8% of the country's total land area. Karnataka (113,271 km2), Telangana, Andhra Pradesh (76,252 km2), and Maharashtra (76,252 km2) make up this large basin (69,425 km2).\nThe Krishna river rises in the Western Ghats at an elevation of about 1,337 metres, about 64 kilometres from the Arabian Sea, just north of Mahabaleshwar. It flows for about 1,400 kilometres before discharging into the Bay of Bengal. The Ghataprabha River, Malaprabha River, Bhima River, Tungabhadra River, and Musi River are the major tributaries that join Krishna.\nExcept for the western border, which is formed by an unbroken line of the Western Ghats, the majority of this basin consists of rolling and undulating country. Black soils, red soils, laterite and lateritic soils, alluvium, mixed soils, red and black soils, and saline and alkaline soils are all important soil types found in the basin.\nIn this basin, an average annual surface water potential of 78.1 km3 has been calculated. There is 58.0 km3 of water that can be used. The basin's cultivable area is approximately 203,000 km2, accounting for 10.4% of the country's total cultivable area. The Godavari River was linked to the Krishna River in 2015 by commissioning the Polavaram right bank canal with the help of the Pattiseema lift scheme to augment water availability to the Prakasam Barrage in Andhra Pradesh, as the Krishna river's water supply became insufficient to meet demand. Prakasam Barrage's irrigation canals are part of National Waterway 4. The Krishana-Godavari delta is known as India's \"Rice Granery of India.\"\nDAMS ON KRISHNA RIVER\nThe Krishna River has a number of dams, including the following:\n• Dhom Dam\n• Dhom Balakwadi\n• Almatti Dam\n• Basava Sagar Dam\n• Nagarjuna Sagar Dam\n• Srisailam Dam\n• Jurala Dam\n• Narayanpur Dam (downriver of Almatti Dam)\n• Prakasham Barrage\n• Pulichitnthala Dam is under construction.\n• Amar Dam\nPROTECTED AREAS\nThe rich flora and fauna can be found in a large area near the Krishna river. The Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary has been established to protect the last remaining mangrove forests in the Krishna estuary. A large number of resident and migratory birds call the sanctuary home. In the sanctuary, you can see fishing cats, otters, Estuarine crocodiles, spotted deer, sambar deer, blackbucks, snakes, lizards, and jackals. Plants like Rhizophora, Avicennia, and Aegiceros thrive in the sanctuary's lush vegetation. A few other wildlife sanctuaries in the Krishna basin are listed below.\n• Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve\n• Rollapadu Wildlife Sanctuary\n• Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary\n• Ghataprabha Bird Sanctuary\n• Gudavi Bird Sanctuary\n• Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary\n• Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary\n• Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary\n• Chandoli National Park\n• Kudremukh National Park\n• Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park\n• Mahavir Harina Vanasthali National Park\n• Mrugavani National Park\n• Pakhal Wildlife Sanctuary\n• Ranibennur Blackbuck Sanctuary"], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

Ferrante, in case you haven’t heard, has become an international phenomenon. She has acquired a certain notoriety not only because her writing is very intense, but also because no one outside a small handful of people has any idea who she is, or if she is a she. Her novels, whether in Italian or in English, are irresistible—less like sugar is irresistible, and more like pain is irresistible. What about these novels is irresistible is not so simple to say. Journalistic responses have tended to focus on something like the powerful reality of the characters and the impossibility of not identifying with them: “Elena is not destroyed” when she discovers her lover cheating on her, declares Roger Cohen, apparently with some relief, in The New York Review of Books . There has not been, though, much consideration about how exactly Ferrante’s writing makes those characters and their lives seem powerful. “Speed is one of the defining qualities of reading Ferrante,” observes Joanna Biggs in The London Review of Books , but without locating the accelerator. James Wood, whose New Yorker article spawned much of the Ferrante cult in the English-speaking world, is onto something when he notices, of the main character in I giorni dell’abandono that there “is a foul brilliance in how Ferrante sticks with the logic of Olga’s illogic.”\nBut how does Ferrante stick to illogical logic? How does her style create the irresistible? Here is a working hypothesis: Ferrante’s signature tic is the run-on sentence, a style more obvious in English translation than in Italian, run-ons are grammatically suspicious in English but normal in Italian. But even in Italian, Ferrante’s habit of running independent clauses together is distinctive. Here is a small example taken from the first page I flip to, from the last of the Neapolitan novels, Storia della bambina perduta : “Ma non mi convinceva, non gli credevo, esprimeva pareri entusiastici sul lavoro di troppe donne” (219). “But he didn’t convince me, I didn’t believe him, he expressed enthusiastic opinions about the work of too many women” (Ann Goldstein’s translation, which I’m quoting throughout). Ferrante deploys the run-on to create a momentum that is headlong and occasionally breathless but still intimate—here you are, inside the operation of Elena’s head, everything she thinks coming out in the order it occurs to her, she is a subtle thinker because she sees that someone praising the work of too many women, paradoxically, does not take women seriously, maybe even denigrates them, and suddenly there is not only personal introspection but also a history, a storia.\nAnd as a storia, the momentum is also manipulative. At least, it is the effect of a stylistic technique: this sentence is not Elena Greco speaking in a rush, slightly out of control, a real person thinking through something logically illogically. This is Elena Greco, or Elena Ferrante (who is the narrator here?), retrospectively recounting events and recreating the rush of the moment as part of her affectionate and yet also vindictive urge to represent Lila (the novels begin with Lila’s disappearance). Even as you are caught up in the momentum of Elena’s thoughts, you are also aware—this is one of the real pleasures of the books—that Elena the narrator is, usually, making fun of the naiveté or stupidity of Elena the character, or the silly slogan’s of an era (“we used such language” is a common refrain), or the ridiculous historical narratives that people regularly trot out. Ferrante, or Elena, pities, savors, or demolishes the intensity of the reactions by situating them in a much broader history. The four so-called Neapolitan novels depict an intense relationship between two women, but they also create an arc that amounts to a history of postwar Italy. The coordination of interior life and social life has been one of the oldest problems of the genre of the novel, and the run-on sentence is Ferrante’s technique for reworking it. “But he didn’t convince me, I didn’t believe him, he expressed enthusiastic opinions about the work of too many women”: the sentence registers Elena’s agitation, declares her growing suspicion of her lover Nino, displays her intelligence, catches both those reactions as part of a broader history from the emergence of feminism in Italy in the 1970s and its awkward, intimate relation with political shifts from Marxism to Socialism to Camorrists to the digital world, and so on. The retrospective narration performs a structural function throughout, though it never becomes entirely dominant because the run-on sentences won’t let it: the speed of the novels is an urge to know what will happen, the building of a forward historical and narrative momentum, but also an urge to watch an argument, already worked out, unfold. Elena’s relation to Nino, for instance, is not simply a personal train wreck that readers can or can’t identify with. The two characters are also—I’m not quite sure what else to call them—allegorical figures, alternately manifesting the relations between men and women, feminism and government, literature and politics, art and life: two abstract entities entangled in a perennial, but also curiously specific, battle.\nElena and Lila, the two brilliant friends, have a very intense relationship, but they also figure the difficulties of mimesis itself: Lila lives, Elena writes, presentation and representation, manifesting life in prose, worrying about whether one is eclipsing the other as writers have been doing since Plato and Aristotle. Because of the run-on sentences, because of the constant forward motion of the writing, Ferrante’s allegorical gestures never resolve into a simple message or political position or historical signifier, or a tedious novel about novels. Nor do they have a lot of faith in “reality” as a stable referent (the scene of the Naples earthquake is especially interesting in this respect). Ferrante’s run-on is not like a long Henry James sentence, which declares long before you get to the end of it that there is a brilliantly worked-out logic that you’d better slow down and grasp, and that what you will grasp at that moment is reality itself. Still, one thing that people including me like about the novels is that they somehow feel real. In Ferrante, you usually have very little idea what the apartments look like (rich with a view; poor with no bathroom), and very little idea what Elena and Lila look like (blond and plump; brunette and skinny). Elena periodically stresses she wants to look pretty, or changes her makeup to something more bourgeois, or mentions the model of a car or the location of a beach house, but that is about it. I think that the realism of the novel comes not from Flabuert-like detail but from the ability of a sentence to coordinate detail and history without quite resolving into either. So (an example Woods also points to) when the guests at Lina’s wedding realize “the wine wasn’t the same quality for all the tables,” Elena-the-character realizes in a flash that the “plebs were us.” But the speed of the narrative prevents this observation from turning into unfurled Marxist theory or interiority figured through enology. Ferrante’s run-on sentences are the mechanism for producing this reality effect. They deny, at the micro-level, any logical cohesion or narrative arc or life story, even as they are part of a retrospective narration whose end is never really in doubt. Elena, unsurprisingly, is not destroyed.\nIt sometimes seems as if she wishes she had been, though. The denial of logical cohesion, and the denial of historical narrative, often takes the form in Ferrante’s writing of a denunciation of art itself. There is throughout her novels a furious disavowal of “literature” as just “stories,” an anger and disgust that regularly nearly collapses into despair. Here is the last sentences of the last novel. “A differenza che nei racconti, la vita vera, quando è passata, si sporge non sulla chiarezza ma sull’oscurità. Ho pensato: ora che Lila si è fatta vedere così nitidamente, devo rassegnarmi a non vederla più” (451). “Unlike stories, real life, when it has passed, inclines toward obscurity, not clarity. I thought: now that Lila has let herself be seen so plainly, I must resign myself to not seeing her anymore.” Real life has no clear trajectory or boundaries, and the great weakness of stories is their urge toward making clear and sharp what is not. “Devo rassegnarmi” means, among other things, I must resign myself to the impossibility of literary presentation, the impossibility of manifesting a life in such a way that is not clarifying and simplifying: a journey to personal development, the unfolding of a thesis, some other stupid cliché. My novel, declares Ferrante, is at some level, as all literature is, a futile, misleading, failure. I do not think she is kidding.\nBut the obligation to resignation only happens in a non run-on sentence (“Unlike stories, real life, when it has passed, inclines toward obscurity, not clarity”). Grammatical perfection, so to speak, is the source of the despair. The last lines offer the moral the run-ons deny. There is no doubt about subject, verb, and object, and the result is a mini dissertation about the meaning of history in our time, a summing up of what Ferrante’s vision of an epic sweep through modern Italy amounts to: history no longer progresses, the idea of modernity as progress is foolish, the stories we have been telling ourselves are absurd, literature itself is absurd. The vitality of Lila and Elena and everything they embody, plainly seen for a moment, will not be seen again. You are closer to real life when you tend to obscurity, when, you are, quite literally, not in art or representation of any sort. All of which means: the final sentences, neatly grammatical, do the opposite of what they say. They clarify, and lose the life they say will be lost. They lose it by saying it will be lost.\nFerrante’s run-on sentences, on the other hand, do not manifest a thesis even as they constantly invoke one. They do not tend toward simple obscurity either—obscurity too is a thesis, as the final sentences clarify. Her run-on sentences do not offer a mini-narrative of historical progress, or a journey of personal development. Theirs is no allegorical formulation to be decisively deciphered. Instead, they offer a sense of going somewhere, of life being lived, happening and continuing to happen. History has not stopped in run-on sentences, they do not offer congratulations on the knowing rejection of past simplicities, they keep going, you don’t know where. Ferrante’s run-ons manifest life in on-going motion.\nThe run-on sentence offers a glimpse of how, or why, Ferrante is what everyone says she is: a great novelist. The compulsive attraction of these novels—I realize I am putting this too abstractly—lies in their ability to fashion a sense of a life with a future by rejecting, at a grammatical and formal level, two broad, contemporary dispositions at the same time: 1) old and current progressive historical narratives as silly stories (the Bildungsroman, feminist empowerment, the triumph of the proletariat, the management of liberal technocrats, the emancipatory digitization of life, and so on); but also 2) a pervasive, often theological resignation in contemporary life that “this is the way things are,” the bare life of a world catastrophe grounded in economic, ethnic, biological, environmental, racial, sexual, perhaps even national ontologies that we can do nothing about and that will never, ever change (Naples is often invoked as the allegorical representation of all these things). These two dispositions can be linked together—Jacques Rancière connects them when he argues that the “ethical turn” in art, and the war on terror in politics, both depend upon a “certain theology of time, the idea of modernity as a time destined to carry out an internal necessity, once glorious, now disastrous” (201). “The modernist rigour of an Adorno,” writes Rancière, “wanting to expurgate the emancipatory potential of art of any form of compromise with cultural commerce and aestheticized life, becomes the reduction of art to the ethical witnessing of unrepresentable catastrophe” (201). Ferrante’s run-on sentences, it seems to me, are responses to these political and artistic stakes. No other writer I can think of at the moment offers such a compelling grasp of, and maybe escape from, these two dominant trends, no other writer I can think of shows as effectively what misleading stories “progress” or “catastrophe” are (are they even different stories?). Run-on sentences generate a future, but they do not do so with an “internal necessity” that then goes wrong. \"Storia\" means both history and narration. But it is not the word she uses in the second-to-last sentence, which is “racconti—“accounts” or “tellings.” Ferrante’s run-on sentence avoids accounts by telling stories and histories that actually are going somewhere. Storia is the word Ferrante returns to for as the title for all the sections of the Neapolitan novels.

T.L.O. was made in 1985.", "reference_documents": ["No. 83-712\nArgued March 28, 1984\nReargued October 2, 1984\nDecided January 15, 1985\nCERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY\nSyllabus\nA teacher at a New Jersey high school, upon discovering respondent, then a 14-year-old freshman, and her companion smoking cigarettes in a school lavatory in violation of a school rule, took them to the Principal's office, where they met with the Assistant Vice Principal. When respondent, in response to the Assistant Vice Principal's questioning, denied that she had been smoking and claimed that she did not smoke at all, the Assistant Vice Principal demanded to see her purse. Upon opening the purse, he found a pack of cigarettes and also noticed a package of cigarette rolling papers that are commonly associated with the use of marihuana. He then proceeded to search the purse thoroughly and found some marihuana, a pipe, plastic bags, a fairly substantial amount of money, an index card containing a list of students who owed respondent money, and two letters that implicated her in marihuana dealing. Thereafter, the State brought delinquency charges against respondent in the Juvenile Court, which, after denying respondent's motion to suppress the evidence found in her purse, held that the Fourth Amendment applied to searches by school officials, but that the search in question was a reasonable one, and adjudged respondent to be a delinquent. The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the trial court's finding that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation, but vacated the adjudication of delinquency and remanded on other grounds. The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed and ordered the suppression of the evidence found in respondent's purse, holding that the search of the purse was unreasonable.\nHeld:\n1. The Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches conducted by public school officials, and is not limited to searches carried out by law enforcement officers. Nor are school officials exempt from the Amendment's dictates by virtue of the special nature of their authority over schoolchildren. In carrying out searches and other functions pursuant to disciplinary policies mandated by state statutes, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents of students, and they cannot claim the parents immunity from the Fourth Amendment's strictures. Pp. 469 U. S. 333 -337.\n2. Schoolchildren have legitimate expectations of privacy. They may find it necessary to carry with them a variety of legitimate, noncontraband items, and there is no reason to conclude that they have necessarily waived all rights to privacy in such items by bringing them onto school grounds. But striking the balance between schoolchildren's legitimate expectations of privacy and the school's equally legitimate need to maintain an environment in which learning can take place requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject. Thus, school officials need not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under their authority. Moreover, school officials need not be held subject to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law. Rather, the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search. Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a determination of whether the search was justified at its inception and whether, as conducted, it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place. Under ordinary circumstances, the search of a student by a school official will be justified at its inception where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. And such a search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search, and not excessively intrusive in light of the student's age and sex and the nature of the infraction. Pp. 469 U. S. 337 -343.\n3. Under the above standard, the search in this case was not unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. First, the initial search for cigarettes was reasonable. The report to the Assistant Vice Principal that respondent had been smoking warranted a reasonable suspicion that she had cigarettes in her purse, and thus the search was justified despite the fact that the cigarettes, if found, would constitute \"mere evidence\" of a violation of the no-smoking rule. Second, the discovery of the rolling papers then gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that respondent was carrying marihuana as well as cigarettes in her purse, and this suspicion justified the further exploration that turned up more evidence of drug-related activities.

Our consideration of the proper application of the Fourth Amendment to the public schools, however, has led us to conclude that the search that gave rise to\nthe case now before us did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, we here address only the questions of the proper standard for assessing the legality of searches conducted by public school officials and the application of that standard to the facts of this case.\nI\nOn March 7, 1980, a teacher at Piscataway High School in Middlesex County, N.J. discovered two girls smoking in a lavatory. One of the two girls was the respondent T.L.O, who at that time was a 14-year-old high school freshman. Because smoking in the lavatory was a violation of a school rule, the teacher took the two girls to the Principal's office, where they met with Assistant Vice Principal Theodore Choplick. In response to questioning by Mr. Choplick, T.L.O's companion admitted that she had violated the rule. T.L.O, however, denied that she had been smoking in the lavatory and claimed that she did not smoke at all.\nMr. Choplick asked T.L.O to come into his private office and demanded to see her purse. Opening the purse, he found a pack of cigarettes, which he removed from the purse and held before T.L.O as he accused her of having lied to him. As he reached into the purse for the cigarettes, Mr. Choplick also noticed a package of cigarette rolling papers. In his experience, possession of rolling papers by high school students was closely associated with the use of marihuana. Suspecting that a closer examination of the purse might yield further evidence of drug use, Mr. Choplick proceeded to search the purse thoroughly. The search revealed a small amount of marihuana, a pipe, a number of empty plastic bags, a substantial quantity of money in one-dollar bills, an index card that appeared to be a list of students who owed T.L.O money, and two letters that implicated T.L.O in marihuana dealing.\nMr. Choplick notified T.L.O's mother and the police, and turned the evidence of drug dealing over to the police. At\nthe request of the police, T.L.O's mother took her daughter to police headquarters, where T.L.O confessed that she had been selling marihuana at the high school. On the basis of the confession and the evidence seized by Mr. Choplick, the State brought delinquency charges against T.L.O in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Middlesex County. [ Footnote 1 ] Contending that Mr. Choplick's search of her purse violated the Fourth Amendment, T.L.O moved to suppress the evidence found in her purse as well as her confession, which, she argued, was tainted by the allegedly unlawful search. The Juvenile Court denied the motion to suppress. State ex rel. T.L.O., 178 N.J.Super. 329, 428 A.2d 1327 (1980). Although the court concluded that the Fourth Amendment did apply to searches carried out by school officials, it held that\n\"a school official may properly conduct a search of a student's person if the official has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is in the process of being committed, or reasonable cause to believe that the search is necessary to maintain school discipline or enforce school policies.\"\nId. at 341, 428 A.2d at 1333 (emphasis in original).\nApplying this standard, the court concluded that the search conducted by Mr. Choplick was a reasonable one. The initial decision to open the purse was justified by Mr. Choplick's well-founded suspicion that T.L.O had violated the rule forbidding smoking in the lavatory. Once the purse\nwas open, evidence of marihuana violations was in plain view, and Mr. Choplick was entitled to conduct a thorough search to determine the nature and extent of T.L.O's drug-related activities. Id. at 343, 428 A.2d at 1334. Having denied the motion to suppress, the court on March 23, 1981, found T.L.O. to be a delinquent and on January 8, 1982, sentenced her to a year's probation.\nOn appeal from the final judgment of the Juvenile Court, a divided Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's finding that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation, but vacated the adjudication of delinquency and remanded for a determination whether T.L.O. had knowingly and voluntarily waived her Fifth Amendment rights before confessing. State ex rel. T.L.O., 185 N.J.Super. 279, 448 A.2d 493 (1982). T.L.O. appealed the Fourth Amendment ruling, and the Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed the judgment of the Appellate Division and ordered the suppression of the evidence found in T.L.O.'s purse. State ex rel. T.L.O., 94 N.J. 331, 463 A.2d 934 (1983).\nThe New Jersey Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school officials. The court also rejected the State of New Jersey's argument that the exclusionary rule should not be employed to prevent the use in juvenile proceedings of evidence unlawfully seized by school officials. Declining to consider whether applying the rule to the fruits of searches by school officials would have any deterrent value, the court held simply that the precedents of this Court establish that \"if an official search violates constitutional rights, the evidence is not admissible in criminal proceedings.\" Id. at 341, 463 A.2d at 939 (footnote omitted).\nWith respect to the question of the legality of the search before it, the court agreed with the Juvenile Court that a warrantless search by a school official does not violate the Fourth Amendment so long as the official\n\"has reasonable grounds to believe that a student possesses evidence of illegal\nactivity or activity that would interfere with school discipline and order.\"\nId. at 346, 463 A.2d at 941-942. However, the court, with two justices dissenting, sharply disagreed with the Juvenile Court's conclusion that the search of the purse was reasonable. According to the majority, the contents of T.L.O.'s purse had no bearing on the accusation against T.L.O., for possession of cigarettes (as opposed to smoking them in the lavatory) did not violate school rules, and a mere desire for evidence that would impeach T.L.O.'s claim that she did not smoke cigarettes could not justify the search. Moreover, even if a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse would justify a search, Mr. Choplick had no such suspicion, as no one had furnished him with any specific information that there were cigarettes in the purse. Finally, leaving aside the question whether Mr. Choplick was justified in opening the purse, the court held that the evidence of drug use that he saw inside did not justify the extensive \"rummaging\" through T.L.O.'s papers and effects that followed. Id. at 347, 463 A.2d at 942-943.\nWe granted the State of New Jersey's petition for certiorari. 464 U.S. 991 (1983). Although the State had argued in the Supreme Court of New Jersey that the search of T.L.O.'s purse did not violate the Fourth Amendment, the petition for certiorari raised only the question whether the exclusionary rule should operate to bar consideration in juvenile delinquency proceedings of evidence unlawfully seized by a school official without the involvement of law enforcement officers. When this case was first argued last Term, the State conceded for the purpose of argument that the standard devised by the New Jersey Supreme Court for determining the legality of school searches was appropriate and that the court had correctly applied that standard; the State contended only that the remedial purposes of the exclusionary rule were not well served by applying it to searches conducted by public authorities not primarily engaged in law enforcement.\nAlthough we originally granted certiorari to decide the issue of the appropriate remedy in juvenile court proceedings for unlawful school searches, our doubts regarding the wisdom of deciding that question in isolation from the broader question of what limits, if any, the Fourth Amendment places on the activities of school authorities prompted us to order reargument on that question. [ Footnote 2 ] Having heard argument on\nthe legality of the search of T.L.O.'s purse, we are satisfied that the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment. [ Footnote 3 ]\nII\nIn determining whether the search at issue in this case violated the Fourth Amendment, we are faced initially with the question whether that Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches conducted by public school officials. We hold that it does.\nIt is now beyond dispute that\n\"the Federal Constitution, by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by state officers.\"\nElkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 , 364 U. S. 213 (1960); accord, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949). Equally indisputable is the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights of students against encroachment by public school officials:\n\"The Fourteenth Amendment, as now applied to the States, protects the citizen against the State itself and all of its creatures -- Boards of Education not excepted. These have, of course, important, delicate, and highly discretionary functions, but none that they may not perform within the limits of the Bill of Rights.

S. 637 (1943).\nThese two propositions -- that the Fourth Amendment applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the actions of public school officials are subject to the limits placed on state action by the Fourteenth Amendment -- might appear sufficient to answer the suggestion that the Fourth Amendment does not proscribe unreasonable searches by school officials. On reargument, however, the State of New Jersey has argued that the history of the Fourth Amendment indicates that the Amendment was intended to regulate only searches and seizures carried out by law enforcement officers; accordingly, although public school officials are concededly state agents for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment creates no rights enforceable against them. [ Footnote 4 ]\nIt may well be true that the evil toward which the Fourth Amendment was primarily directed was the resurrection of the pre-Revolutionary practice of using general warrants or \"writs of assistance\" to authorize searches for contraband by officers of the Crown. See United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 , 433 U. S. 7 -8 (1977); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 , 116 U. S. 624 -629 (1886). But this Court has never limited the Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures to operations conducted by the police. Rather, the Court has long spoken of the Fourth Amendment's strictures as restraints imposed upon \"governmental action\" -- that is, \"upon the activities of sovereign authority.\" Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U. S. 465 , 256 U. S. 475 (1921). Accordingly, we have held the Fourth Amendment applicable to the activities of civil as well as criminal authorities: building inspectors, see Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 , 387 U. S. 528 (1967), Occupational Safety and Health Act inspectors, see Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U. S. 307 , 436 U. S. 312 -313 (1978), and even firemen entering privately owned premises to battle a fire, see Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499 , 436 U. S. 506 (1978), are all subject to the restraints imposed by the Fourth Amendment. As we observed in Camara v. Municipal Court, supra,\n\"[t]he basic purpose of this Amendment, as recognized in countless decisions of this Court, is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\"\n387 U.S. at 387 U. S. 528 . Because the individual's interest in privacy and personal security \"suffers whether the government's motivation is to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory standards,\" Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., supra, at 436 U. S. 312 -313, it would be \"anomalous to say that the individual and his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.\" Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, at 387 U. S. 530 .\nNotwithstanding the general applicability of the Fourth Amendment to the activities of civil authorities, a few courts have concluded that school officials are exempt from the dictates of the Fourth Amendment by virtue of the special nature of their authority over schoolchildren. See, e.g., R.C.M. v. State, 660 S.W.2d 552 (Tex.App.1983). Teachers and school administrators, it is said, act in loco parentis in their dealings with students: their authority is that of the parent, not the State, and is therefore not subject to the limits of the Fourth Amendment. Ibid.\nSuch reasoning is in tension with contemporary reality and the teachings of this Court. We have held school officials subject to the commands of the First Amendment, see Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U. S. 503 (1969), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975). If school authorities are state actors for purposes of the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and due process, it is difficult to understand why they should be deemed to be exercising parental rather than public authority when conducting searches of their students. More generally, the Court has recognized that \"the concept of parental delegation\" as a source of school authority is not entirely \"consonant with compulsory education laws.\" Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 , 430 U. S. 662 (1977). Today's public school officials do not merely exercise authority voluntarily conferred on them by individual parents; rather, they act in furtherance of publicly mandated educational and disciplinary policies. See, e.g., the opinion in State ex rel. T.L.O., 94 N.J. at 343, 463 A.2d at 934, 940, describing the New Jersey statutes regulating school disciplinary policies and establishing the authority of school officials over their students. In carrying out searches and other disciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they\ncannot claim the parents' immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment.\nIII\nTo hold that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities is only to begin the inquiry into the standards governing such searches. Although the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable, what is reasonable depends on the context within which a search takes place. The determination of the standard of reasonableness governing any specific class of searches requires \"balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\" Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, at 387 U. S. 536 -537. On one side of the balance are arrayed the individual's legitimate expectations of privacy and personal security; on the other, the government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order.\nWe have recognized that even a limited search of the person is a substantial invasion of privacy. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , 392 U. S. 24 -25 (1967). We have also recognized that searches of closed items of personal luggage are intrusions on protected privacy interests, for \"the Fourth Amendment provides protection to the owner of every container that conceals its contents from plain view.\" United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 , 456 U. S. 822 -823 (1982). A search of a child's person or of a closed purse or other bag carried on her person, [ Footnote 5 ] no less\nthan a similar search carried out on an adult, is undoubtedly a severe violation of subjective expectations of privacy.\nOf course, the Fourth Amendment does not protect subjective expectations of privacy that are unreasonable or otherwise \"illegitimate.\" See, e.g., Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984); Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U. S. 98 (1980). To receive the protection of the Fourth Amendment, an expectation of privacy must be one that society is \"prepared to recognize as legitimate.\" Hudson v. Palmer, supra, at 468 U. S. 526 . The State of New Jersey has argued that, because of the pervasive supervision to which children in the schools are necessarily subject, a child has virtually no legitimate expectation of privacy in articles of personal property \"unnecessarily\" carried into a school. This argument has two factual premises: (1) the fundamental incompatibility of expectations of privacy with the maintenance of a sound educational environment; and (2) the minimal interest of the child in bringing any items of personal property into the school. Both premises are severely flawed.\nAlthough this Court may take notice of the difficulty of maintaining discipline in the public schools today, the situation is not so dire that students in the schools may claim no legitimate expectations of privacy. We have recently recognized that the need to maintain order in a prison is such that prisoners retain no legitimate expectations of privacy in their cells, but it goes almost without saying that \"[t]he prisoner and the schoolchild stand in wholly different circumstances, separated by the harsh facts of criminal conviction and incarceration.\" Ingraham v. Wright, supra, at 430 U. S. 669 . We are not\nyet ready to hold that the schools and the prisons need be equated for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\nNor does the State's suggestion that children have no legitimate need to bring personal property into the schools seem well anchored in reality. Students at a minimum must bring to school not only the supplies needed for their studies, but also keys, money, and the necessaries of personal hygiene and grooming. In addition, students may carry on their persons or in purses or wallets such nondisruptive yet highly personal items as photographs, letters, and diaries. Finally, students may have perfectly legitimate reasons to carry with them articles of property needed in connection with extracurricular or recreational activities. In short, schoolchildren may find it necessary to carry with them a variety of legitimate, noncontraband items, and there is no reason to conclude that they have necessarily waived all rights to privacy in such items merely by bringing them onto school grounds.\nAgainst the child's interest in privacy must be set the substantial interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in the classroom and on school grounds. Maintaining order in the classroom has never been easy, but in recent years, school disorder has often taken particularly ugly forms: drug use and violent crime in the schools have become major social problems. See generally 1 NIE, U.S. Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare, Violent Schools -- Safe Schools: The Safe School Study Report to the Congress (1978). Even in schools that have been spared the most severe disciplinary problems, the preservation of order and a proper educational environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren, as well as the enforcement of rules against conduct that would be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult. \"Events calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action.\" Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 580 . Accordingly, we have recognized\nthat maintaining security and order in the schools requires a certain degree of flexibility in school disciplinary procedures, and we have respected the value of preserving the informality of the student-teacher relationship. See id. at 419 U. S. 582 -583; Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. at 430 U. S. 680 -682.\nHow, then, should we strike the balance between the schoolchild's legitimate expectations of privacy and the school's equally legitimate need to maintain an environment in which learning can take place? It is evident that the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject. The warrant requirement, in particular, is unsuited to the school environment: requiring a teacher to obtain a warrant before searching a child suspected of an infraction of school rules (or of the criminal law) would unduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures needed in the schools. Just as we have in other cases dispensed with the warrant requirement when \"the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search,\" Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. at 387 U. S. 532 -533, we hold today that school officials need not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under their authority.\nThe school setting also requires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search. Ordinarily, a search -- even one that may permissibly be carried out without a warrant -- must be based upon \"probable cause\" to believe that a violation of the law has occurred. See, e.g., Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U. S. 266 , 413 U. S. 273 (1973); Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 , 392 U. S. 62 -66 (1968). However, \"probable cause\" is not an irreducible requirement of a valid search. The fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searches and seizures be reasonable, and although\n\"both the concept of probable cause and the requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a search, . . . in certain limited circumstances neither is required.\"\nJ., concurring). Thus, we have in a number of cases recognized the legality of searches and seizures based on suspicions that, although \"reasonable,\" do not rise to the level of probable cause. See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968); United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 , 422 U. S. 881 (195); Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648 , 440 U. S. 654 -655 (1979); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 (1976); cf. Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, at 387 U. S. 534 -539. Where a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause, we have not hesitated to adopt such a standard.\nWe join the majority of courts that have examined this issue [ Footnote 6 ] in concluding that the accommodation of the privacy interests of schoolchildren with the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools does not require strict adherence to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law. Rather, the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search. Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a twofold inquiry: first, one must consider \"whether the . . . action was justified at its inception,\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 392 U. S. 20 ; second, one must determine whether the search as actually conducted \"was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place,\" ibid. Under ordinary circumstances, a search of a student by a teacher or other school official [ Footnote 7 ] will be\n\"justified at its inception\" when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. [ Footnote 8 ] Such a search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction. [ Footnote 9 ]\nThis standard will, we trust, neither unduly burden the efforts of school authorities to maintain order in their schools\nnor authorize unrestrained intrusions upon the privacy of schoolchildren. By focusing attention on the question of reasonableness, the standard will spare teachers and school administrators the necessity of schooling themselves in the niceties of probable cause and permit them to regulate their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense. At the same time, the reasonableness standard should ensure that the interests of students will be invaded no more than is necessary to achieve the legitimate end of preserving order in the schools.\nIV\nThere remains the question of the legality of the search in this case. We recognize that the \"reasonable grounds\" standard applied by the New Jersey Supreme Court in its consideration of this question is not substantially different from the standard that we have adopted today. Nonetheless, we believe that the New Jersey court's application of that standard to strike down the search of T.L.O.'s purse reflects a somewhat crabbed notion of reasonableness. Our review of the facts surrounding the search leads us to conclude that the search was in no sense unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. [ Footnote 10 ]\nThe incident that gave rise to this case actually involved two separate searches, with the first -- the search for cigarettes -- providing the suspicion that gave rise to the second\n-- the search for marihuana. Although it is the fruits of the second search that are at issue here, the validity of the search for marihuana must depend on the reasonableness of the initial search for cigarettes, as there would have been no reason to suspect that T.L.O. possessed marihuana had the first search not taken place. Accordingly, it is to the search for cigarettes that we first turn our attention.\nThe New Jersey Supreme Court pointed to two grounds for its holding that the search for cigarettes was unreasonable. First, the court observed that possession of cigarettes was not in itself illegal or a violation of school rules. Because the contents of T.L.O.'s purse would therefore have \"no direct bearing on the infraction\" of which she was accused (smoking in a lavatory where smoking was prohibited), there was no reason to search her purse. [ Footnote 11 ] Second, even assuming that a search of T.L.O.'s purse might under some circumstances be reasonable in light of the accusation made against T.L.O., the New Jersey court concluded that Mr. Choplick in this particular case had no reasonable grounds to suspect that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse. At best, according\nto the court, Mr. Choplick had \"a good hunch.\" 94 N.J. at 347, 463 A.2d at 942.\nBoth these conclusions are implausible. T.L.O. had been accused of smoking, and had denied the accusation in the strongest possible terms when she stated that she did not smoke at all. Surely it cannot be said that under these circumstances, T.L.O.'s possession of cigarettes would be irrelevant to the charges against her or to her response to those charges. T.L.O.'s possession of cigarettes, once it was discovered, would both corroborate the report that she had been smoking and undermine the credibility of her defense to the charge of smoking. To be sure, the discovery of the cigarettes would not prove that T.L.O. had been smoking in the lavatory; nor would it, strictly speaking, necessarily be inconsistent with her claim that she did not smoke at all. But it is universally recognized that evidence, to be relevant to an inquiry, need not conclusively prove the ultimate fact in issue, but only have\n\"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"\nFed.Rule Evid. 401. The relevance of T.L.O.'s possession of cigarettes to the question whether she had been smoking and to the credibility of her denial that she smoked supplied the necessary \"nexus\" between the item searched for and the infraction under investigation. See Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 , 387 U. S. 306 -307 (1967). Thus, if Mr. Choplick in fact had a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse, the search was justified despite the fact that the cigarettes, if found, would constitute \"mere evidence\" of a violation. Ibid.\nOf course, the New Jersey Supreme Court also held that Mr. Choplick had no reasonable suspicion that the purse would contain cigarettes. This conclusion is puzzling. A teacher had reported that T.L.O. was smoking in the lavatory. Certainly this report gave Mr. Choplick reason to suspect that T.L.O. was carrying cigarettes with her; and\nif she did have cigarettes, her purse was the obvious place in which to find them. Mr. Choplick's suspicion that there were cigarettes in the purse was not an \"inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch,'\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 392 U. S. 27 ; rather, it was the sort of \"common-sense conclusio[n] about human behavior\" upon which \"practical people\" -- including government officials -- are entitled to rely. United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411 , 449 U. S. 418 (1981). Of course, even if the teacher's report were true, T.L.O. might not have had a pack of cigarettes with her; she might have borrowed a cigarette from someone else or have been sharing a cigarette with another student. But the requirement of reasonable suspicion is not a requirement of absolute certainty: \"sufficient probability, not certainty, is the touchstone of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment. . . .\" Hill v. California, 401 U. S. 797 , 401 U. S. 804 (1971). Because the hypothesis that T.L.O. was carrying cigarettes in her purse was itself not unreasonable, it is irrelevant that other hypotheses were also consistent with the teacher's accusation. Accordingly, it cannot be said that Mr. Choplick acted unreasonably when he examined T.L.O.'s purse to see if it contained cigarettes. [ Footnote 12 ]\nOur conclusion that Mr. Choplick's decision to open T.L.O.'s purse was reasonable brings us to the question of the further search for marihuana once the pack of cigarettes was located. The suspicion upon which the search for marihuana was founded was provided when Mr. Choplick observed a package of rolling papers in the purse as he removed the pack of cigarettes. Although T.L.O. does not dispute the reasonableness of Mr. Choplick's belief that the rolling papers indicated the presence of marihuana, she does contend that the scope of the search Mr. Choplick conducted exceeded permissible bounds when he seized and read certain letters that implicated T.L.O. in drug dealing. This argument, too, is unpersuasive. The discovery of the rolling papers concededly gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. was carrying marihuana as well as cigarettes in her purse. This suspicion justified further exploration of T.L.O.'s purse, which turned up more evidence of drug-related activities: a pipe, a number of plastic bags of the type commonly used to store marihuana, a small quantity of marihuana, and a fairly substantial amount of money. Under these circumstances, it was not unreasonable to extend the search to a separate zippered compartment of the purse; and when a search of that compartment revealed an index card containing a list of \"people who owe me money\" as well as two letters, the inference that T.L.O. was involved in marihuana trafficking was substantial enough to justify Mr. Choplick in examining the letters to determine whether they contained any further evidence. In short, we cannot conclude that the search for marihuana was unreasonable in any respect.\nBecause the search resulting in the discovery of the evidence of marihuana dealing by T.L.O. was reasonable, the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision to exclude that evidence\nfrom T.L.O.'s juvenile delinquency proceedings on Fourth Amendment grounds was erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey is\nReversed.\nT.L.O. also received a 3-day suspension from school for smoking cigarettes in a nonsmoking area and a 7-day suspension for possession of marihuana. On T.L.O.'s motion, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, set aside the 7-day suspension on the ground that it was based on evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. (T.L.O.) v. Piscataway Bd. of Ed., No. C.2865-79 (Super.Ct. N.J. Ch.Div., Mar. 31, 1980). The Board of Education apparently did not appeal the decision of the Chancery Division.\nState and federal courts considering these questions have struggled to accommodate the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment and the interest of the States in providing a safe environment conducive to education in the public schools. Some courts have resolved the tension between these interests by giving full force to one or the other side of the balance. Thus, in a number of cases courts have held that school officials conducting in-school searches of students are private parties acting in loco parentis and are therefore not subject to the constraints of the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., D. R. C. v. State, 646 P.2d 252 (Alaska App.1982); In re G., 11 Cal. App. 3d 1193 , 90 Cal. Rptr. 361 (1970); In re Donaldson, 269 Cal. App. 2d 509 , 75 Cal. Rptr. 220 (1969); R.C.M. v. State, 660 S.W.2d 552 (Tex.App.1983); Mercer v. State, 450 S.W.2d 715 (Tex.Civ.App.1970). At least one court has held, on the other hand, that the Fourth Amendment applies in full to in-school searches by school officials and that a search conducted without probable cause is unreasonable, see State v. Mora, 307 So. 2d 317 (La.), vacated, 423 U.S. 809 (1975), on remand, 330 So. 2d 900 (La.1976); others have held or suggested that the probable cause standard is applicable at least where the police are involved in a search, see M. v. Board of Ed. Ball-Chatham Community Unit School Dist. No. 5, 429 F. Supp. 288 , 292 (SD Ill.1977); Picha v. Wielgos, 410 F. Supp. 1214 , 1219-1221 (ND Ill.1976); State v. Young, 234 Ga. 488, 498, 216 S.E.2d 586 , 594 (1975); or where the search is highly intrusive, See M.M. v. Anker, 607 F.2d 588, 589 (CA2 1979).\nThe majority of courts that have addressed the issue of the Fourth Amendment in the schools have, like the Supreme Court of New Jersey in this case, reached a middle position: the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities, but the special needs of the school environment require assessment of the legality of such searches against a standard less exacting than that of probable cause. These courts have, by and large, upheld warrantless searches by school authorities provided that they are supported by a reasonable suspicion that the search will uncover evidence of an infraction of school disciplinary rules or a violation of the law. See, e.g., Tarter v. Raybuck, No. 83-3174 (CA6, Aug. 31, 1984); Bilorey v. Brown, 738 F.2d 1462 (CA9 1984); Hortol v. Goose Creek Independent School Dist., 690 F.2d 470 (CA5 1982); Bellnier v. Lund, 438 F. Supp. 47 (NDNY 1977); M. v. Board of Ed. Ball-Chatham Community Unit School Dist. No. 5, supra; In re W., 29 Cal. App. 3d 777 , 105 Cal. Rptr. 775 (1973); State v. Baccino, 282 A.2d 869 (Del. Super.1971); State v. D.T.W., 425 So. 2d 1383 (Fla.App.1983); State v. Young, supra; In re J.A. 85 Ill.App.3d 567, 406 N.E.2d 958 (1980); People v. Ward, 62 Mich.App. 46, 233 N.W.2d 180 (1975); Doe v. State, 88 N.M. 347, 540 P.2d 827 (App.1975); People v. D., 34 N.Y.2d 483, 315 N.E.2d 466 (1974); State v. McKinnon, 88 Wash. 2d 75 , 558 P.2d 781 (1977); In re L.L., 90 Wis.2d 585, 280 N.W.2d 343 (App.1979).\nAlthough few have considered the matter, courts have also split over whether the exclusionary rule is an appropriate remedy for Fourth Amendment violations committed by school authorities. The Georgia courts have held that although the Fourth Amendment applies to the schools, the exclusionary rule does not. See, e.g., State v. Young, supra; State v. Lamb, 137 Ga.App. 437, 224 S.E.2d 51 (1976). Other jurisdictions have applied the rule to exclude the fruits of unlawful school searches from criminal trials and delinquency proceedings. See State v. Mora, supra; People v. D., supra.\nIn holding that the search of T.L.O.'s purse did not violate the Fourth Amendment, we do not implicitly determine that the exclusionary rule applies to the fruits of unlawful searches conducted by school authorities. The question whether evidence should be excluded from a criminal proceeding involves two discrete inquiries: whether the evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and whether the exclusionary rule is the appropriate remedy for the violation. Neither question is logically antecedent to the other, for a negative answer to either question is sufficient to dispose of the case. Thus, our determination that the search at issue in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment implies no particular resolution of the question of the applicability of the exclusionary rule.\nCf. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977) (holding that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment applies only to punishments imposed after criminal convictions and hence does not apply to the punishment of schoolchildren by public school officials).\nWe do not address the question, not presented by this case, whether a schoolchild has a legitimate expectation of privacy in lockers, desks, or other school property provided for the storage of school supplies. Nor do we express any opinion on the standards of any governing searches of such areas by school officials or by other public authorities acting at the request of school officials. Compare Zamora v. Pomeroy, 639 F.2d 662, 670 (CA10 1981) (\"Inasmuch as the school had assumed joint control of the locker it cannot be successfully maintained that the school did not have a right to inspect it\"), and People v. Overton, 24 N.Y.2d 522, 249 N.E.2d 366 (1969) (school administrators have power to consent to search of a student's locker), with State v. Engerud, 94 N.J. 331, 348, 463 A.2d 934 , 943 (1983) (\"We are satisfied that in the context of this case the student had an expectation of privacy in the contents of his locker. . . . For the four years of high school, the school locker is a home away from home. In it the student stores the kind of personal effects' protected by the Fourth Amendment\").\nSee cases cited in n. 2 supra.\nWe here consider only searches carried out by school authorities acting alone and on their own authority. This case does not present the question of the appropriate standard for assessing the legality of searches conducted by school officials in conjunction with or at the behest of law enforcement agencies, and we express no opinion on that question. Cf. Picha v. Wielgos, 410 F. Supp. 1214 , 1219-1221 (ND.Ill. 1976) (holding probable cause standard applicable to searches involving the police).\nWe do not decide whether individualized suspicion is an essential element of the reasonableness standard we adopt for searches by school authorities. In other contexts, however, we have held that although\n\"some quantum of individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure[,] . . . the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion.\"\nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 428 U. S. 560 -561 (1976). See also Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 (1967). Exceptions to the requirement of individualized suspicion are generally appropriate only where the privacy interests implicated by a search are minimal and where \"other safeguards\" are available \"to assure that the individual's reasonable expectation of privacy is not subject to the discretion of the official in the field.'\" Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648 , 440 U. S. 654 -655 (1979) (citation omitted). Because the search of T.L.O.'s purse was based upon an individualized suspicion that she had violated school rules, see infra, at 469 U. S. 343 -347, we need not consider the circumstances that might justify school authorities in conducting searches unsupported by individualized suspicion.\nOur reference to the nature of the infraction is not intended as an endorsement of JUSTICE STEVENS' suggestion that some rules regarding student conduct are by nature too \"trivial\" to justify a search based upon reasonable suspicion. See post at 469 U. S. 377 -382. We are unwilling to adopt a standard under which the legality of a search is dependent upon a judge's evaluation of the relative importance of various school rules. The maintenance of discipline in the schools requires not only that students be restrained from assaulting one another, abusing drugs and alcohol, and committing other crimes, but also that students conform themselves to the standards of conduct prescribed by school authorities. We have\n\"repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\"\nTinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U. S. 503 , 393 U. S. 507 (1969). The promulgation of a rule forbidding specified conduct presumably reflects a judgment on the part of school officials that such conduct is destructive of school order or of a proper educational environment. Absent any suggestion that the rule violates some substantive constitutional guarantee, the courts should, as a general matter, defer to that judgment and refrain from attempting to distinguish between rules that are important to the preservation of order in the schools and rules that are not.\nOf course, New Jersey may insist on a more demanding standard under its own Constitution or statutes. In that case, its courts would not purport to be applying the Fourth Amendment when they invalidate a search.\nJUSTICE STEVENS interprets these statements as a holding that enforcement of the school's smoking regulations was not sufficiently related to the goal of maintaining discipline or order in the school to justify a search under the standard adopted by the New Jersey court. See post at 469 U. S. 382 -384. We do not agree that this is an accurate characterization of the New Jersey Supreme Court's opinion. The New Jersey court did not hold that the school's smoking rules were unrelated to the goal of maintaining discipline or order, nor did it suggest that a search that would produce evidence bearing directly on an accusation that a student had violated the smoking rules would be impermissible under the court's reasonable-suspicion standard; rather, the court concluded that any evidence a search of T.L.O.'s purse was likely to produce would not have a sufficiently direct bearing on the infraction to justify a search -- a conclusion with which we cannot agree for the reasons set forth infra, at 469 U. S. 345 . JUSTICE STEVENS' suggestion that the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision rested on the perceived triviality of the smoking infraction appears to be a reflection of his own views rather than those of the New Jersey court.\nT.L.O. contends that even if it was reasonable for Mr. Choplick to open her purse to look for cigarettes, it was not reasonable for him to reach in and take the cigarettes out of her purse once he found them. Had he not removed the cigarettes from the purse, she asserts, he would not have observed the rolling papers that suggested the presence of marihuana, and the search for marihuana could not have taken place. T.L.O.'s argument is based on the fact that the cigarettes were not \"contraband,\" as no school rule forbade her to have them. Thus, according to T.L.O., the cigarettes were not subject to seizure or confiscation by school authorities, and Mr. Choplick was not entitled to take them out of T.L.O.'s purse regardless of whether he was entitled to peer into the purse to see if they were there. Such hairsplitting argumentation has no place in an inquiry addressed to the issue of reasonableness. If Mr. Choplick could permissibly search T.L.O.'s purse for cigarettes, it hardly seems reasonable to suggest that his natural reaction to finding them -- picking them up -- could be a constitutional violation. We find that neither in opening the purse nor in reaching into it to remove the cigarettes did Mr. Choplick violate the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE POWELL, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins, concurring.\nI agree with the Court's decision, and generally with its opinion. I would place greater emphasis, however, on the special characteristics of elementary and secondary schools that make it unnecessary to afford students the same constitutional protections granted adults and juveniles in a nonschool setting.\nIn any realistic sense, students within the school environment have a lesser expectation of privacy than members of the population generally. They spend the school hours in close association with each other, both in the classroom and during recreation periods. The students in a particular class often know each other and their teachers quite well. Of necessity, teachers have a degree of familiarity with, and authority over, their students that is unparalleled except perhaps in the relationship between parent and child. It is simply unrealistic to think that students have the same subjective expectation of privacy as the population generally. But for purposes of deciding this case, I can assume that children in school -- no less than adults -- have privacy interests that society is prepared to recognize as legitimate.\nHowever one may characterize their privacy expectations, students properly are afforded some constitutional protections. In an often quoted statement, the Court said that students do not \"shed their constitutional rights . . . at the schoolhouse gate.\" Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U. S. 503 , 393 U. S. 506 (1969). The Court also has \"emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the states and of school officials . . .\nto prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\" Id. at 393 U. S. 507 . See also Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 , 393 U. S. 104 (1968). The Court has balanced the interests of the student against the school officials' need to maintain discipline by recognizing qualitative differences between the constitutional remedies to which students and adults are entitled.\nIn Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975), the Court recognized a constitutional right to due process, and yet was careful to limit the exercise of this right by a student who challenged a disciplinary suspension. The only process found to be \"due\" was notice and a hearing described as \"rudimentary\"; it amounted to no more than \"the disciplinarian . . . informally discuss[ing] the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred.\" Id. at 419 U. S. 581 -582. In Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977), we declined to extend the Eighth Amendment to prohibit the use of corporal punishment of schoolchildren as authorized by Florida law. We emphasized in that opinion that familiar constraints in the school, and also in the community, provide substantial protection against the violation of constitutional rights by school authorities.\n\"[A]t the end of the school day, the child is invariably free to return home. Even while at school, the child brings with him the support of family and friends and is rarely apart from teachers and other pupils who may witness and protest any instances of mistreatment.\"\nId. at 430 U. S. 670 . The Ingraham Court further pointed out that the \"openness of the public school and its supervision by the community afford significant safeguards\" against the violation of constitutional rights. Ibid.\nThe special relationship between teacher and student also distinguishes the setting within which schoolchildren operate. Law enforcement officers function as adversaries of criminal suspects. These officers have the responsibility to investigate criminal activity, to locate and arrest those who violate our laws, and to facilitate the charging and bringing of such persons to trial. Rarely does this type of adversarial\nrelationship exist between school authorities and pupils. [ Footnote 2/1 ] Instead, there is a commonality of interests between teachers and their pupils. The attitude of the typical teacher is one of personal responsibility for the student's welfare as well as for his education.\nThe primary duty of school officials and teachers, as the Court states, is the education and training of young people. A State has a compelling interest in assuring that the schools meet this responsibility. Without first establishing discipline and maintaining order, teachers cannot begin to educate their students. And apart from education, the school has the obligation to protect pupils from mistreatment by other children, and also to protect teachers themselves from violence by the few students whose conduct in recent years has prompted national concern. For me, it would be unreasonable and at odds with history to argue that the full panoply of constitutional rules applies with the same force and effect in the schoolhouse as it does in the enforcement of criminal laws. [ Footnote 2/2 ]\nIn sum, although I join the Court's opinion and its holding, [ Footnote 2/3 ] my emphasis is somewhat different.\nUnlike police officers, school authorities have no law enforcement responsibility or indeed any obligation to be familiar with the criminal laws. Of course, as illustrated by this case, school authorities have a layman's familiarity with the types of crimes that occur frequently in our schools: the distribution and use of drugs, theft, and even violence against teachers as well as fellow students.\nAs noted above, decisions of this Court have never held to the contrary. The law recognizes a host of distinctions between the rights and duties of children and those of adults. See Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 , 419 U. S. 591 (1975) (POWELL, J., dissenting.)\nThe Court's holding is that \"when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that [a] search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school,\" a search of the student's person or belongings is justified. Ante at 469 U. S. 342 . This is in accord with the Court's summary of the views of a majority of the state and federal courts that have addressed this issue. See ante at 469 U. S. 332 -333, n. 2.\nJUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment.\nI join the judgment of the Court and agree with much that is said in its opinion. I write separately, however, because I believe the Court omits a crucial step in its analysis of whether a school search must be based upon probable cause. The Court correctly states that we have recognized limited exceptions to the probable cause requirement \"[w]here a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served\" by a lesser standard. Ante at 469 U. S. 341 . I believe that we have used such a balancing test, rather than strictly applying the Fourth Amendment's Warrant and Probable-Cause Clause, only when we were confronted with \"a special law enforcement need for greater flexibility.\" Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491 , 460 U. S. 514 (1983) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). I pointed out in United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983):\n\"While the Fourth Amendment speaks in terms of freedom from unreasonable [searches], the Amendment does not leave the reasonableness of most [searches] to the judgment of courts or government officers; the Framers of the Amendment balanced the interests involved and decided that a [search] is reasonable only if supported by a judicial warrant based on probable cause. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730 , 460 U. S. 744 -745 (1983) (POWELL, J., concurring); United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 , 339 U. S. 70 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).\"\nId. at 462 U. S. 722 (opinion concurring in judgment). See also Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200 , 442 U. S. 213 -214 (1979); United States v. United States District Court, 407 U. S. 297 , 407 U. S. 315 -316 (1972). Only in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable, is a court entitled to substitute its balancing of interests for that of the Framers.\nThus, for example, in determining that police can conduct a limited \"stop and frisk\" upon less than probable cause, this Court relied upon the fact that \"as a practical matter\" the stop and frisk could not be subjected to a warrant and probable cause requirement, because a law enforcement officer must be able to take immediate steps to assure himself that the person he has stopped to question is not armed with a weapon that could be used against him. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , 392 U. S. 20 -21, 392 U. S. 23 -24 (1968). Similarly, this Court's holding that a roving Border Patrol may stop a car and briefly question its occupants upon less than probable cause was based in part upon \"the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border.\" United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 , 422 U. S. 881 (1975). See also Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 , 463 U. S. 1049 , n. 14 (1983); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 428 U. S. 557 (1976); Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 , 387 U. S. 537 (1967).\nThe Court's implication that the balancing test is the rule rather than the exception is troubling for me because it is unnecessary in this case. The elementary and secondary school setting presents a special need for flexibility justifying a departure from the balance struck by the Framers. As JUSTICE POWELL notes, \"[w]ithout first establishing discipline and maintaining order, teachers cannot begin to educate their students.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 350 . Maintaining order in the classroom can be a difficult task. A single teacher often must watch over a large number of students, and, as any parent knows, children at certain ages are inclined to test the outer boundaries of acceptable conduct and to imitate the misbehavior of a peer if that misbehavior is not dealt with quickly. Every adult remembers from his own schooldays the havoc a water pistol or peashooter can wreak until it is taken away. Thus, the Court has recognized that \"[e]vents calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action.\" Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 , 419 U. S. 580 (1975). Indeed, because drug use and possession of weapons have become increasingly common\namong young people, an immediate response frequently is required not just to maintain an environment conducive to learning, but to protect the very safety of students and school personnel.\nSuch immediate action obviously would not be possible if a teacher were required to secure a warrant before searching a student. Nor would it be possible if a teacher could not conduct a necessary search until the teacher thought there was probable cause for the search. A teacher has neither the training nor the day-to-day experience in the complexities of probable cause that a law enforcement officer possesses, and is ill-equipped to make a quick judgment about the existence of probable cause. The time required for a teacher to ask the questions or make the observations that are necessary to turn reasonable grounds into probable cause is time during which the teacher, and other students, are diverted from the essential task of education. A teacher's focus is, and should be, on teaching and helping students, rather than on developing evidence against a particular troublemaker.\nEducation \"is perhaps the most important function\" of government, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 , 347 U. S. 493 (1954), and government has a heightened obligation to safeguard students whom it compels to attend school. The special need for an immediate response to behavior that threatens either the safety of schoolchildren and teachers or the educational process itself justifies the Court in excepting school searches from the warrant and probable cause requirement, and in applying a standard determined by balancing the relevant interests. I agree with the standard the Court has announced, and with its application of the standard to the facts of this case. I therefore concur in its judgment.\nJUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI fully agree with Part 469 U. S. Teachers, like all other government officials, must conform their\nconduct to the Fourth Amendment's protections of personal privacy and personal security. As JUSTICE STEVENS points out, post at 469 U. S. 373 -374, 469 U. S. 385 -386, this principle is of particular importance when applied to schoolteachers, for children learn as much by example as by exposition. It would be incongruous and futile to charge teachers with the task of embuing their students with an understanding of our system of constitutional democracy, while at the same time immunizing those same teachers from the need to respect constitutional protections. See Board of Education v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853 , 457 U. S. 864 -865 (1982) (plurality opinion); West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 , 319 U. S. 637 (1943).\nI do not, however, otherwise join the Court's opinion. Today's decision sanctions school officials to conduct fullscale searches on a \"reasonableness\" standard whose only definite content is that it is not the same test as the \"probable cause\" standard found in the text of the Fourth Amendment. In adopting this unclear, unprecedented, and unnecessary departure from generally applicable Fourth Amendment standards, the Court carves out a broad exception to standards that this Court has developed over years of considering Fourth Amendment problems. Its decision is supported neither by precedent nor even by a fair application of the \"balancing test\" it proclaims in this very opinion.\nI\nThree basic principles underly this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. First, warrantless searches are per se unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically delineated and well-recognized exceptions. See, e.g., Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 , 389 U. S. 357 (1967); accord, Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740 , 466 U. S. 748 -749 (1984); United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 , 462 U. S. 701 (1983); Steagald v. United States, 451 U. S. 204 , 451 U. S. 211 -212 (1981); Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , 392 U. S. 20 (1968); Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 , 333 U. S. 13 -14 (1948). Second, full-scale searches -- whether conducted in accordance with the warrant\nrequirement or pursuant to one of its exceptions -- are \"reasonable\" in Fourth Amendment terms only on a showing of probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that evidence of the crime will be found in the place to be searched. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U. S. 89 , 379 U. S. 91 (1964); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471 , 371 U. S. 479 (1963); Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160 , 338 U. S. 175 -176 (1949). Third, categories of intrusions that are substantially less intrusive than full-scale searches or seizures may be justifiable in accordance with a balancing test even absent a warrant or probable cause, provided that the balancing test used gives sufficient weight to the privacy interests that will be infringed. Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200 , 442 U. S. 210 (1979); Terry v. Ohio, supra.\nAssistant Vice Principal Choplick's thorough excavation of T.L.O.'s purse was undoubtedly a serious intrusion on her privacy. Unlike the searches in Terry v. Ohio, supra, or Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143 (1972), the search at issue here encompassed a detailed and minute examination of respondent's pocketbook, in which the contents of private papers and letters were thoroughly scrutinized. [ Footnote 3/1 ] Wisely, neither petitioner nor the Court today attempts to justify the search of T.L.O.'s pocketbook as a minimally intrusive search in the Terry line. To be faithful to the Court's settled doctrine, the inquiry therefore must focus on the warrant and probable cause requirements.\nA\nI agree that schoolteachers or principals, when not acting as agents of law enforcement authorities, generally may conduct a search of their students' belongings without first\nobtaining a warrant. To agree with the Court on this point is to say that school searches may justifiably be held to that extent to constitute an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. Such an exception, however, is not to be justified, as the Court apparently holds, by assessing net social value through application of an unguided \"balancing test\" in which \"the individual's legitimate expectations of privacy and personal security\" are weighed against \"the government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 337 . The Warrant Clause is something more than an exhortation to this Court to maximize social welfare as we see fit. It requires that the authorities must obtain a warrant before conducting a full-scale search. The undifferentiated governmental interest in law enforcement is insufficient to justify an exception to the warrant requirement. Rather, some special governmental interest beyond the need merely to apprehend lawbreakers is necessary to justify a categorical exception to the warrant requirement. For the most part, special governmental needs sufficient to override the warrant requirement flow from \"exigency\" -- that is, from the press of time that makes obtaining a warrant either impossible or hopelessly infeasible. See United States v. Place, supra, at 462 U. S. 701 -702; Mincey v. Arizona, supra, at 437 U. S. 393 -394; Johnson v. United States, supra, at 333 U. S. 15 . Only after finding an extraordinary governmental interest of this kind do we -- or ought we -- engage in a balancing test to determine if a warrant should nonetheless be required. [ Footnote 3/2 ]\nTo require a showing of some extraordinary governmental interest before dispensing with the warrant requirement is not to undervalue society's need to apprehend violators of the criminal law. To be sure, forcing law enforcement personnel to obtain a warrant before engaging in a search will predictably deter the police from conducting some searches that they would otherwise like to conduct. But this is not an unintended result of the Fourth Amendment's protection of privacy; rather, it is the very purpose for which the Amendment was thought necessary. Only where the governmental interests at stake exceed those implicated in any ordinary law enforcement context -- that is, only where there is some extraordinary governmental interest involved -- is it legitimate to engage in a balancing test to determine whether a warrant is indeed necessary.\nIn this case, such extraordinary governmental interests do exist and are sufficient to justify an exception to the warrant requirement. Students are necessarily confined for most of the schoolday in close proximity to each other and to the school staff. I agree with the Court that we can take judicial notice of the serious problems of drugs and violence that plague our schools. As JUSTICE BLACKMUN notes, teachers must not merely \"maintain an environment conducive to learning\" among children who \"are inclined to test the outer boundaries of acceptable conduct,\" but must also \"protect the very safety of students and school personnel.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 352 -353. A teacher or principal could neither carry out essential teaching functions nor adequately protect students' safety if required to wait for a warrant before conducting a necessary search.\nB\nI emphatically disagree with the Court's decision to cast aside the constitutional probable cause standard when assessing the constitutional validity of a schoolhouse search. The Court's decision jettisons the probable cause standard -- the only standard that finds support in the text of the Fourth\nAmendment -- on the basis of its Rohrschach-1ike \"balancing test.\" Use of such a \"balancing test\" to determine the standard for evaluating the validity of a full-scale search represents a sizable innovation in Fourth Amendment analysis. This innovation finds support neither in precedent nor policy and portends a dangerous weakening of the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to protect the privacy and security of our citizens. Moreover, even if this Court's historic understanding of the Fourth Amendment were mistaken and a balancing test of some kind were appropriate, any such test that gave adequate weight to the privacy and security interests protected by the Fourth Amendment would not reach the preordained result the Court's conclusory analysis reaches today. Therefore, because I believe that the balancing test used by the Court today is flawed both in its inception and in its execution, I respectfully dissent.\n1\nAn unbroken line of cases in this Court have held that probable cause is a prerequisite for a full-scale search. In Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 , 267 U. S. 149 (1925), the Court held that \"[o]n reason and authority the true rule is that, if the search and seizure . . . are made upon probable cause . . . the search and seizure are valid.\" Under our past decisions probable cause -- which exists where\n\"the facts and circumstances within [the officials'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\"\nthat a criminal offense had occurred and the evidence would be found in the suspected place, id. at 267 U. S. 162 -- is the constitutional minimum for justifying a full-scale search, regardless of whether it is conducted pursuant to a warrant or, as in Carroll, within one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98 , 361 U. S. 104 (1959) ( Caroll \"merely relaxed the requirements for a warrant on grounds of practicality,\" but \"did not dispense\nwith the need for probable cause\"); accord, Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 , 399 U. S. 51 (1970) (\"In enforcing the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Court has insisted upon probable cause as a minimum requirement for a reasonable search permitted by the Constitution\"). [ Footnote 3/3 ]\nOur holdings that probable cause is a prerequisite to a fullscale search are based on the relationship between the two Clauses of the Fourth Amendment. The first Clause (\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . .\") states the purpose of the Amendment and its coverage. The second Clause (\". . . and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause . . .\") gives content to the word \"unreasonable\" in the first Clause.\n\"For all but . . . narrowly defined intrusions, the requisite 'balancing' has been performed in centuries of precedent and is embodied in the principle that seizures are 'reasonable' only if supported by probable cause.\"\nDunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. at 442 U. S. 214 .\nI therefore fully agree with the Court that \"the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 337 . But this \"underlying command\" is not directly interpreted in each category of cases by some amorphous \"balancing test.\" Rather, the provisions of the Warrant Clause -- a warrant and probable cause -- provide the yardstick against which official searches\nand seizures are to be measured. The Fourth Amendment neither requires nor authorizes the conceptual free-for-all that ensues when an unguided balancing test is used to assess specific categories of searches. If the search in question is more than a minimally intrusive Terry stop, the constitutional probable cause standard determines its validity.\nTo be sure, the Court recognizes that probable cause \"ordinarily\" is required to justify a full-scale search and that the existence of probable cause \"bears on\" the validity of the search. Ante at 469 U. S. 340 -341. Yet the Court fails to cite any case in which a full-scale intrusion upon privacy interests has been justified on less than probable cause. The line of cases begun by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), provides no support, for they applied a balancing test only in the context of minimally intrusive searches that served crucial law enforcement interests. The search in Terry itself, for instance, was a \"limited search of the outer clothing.\" Id. at 392 U. S. 30 . The type of border stop at issue in United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 , 422 U. S. 880 (1975), usually \"consume[d] no more than a minute\"; the Court explicitly noted that \"any further detention . . . must be based on consent or probable cause.\" Id. at 422 U. S. 882 . See also United States v. Hensley, ante at 469 U. S. 224 (momentary stop); United States v. Place, 462 U.S. at 462 U. S. 706 -707 (brief detention of luggage for canine \"sniff\"); Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106 (1977) (per curiam) (brief frisk after stop for traffic violation); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 428 U. S. 560 (1976) (characterizing intrusion as \"minimal\"); Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143 (1972) (stop and frisk). In short, all of these cases involved\n\"'seizures' so substantially less intrusive than arrests that the general rule requiring probable cause to make Fourth Amendment 'seizures' reasonable could be replaced by a balancing test.\"\nNor do the \"administrative search\" cases provide any comfort for the Court. In Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 (1967), the Court held that the probable cause standard governed even administrative searches. Although\nthe Camara Court recognized that probable cause standards themselves may have to be somewhat modified to take into account the special nature of administrative searches, the Court did so only after noting that \"because [housing code] inspections are neither personal in nature nor aimed at the discovery of evidence of crime, they involve a relatively limited invasion of the urban citizen's privacy.\" Id. at 387 U. S. 537 . Subsequent administrative search cases have similarly recognized that such searches intrude upon areas whose owners harbor a significantly decreased expectation of privacy, see, e.g., Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U. S. 594 , 452 U. S. 598 -599 (1981), thus circumscribing the injury to Fourth Amendment interests caused by the search.\nConsiderations of the deepest significance for the freedom of our citizens counsel strict adherence to the principle that no search may be conducted where the official is not in possession of probable cause that is, where the official does not know of \"facts and circumstances [that] warrant a prudent man in believing that the offense has been committed.\" Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. at 361 U. S. 102 ; see also id. at 361 U. S. 100 -101 (discussing history of probable cause standard). The Fourth Amendment was designed not merely to protect against official intrusions whose social utility was less as measured by some \"balancing test\" than its intrusion on individual privacy; it was designed in addition to grant the individual a zone of privacy whose protections could be breached only where the \"reasonable\" requirements of the probable cause standard were met. Moved by whatever momentary evil has aroused their fears, officials -- perhaps even supported by a majority of citizens -- may be tempted to conduct searches that sacrifice the liberty of each citizen to assuage the perceived evil. [ Footnote 3/4 ] But the Fourth Amendment\nrests on the principle that a true balance between the individual and society depends on the recognition of \"the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.\" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , 277 U. S. 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). That right protects the privacy and security of the individual unless the authorities can cross a specific threshold of need, designated by the term \"probable cause.\" I cannot agree with the Court's assertions today that a \"balancing test\" can replace the constitutional threshold with one that is more convenient for those enforcing the laws but less protective of the citizens' liberty; the Fourth Amendment's protections should not be defaced by\n\"a balancing process that overwhelms the individual's protection against unwarranted official intrusion by a governmental interest said to justify the search and seizure.\"\nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, supra, at 428 U. S. 570 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).\n2\nI thus do not accept the majority's premise that\n\"[t]o hold that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities is only to begin the inquiry into the standards governing such searches.\"\nAnte at 469 U. S. 337 . For me, the finding that the Fourth Amendment applies, coupled with the observation that what is at issue is a full-scale search, is the end of the inquiry. But even if I believed that a \"balancing test\" appropriately replaces the judgment of the Framers of the Fourth Amendment, I would nonetheless object to the cursory and shortsighted \"test\" that the Court employs to justify its predictable weakening of Fourth Amendment protections. In particular, the test employed by the Court vastly overstates the social costs that a probable cause standard entails and, though it plausibly articulates the serious privacy interests at stake, inexplicably fails to accord them adequate weight in striking the balance.\nThe Court begins to articulate its \"balancing test\" by observing that \"the government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order\" is to be weighed on one side of the balance. Ibid. Of course, this is not correct. It is not the government's need for effective enforcement methods that should weigh in the balance, for ordinary Fourth Amendment standards -- including probable cause.-- may well permit methods for maintaining the public order that are perfectly effective. If that were the case, the governmental interest in having effective standards would carry no weight at all as a justification for departing from the probable cause standard. Rather, it is the costs of applying probable cause as opposed to applying some lesser standard that should be weighed on the government's side. [ Footnote 3/5 ]\nIn order to tote up the costs of applying the probable-cause standard, it is thus necessary first to take into account the nature and content of that standard, and the likelihood that it would hamper achievement of the goal -- vital not just to \"teachers and administrators,\" see ante at 469 U. S. 339 -- of maintaining an effective educational setting in the public schools. The seminal statement concerning the nature of the probable cause standard is found in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925). Carroll held that law enforcement authorities have probable cause to search where\n\"the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to\nwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\"\nthat a criminal offense had occurred. Id. at 267 U. S. 162 . In Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160 (1949), the Court amplified this requirement, holding that probable cause depends upon \"the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\" Id. at 338 U. S. 175 .\nTwo Terms ago, in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213 (1983), this Court expounded at some length its view of the probable cause standard. Among the adjectives used to describe the standard were \"practical,\" \"fluid,\" \"flexible,\" \"easily applied,\" and \"nontechnical.\" See id. at 462 U. S. 232 , 462 U. S. 236 , 462 U. S. 239 . The probable cause standard was to be seen as a \"common-sense\" test whose application depended on an evaluation of the \"totality of the circumstances.\" Id. at 462 U. S. 238 .\nIgnoring what Gates took such great pains to emphasize, the Court today holds that a new \"reasonableness\" standard is appropriate because it\n\"will spare teachers and school administrators the necessity of schooling themselves in the niceties of probable cause and permit them to regulate their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense.\"\nAnte at 469 U. S. 343 . I had never thought that our pre- Gates understanding of probable cause defied either reason or common sense. But after Gates, I would have thought that there could be no doubt that this \"nontechnical,\" \"practical,\" and \"easily applied\" concept was eminently serviceable in a context like a school, where teachers require the flexibility to respond quickly and decisively to emergencies.\nA consideration of the likely operation of the probable cause standard reinforces this conclusion. Discussing the issue of school searches, Professor LaFave has noted that the cases that have reached the appellate courts\n\"strongly suggest that in most instances the evidence of wrong-doing prompting teachers or principals to conduct searches is sufficiently detailed and specific to meet the traditional probable cause test.\"\n3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 10.11,\npp. 459-460 (1978). [ Footnote 3/6 ] The problems that have caused this Court difficulty in interpreting the probable cause standard have largely involved informants, see, e.g., Illinois v. Gates, supra; Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410 (1969); Agilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108 (1964); Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307 (1959). However, three factors make it likely that problems involving informants will not make it difficult for teachers and school administrators to make probable cause decisions. This Court's decision in Gates applying a \"totality of the circumstances\" test to determine whether an informant's tip can constitute probable cause renders the test easy for teachers to apply. The fact that students and teachers interact daily in the school building makes it more likely that teachers will get to know students who supply information; the problem of informants who remain anonymous even to the teachers -- and who are therefore unavailable for verification or further questioning -- is unlikely to arise. Finally, teachers can observe the behavior of students under suspicion to corroborate any doubtful tips they do receive.\nAs compared with the relative ease with which teachers can apply the probable cause standard, the amorphous \"reasonableness under all the circumstances\" standard freshly coined by the Court today will likely spawn increased litigation and greater uncertainty among teachers and administrators. Of course, as this Court should know, an essential purpose of developing and articulating legal norms is to enable individuals to conform their conduct to those norms. A school system conscientiously attempting to obey the Fourth Amendment's dictates under a probable cause standard could, for example, consult decisions and other legal materials and prepare a booklet expounding the rough outlines of the concept. Such a booklet could be distributed to\nteachers to provide them with guidance as to when a search may be lawfully conducted. I cannot but believe that the same school system faced with interpreting what is permitted under the Court's new \"reasonableness\" standard would be hopelessly adrift as to when a search may be permissible. The sad result of this uncertainty may well be that some teachers will be reluctant to conduct searches that are fully permissible and even necessary under the constitutional probable cause standard, while others may intrude arbitrarily and unjustifiably on the privacy of students. [ Footnote 3/7 ]\nOne further point should be taken into account when considering the desirability of replacing the constitutional probable cause standard. The question facing the Court is not whether the probable cause standard should be replaced by a test of \"reasonableness under all the circumstances.\" Rather, it is whether traditional Fourth Amendment standards should recede before the Court's new standard. Thus, although the Court today paints with a broad brush and holds its undefined \"reasonableness\" standard applicable to all school searches, I would approach the question with considerably more reserve. I would not think it necessary to develop a single standard to govern all school searches, any more\nthan traditional Fourth Amendment law applies even the probable cause standard to all searches and seizures. For instance, just as police officers may conduct a brief stop and frisk on something less than probable cause, so too should teachers be permitted the same flexibility. A teacher or administrator who had reasonable suspicion that a student was carrying a gun would no doubt have authority under ordinary Fourth Amendment doctrine to conduct a limited search of the student to determine whether the threat was genuine. The \"costs\" of applying the traditional probable cause standard must therefore be discounted by the fact that, where additional flexibility is necessary and where the intrusion is minor, traditional Fourth Amendment jurisprudence itself displaces probable cause when it determines the validity of a search.\nA legitimate balancing test whose function was something more substantial than reaching a predetermined conclusion acceptable to this Court's impressions of what authority teachers need would therefore reach rather a different result than that reached by the Court today. On one side of the balance would be the costs of applying traditional Fourth Amendment standards -- the \"practical\" and \"flexible\" probable cause standard where a full-scale intrusion is sought, a lesser standard in situations where the intrusion is much less severe and the need for greater authority compelling. Whatever costs were toted up on this side would have to be discounted by the costs of applying an unprecedented and ill-defined \"reasonableness under all the circumstances\" test that will leave teachers and administrators uncertain as to their authority and will encourage excessive fact-based litigation.\nOn the other side of the balance would be the serious privacy interests of the student, interests that the Court admirably articulates in its opinion, ante at 469 U. S. 337 -339, but which the Court's new ambiguous standard places in serious jeopardy. I have no doubt that a fair assessment of the two\nsides of the balance would necessarily reach the same conclusion that, as I have argued above, the Fourth Amendment's language compels -- that school searches like that conducted in this case are valid only if supported by probable cause.\nII\nApplying the constitutional probable cause standard to the facts of this case, I would find that Mr. Choplick's search violated T.L.O.'s Fourth Amendment rights. After escorting T.L.O. into his private office, Mr. Choplick demanded to see her purse. He then opened the purse to find evidence of whether she had been smoking in the bathroom. When he opened the purse, he discovered the pack of cigarettes. At this point, his search for evidence of the smoking violation was complete.\nMr. Choplick then noticed, below the cigarettes, a pack of cigarette rolling papers. Believing that such papers were \"associated,\" see ante at 469 U. S. 328 , with the use of marihuana, he proceeded to conduct a detailed examination of the contents of her purse, in which he found some marihuana, a pipe, some money, an index card, and some private letters indicating that T.L.O. had sold marihuana to other students. The State sought to introduce this latter material in evidence at a criminal proceeding, and the issue before the Court is whether it should have been suppressed.\nOn my view of the case, we need not decide whether the initial search conducted by Mr. Choplick -- the search for evidence of the smoking violation that was completed when Mr. Choplick found the pack of cigarettes -- was valid. For Mr. Choplick at that point did not have probable cause to continue to rummage through T.L.O.'s purse. Mr. Choplick's suspicion of marihuana possession at this time was based solely on the presence of the package of cigarette papers. The mere presence without more of such a staple item of commerce is insufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in inferring both that T.L.O. had violated the law\nby possessing marihuana and that evidence of that violation would be found in her purse. Just as a police officer could not obtain a warrant to search a home based solely on his claim that he had seen a package of cigarette papers in that home, Mr. Choplick was not entitled to search possibly the most private possessions of T.L.O. based on the mere presence of a package of cigarette papers. Therefore, the fruits of this illegal search must be excluded and the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed.\nIII\nIn the past several Terms, this Court has produced a succession of Fourth Amendment opinions in which \"balancing tests\" have been applied to resolve various questions concerning the proper scope of official searches. The Court has begun to apply a \"balancing test\" to determine whether a particular category of searches intrudes upon expectations of privacy that merit Fourth Amendment protection. See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 , 468 U. S. 527 (1984) (\"Determining whether an expectation of privacy is legitimate' or `reasonable' necessarily entails a balancing of interests\"). It applies a \"balancing test\" to determine whether a warrant is necessary to conduct a search. See ante at 469 U. S. 340 ; United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at 428 U. S. 564 -566. In today's opinion, it employs a \"balancing test\" to determine what standard should govern the constitutionality of a given category of searches. See ante at 469 U. S. 340 -341. Should a search turn out to be unreasonable after application of all of these \"balancing tests,\" the Court then applies an additional \"balancing test\" to decide whether the evidence resulting from the search must be excluded. See United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984).\nAll of these \"balancing tests\" amount to brief nods by the Court in the direction of a neutral utilitarian calculus while the Court in fact engages in an unanalyzed exercise of judicial will. Perhaps this doctrinally destructive nihilism is merely\na convenient umbrella under which a majority that cannot agree on a genuine rationale can conceal its differences. Compare ante p. 469 U. S. 327 (WHITE, J., delivering the opinion of the Court), with ante p. 469 U. S. 348 (POWELL, J., joined by O'CONNOR, J., concurring), and ante p. 469 U. S. 351 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment). And it may be that the real force underlying today's decision is the belief that the Court purports to reject -- the belief that the unique role served by the schools justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment on their behalf. If so, the methodology of today's decision may turn out to have as little influence in future cases as will its result, and the Court's departure from traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine will be confined to the schools.\nOn my view, the presence of the word \"unreasonable\" in the text of the Fourth Amendment does not grant a shifting majority of this Court the authority to answer all Fourth Amendment questions by consulting its momentary vision of the social good. Full-scale searches unaccompanied by probable cause violate the Fourth Amendment. I do not pretend that our traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine automatically answers all of the difficult legal questions that occasionally arise. I do contend, however, that this Court has an obligation to provide some coherent framework to resolve such questions on the basis of more than a conclusory recitation of the results of a \"balancing test.\" The Fourth Amendment itself supplies that framework and, because the Court today fails to heed its message, I must respectfully dissent.\nA purse typically contains items of highly personal nature. Especially for shy or sensitive adolescents, it could prove extremely embarrassing for a teacher or principal to rummage through its contents, which could include notes from friends, fragments of love poems, caricatures of school authorities, and items of personal hygiene.\nAdministrative search cases involving inspection schemes have recognized that\n\"if inspection is to be effective and serve as a credible deterrent, unannounced, even frequent, inspections are essential. In this context, the prerequisite of a warrant could easily frustrate inspection. . . .\"\nIn fact, despite the somewhat diminished expectation of privacy that this Court has recognized in the automobile context, see South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364 , 428 U. S. 367 -368 (1976), we have required probable cause even to justify a warrantless automobile search, see United States v. Ortiz, 422 U. S. 891 , 422 U. S. 896 (1975) (\"A search, even of an automobile, is a substantial invasion of privacy. To protect that privacy from official arbitrariness, the Court always has regarded probable cause as the minimum requirement for a lawful search\") (footnote omitted); Chamers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. at 399 U. S. 51 .\nAs Justice Stewart said in Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 , 403 U. S. 455 (1971):\n\"In times of unrest, whether caused by crime or racial conflict or fear of internal subversion this basic law and the values that it represents may appear unrealistic or 'extravagant' to some. But the values were those of the authors of our fundamental constitutional concepts.\"\nI speak of the \"government's side\" only because it is the terminology used by the Court. In my view, this terminology itself is seriously misleading. The government is charged with protecting the privacy and security of the citizen, just as it is charged with apprehending those who violate the criminal law. Consequently, the government has no legitimate interest in conducting a search that unduly intrudes on the privacy and security of the citizen. The balance is not between the rights of the government and the rights of the citizen, but between opposing conceptions of the constitutionally legitimate means of carrying out the government's varied responsibilities.\nIt should be noted that Professor LaFave reached this conclusion in 1978, before this Court's decision in Gates made clear the \"flexibility\" of the probable cause concept.\nA comparison of the language of the standard (\"reasonableness under all the circumstances\") with the traditional language of probable cause (\"facts sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that a crime had been committed and the evidence would be found in the designated place\") suggests that the Court's new standard may turn out to be probable cause under a new guise. If so, the additional uncertainty caused by this Court's innovation is surely unjustifiable; it would be naive to expect that the addition of this extra dose of uncertainty would do anything other than \"burden the efforts of school authorities to maintain order in their schools,\" ante at 469 U. S. 342 . If, on the other hand, the new standard permits searches of students in instances when probable cause is absent -- instances, according to this Court's consistent formulations, when a person of reasonable caution would not think it likely that a violation existed or that evidence of that violation would be found -- the new standard is genuinely objectionable and impossible to square with the premise that our citizens have the right to be free from arbitrary intrusions on their privacy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, and with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins as to Part I, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nAssistant Vice Principal Choplick searched T.L.O.'s purse for evidence that she was smoking in the girls' restroom. Because T.L.O.'s suspected misconduct was not illegal and did not pose a serious threat to school discipline, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that Choplick's search\nof her purse was an unreasonable invasion of her privacy and that the evidence which he seized could not be used against her in criminal proceedings. The New Jersey court's holding was a careful response to the case it was required to decide.\nThe State of New Jersey sought review in this Court, first arguing that the exclusionary rule is wholly inapplicable to searches conducted by school officials, and then contending that the Fourth Amendment itself provides no protection at all to the student's privacy. The Court has accepted neither of these frontal assaults on the Fourth Amendment. It has, however, seized upon this \"no smoking\" case to announce \"the proper standard\" that should govern searches by school officials who are confronted with disciplinary problems far more severe than smoking in the restroom. Although I join Part 469 U. S. I continue to believe that the Court has unnecessarily and inappropriately reached out to decide a constitutional question. See 468 U. S. 1214 (1984) (STEVENS, J., dissenting from reargument order). More importantly, I fear that the concerns that motivated the Court's activism have produced a holding that will permit school administrators to search students suspected of violating only the most trivial school regulations and guidelines for behavior.\nI\nThe question the Court decides today -- whether Mr. Choplick's search of T.L.O.'s purse violated the Fourth Amendment -- was not raised by the State's petition for writ of certiorari. That petition only raised one question: \"Whether the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule applies to searches made by public school officials and teachers in school.\" [ Footnote 4/1 ] The State quite properly declined to submit the former question because \"[it] did not wish to present what might appear to be solely a factual dispute to this Court.\" [ Footnote 4/2 ]\nSince this Court has twice had the threshold question argued, I believe that it should expressly consider the merits of the New Jersey Supreme Court's ruling that the exclusionary rule applies.\nThe New Jersey Supreme Court's holding on this question is plainly correct. As the state court noted, this case does not involve the use of evidence in a school disciplinary proceeding; the juvenile proceedings brought against T.L.O. involved a charge that would have been a criminal offense if committed by an adult. [ Footnote 4/3 ] Accordingly, the exclusionary rule issue decided by that court and later presented to this Court concerned only the use in a criminal proceeding of evidence obtained in a search conducted by a public school administrator.\nHaving confined the issue to the law enforcement context, the New Jersey court then reasoned that this Court's cases have made it quite clear that the exclusionary rule is equally applicable\n\"whether the public official who illegally obtained the evidence was a municipal inspector, See v. Seattle, 387 U. S. 541 [1967]; Camara [v. Municipal Court,] 387 U. S. 523 [1967]; a firefighter, Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499 , 436 U. S. 506 [1978]; or a school administrator or law enforcement official. [ Footnote 4/4 ]\"\nIt correctly concluded \"that, if an official search violates constitutional rights, the evidence is not admissible in criminal proceedings.\" [ Footnote 4/5 ]\nWhen a defendant in a criminal proceeding alleges that she was the victim of an illegal search by a school administrator, the application of the exclusionary rule is a simple corollary of the principle that\n\"all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court.\"\nMapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , 367 U. S. 655 (1961). The practical basis for this principle is, in part, its deterrent effect, see id. at 367 U. S. 656 , and as a general\nmatter it is tolerably clear to me, as it has been to the Court, that the existence of an exclusionary remedy does deter the authorities from violating the Fourth Amendment by sharply reducing their incentive to do so. [ Footnote 4/6 ] In the case of evidence obtained in school searches, the \"overall educative effect\" [ Footnote 4/7 ] of the exclusionary rule adds important symbolic force to this utilitarian judgment.\nJustice Brandeis was both a great student and a great teacher. It was he who wrote:\n\"Our Government is the potent, the onmipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.\"\nOlmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , 277 U. S. 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion). Those of us who revere the flag and the ideals for which it stands believe in the power of symbols. We cannot ignore that rules of law also have a symbolic power that may vastly exceed their utility.\nSchools are places where we inculcate the values essential to the meaningful exercise of rights and responsibilities by a self-governing citizenry. [ Footnote 4/8 ] If the Nation's students can be convicted through the use of arbitrary methods destructive of personal liberty, they cannot help but feel that they have\nbeen dealt with unfairly. [ Footnote 4/9 ] The application of the exclusionary rule in criminal proceedings arising from illegal school searches makes an important statement to young people that \"our society attaches serious consequences to a violation of constitutional rights,\" [ Footnote 4/10 ] and that this is a principle of \"liberty and justice for all.\" [ Footnote 4/11 ]\nThus, the simple and correct answer to the question presented by the State's petition for certiorari would have required affirmance of a state court's judgment suppressing evidence. That result would have been dramatically out of character for a Court that not only grants prosecutors relief from suppression orders with distressing regularity, [ Footnote 4/12 ] but\nalso is prone to rely on grounds not advanced by the parties in order to protect evidence from exclusion. [ Footnote 4/13 ] In characteristic disregard of the doctrine of judicial restraint, the Court avoided that result in this case by ordering reargument and directing the parties to address a constitutional question that the parties, with good reason, had not asked the Court to decide. Because judicial activism undermines the Court's power to perform its central mission in a legitimate way, I dissented from the reargument order. See 468 U. S. 1214 (1984). I have not modified the views expressed in that dissent, but since the majority has brought the question before us, I shall explain why I believe the Court has misapplied the standard of reasonableness embodied in the Fourth Amendment.\nII\nThe search of a young woman's purse by a school administrator is a serious invasion of her legitimate expectations of privacy. A purse \"is a common repository for one's personal effects and therefore is inevitably associated with the expectation of privacy.\" Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 , 442 U. S. 762 (1979). Although such expectations must sometimes yield to the legitimate requirements of government, in assessing the constitutionality of a warrantless search, our decision must be guided by the language of the Fourth Amendment: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\npapers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. . . . \" In order to evaluate the reasonableness of such searches,\n\"it is necessary 'first to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen,' for there is 'no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or seizure] entails.'\"\nThe \"limited search for weapons\" in Terry was justified by the \"immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him.\" 392 U.S. at 392 U. S. 23 , 392 U. S. 25 . When viewed from the institutional perspective, \"the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools,\" ante at 469 U. S. 341 (majority opinion), is no less acute. Violent, unlawful, or seriously disruptive conduct is fundamentally inconsistent with the principal function of teaching institutions which is to educate young people and prepare them for citizenship. [ Footnote 4/15 ] When such conduct occurs amidst a sizable group of impressionable young people, it creates an explosive atmosphere that requires a prompt and effective response.\nThus, warrantless searches of students by school administrators are reasonable when undertaken for those purposes.\nBut the majority's statement of the standard for evaluating the reasonableness of such searches is not suitably adapted to that end. The majority holds that\n\"a search of a student by a teacher or other school official will be 'justified at its inception' when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. \"\nAnte at 469 U. S. 341 -342. This standard will permit teachers and school administrators to search students when they suspect that the search will reveal evidence of even the most trivial school regulation or precatory guideline for student behavior. The Court's standard for deciding whether a search is justified \"at its inception\" treats all violations of the rules of the school as though they were fungible. For the Court, a search for curlers and sunglasses in order to enforce the school dress code [ Footnote 4/16 ] is apparently just as important as a search for evidence of heroin addiction or violent gang activity.\nThe majority, however, does not contend that school administrators have a compelling need to search students in\norder to achieve optimum enforcement of minor school regulations. [ Footnote 4/17 ] To the contrary, when minor violations are involved, there is every indication that the informal school disciplinary process, with only minimum requirements of due process, [ Footnote 4/18 ] can function effectively without the power to search for enough evidence to prove a criminal case. In arguing that teachers and school administrators need the power to search students based on a lessened standard, the United States as amicus curiae relies heavily on empirical evidence of a contemporary crisis of violence and unlawful behavior that is seriously undermining the process of education in American schools. [ Footnote 4/19 ] A standard better attuned to this concern would permit teachers and school administrators to search a student when they have reason to believe that the search will uncover evidence that the student is violating the law or engaging in conduct that is seriously disruptive of school order, or the educational process.\nThis standard is properly directed at \"[t]he sole justification for the [warrantless] search.\" [ Footnote 4/20 ] In addition, a standard\nthat varies the extent of the permissible intrusion with the gravity of the suspected offense is also more consistent with common law experience and this Court's precedent. Criminal law has traditionally recognized a distinction between essentially regulatory offenses and serious violations of the peace, and graduated the response of the criminal justice system depending on the character of the violation. [ Footnote 4/21 ] The application of a similar distinction in evaluating the reasonableness of warrantless searches and seizures \"is not a novel idea.\" Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740 , 466 U. S. 750 (1984). [ Footnote 4/22 ]\nIn Welsh, police officers arrived at the scene of a traffic accident and obtained information indicating that the driver of the automobile involved was guilty of a first offense of\ndriving while intoxicated -- a civil violation with a maximum fine of $200. The driver had left the scene of the accident, and the officers followed the suspect to his home where they arrested him without a warrant. Absent exigent circumstances, the warrantless invasion of the home was a clear violation of Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573 (1980). In holding that the warrantless arrest for the \"noncriminal, traffic offense\" in Welsh was unconstitutional, the Court noted that\n\"application of the exigent-circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned when there is probable cause to believe that only a minor offense . . . has been committed.\"\n466 U.S. at 466 U. S. 753 . The logic of distinguishing between minor and serious offenses in evaluating the reasonableness of school searches is almost too clear for argument. In order to justify the serious intrusion on the persons and privacy of young people that New Jersey asks this Court to approve, the State must identify \"some real immediate and serious consequences.\" McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 , 335 U. S. 460 (1948) (Jackson, J., concurring, joined by Frankfurter, J.). [ Footnote 4/23 ] While school administrators have entirely legitimate reasons for adopting school regulations and guidelines for student behavior, the authorization of searches to enforce them \"displays a shocking lack of all sense of proportion.\" Id. 335 U. S. 459 . [ Footnote 4/24 ]\nThe majority offers weak deference to these principles of balance and decency by announcing that school searches will only be reasonable in scope \"when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction. \" Ante at 469 U. S. 342 (emphasis added). The majority offers no explanation why a two-part standard is necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the ordinary school search. Significantly, in the balance of its opinion the Court pretermits any discussion of the nature of T.L.O.'s infraction of the \"no smoking\" rule.\nThe \"rider\" to the Court's standard for evaluating the reasonableness of the initial intrusion apparently is the Court's perception that its standard is overly generous and does not, by itself, achieve a fair balance between the administrator's right to search and the student's reasonable expectations of privacy. The Court's standard for evaluating the \"scope\" of reasonable school searches is obviously designed to prohibit physically intrusive searches of students by persons of the opposite sex for relatively minor offenses. The Court's effort to establish a standard that is, at once, clear enough to allow searches to be upheld in nearly every case, and flexible enough to prohibit obviously unreasonable intrusions of young adults' privacy only creates uncertainty in the extent of its resolve to prohibit the latter. Moreover, the majority's application of its standard in this case -- to permit a male administrator to rummage through the purse of a female high school student in order to obtain evidence that she was smoking\nin a bathroom -- raises grave doubts in my mind whether its effort will be effective. [ Footnote 4/25 ] Unlike the Court, I believe the nature of the suspected infraction is a matter of first importance in deciding whether any invasion of privacy is permissible.\nIII\nThe Court embraces the standard applied by the New Jersey Supreme Court as equivalent to its own, and then deprecates the state court's application of the standard as reflecting \"a somewhat crabbed notion of reasonableness.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 343 . There is no mystery, however, in the state court's finding that the search in this case was unconstitutional; the decision below was not based on a manipulation of reasonable suspicion, but on the trivial character of the activity that promoted the official search. The New Jersey Supreme Court wrote:\n\"We are satisfied that, when a school official has reasonable grounds to believe that a student possesses evidence of illegal activity or activity that would interfere with school discipline and order, the school official has the right to conduct a reasonable search for such evidence.\"\n\"In determining whether the school official has reasonable grounds, courts should consider the child's age, history, and school record, the prevalence and seriousness of the problem in the school to which the search was\ndirected, the exigency to make the search without delay, and the probative value and reliability of the information used as a justification for the search. [ Footnote 4/26 ]\"\nThe emphasized language in the state court's opinion focuses on the character of the rule infraction that is to be the object of the search.\nIn the view of the state court, there is a quite obvious and material difference between a search for evidence relating to violent or disruptive activity, and a search for evidence of a smoking rule violation. This distinction does not imply that a no-smoking rule is a matter of minor importance. Rather, like a rule that prohibits a student from being tardy, its occasional violation in a context that poses no threat of disrupting school order and discipline offers no reason to believe that an immediate search is necessary to avoid unlawful conduct, violence, or a serious impairment of the educational process.\nA correct understanding of the New Jersey court's standard explains why that court concluded in T.L.O.'s case that\n\"the assistant principal did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the student was concealing in her purse evidence of criminal activity or evidence of activity that would seriously interfere with school discipline or order. [ Footnote 4/27 ]\"\nThe importance of the nature of the rule infraction to the New Jersey Supreme Court's holding is evident from its brief explanation of the principal basis for its decision:\n\"A student has an expectation of privacy in the contents of her purse. Mere possession of cigarettes did not violate school rule or policy, since the school allowed smoking in designated areas. The contents of the handbag had no direct bearing on the infraction.\"\n\"The assistant principal's desire, legal in itself, to gather evidence to impeach the student's credibility at a\nhearing on the disciplinary infraction does not validate the search. [ Footnote 4/28 ]\"\nLike the New Jersey Supreme Court, I would view this case differently if the Assistant Vice Principal had reason to believe T.L.O.'s purse contained evidence of criminal activity, or of an activity that would seriously disrupt school discipline. There was, however, absolutely no basis for any such assumption -- not even a \"hunch.\"\nIn this case, Mr. Choplick overreacted to what appeared to be nothing more than a minor infraction -- a rule prohibiting smoking in the bathroom of the freshmen's and sophomores' building. [ Footnote 4/29 ] It is, of course, true that he actually found evidence of serious wrongdoing by T.L.O., but no one claims that the prior search may be justified by his unexpected discovery. As far as the smoking infraction is concerned, the search for cigarettes merely tended to corroborate a teacher's eyewitness account of T.L.O.'s violation of a minor regulation designed to channel student smoking behavior into designated locations. Because this conduct was neither unlawful nor significantly disruptive of school order or the educational process, the invasion of privacy associated with the forcible opening of T.L.O.'s purse was entirely unjustified at its inception.\nA review of the sampling of school search cases relied on by the Court demonstrates how different this case is from those\nin which there was indeed a valid justification for intruding on a student's privacy. In most of them the student was suspected of a criminal violation; [ Footnote 4/30 ] in the remainder either violence or substantial disruption of school order or the integrity of the academic process was at stake. [ Footnote 4/31 ] Few involved matters as trivial as the no-smoking rule violated by T.L.0., [ Footnote 4/32 ] The rule the Court adopts today is so open-ended that it may make the Fourth Amendment virtually meaningless in the school context. Although I agree that school administrators must have broad latitude to maintain order and discipline in our classrooms, that authority is not unlimited.\nIV\nThe schoolroom is the first opportunity most citizens have to experience the power of government. Through it passes every citizen and public official, from schoolteachers to\npolicemen and prison guards. The values they learn there, they take with them in life. One of our most cherished ideals is the one contained in the Fourth Amendment: that the government may not intrude on the personal privacy of its citizens without a warrant or compelling circumstance. The Court's decision today is a curious moral for the Nation's youth. Although the search of T.L.O.'s purse does not trouble today's majority, I submit that we are not dealing with \"matters relatively trivial to the welfare of the Nation. There are village tyrants as well as village Hampdens, but none who acts under color of law is beyond reach of the Constitution.\" West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.

See generally W. LaFave, Handbook on Criminal Law § 6 (1972).\nSome codes of student behavior also provide a system of graduated response by distinguishing between violent, unlawful, or seriously disruptive conduct, and conduct that will only warrant serious sanctions when the student engages in repetitive offenses. See, e.g., Parent-Student Handbook of Piscataway [N.J.] H.S. (1979), Record Doc. S-1, pp. 15-16; Student Handbook of South Windsor [Conn.] H.S. � E (1984); Rules of the Board of Education of the District of Columbia, Ch. IV, §§ 431.1-.10 (1982). Indeed, at Piscataway High School a violation of smoking regulations that is \"[a] student's first offense will result in assignment of up to three (3) days of after school classes concerning hazards of smoking.\" Record Doc. S-1, supra, at 15.\nIn Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 582 -583 (emphasis added), the Court noted that similar considerations require some variance in the requirements of due process in the school disciplinary context:\n\"[A]s a general rule notice and hearing should precede removal of the student from school. We agree . . ., however, that there are recurring situations in which prior notice and hearing cannot be insisted upon. Students whose presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process may be immediately removed from school. In such cases the necessary notice and rudimentary hearing should follow as soon as practicable. . . .\"\nIn McDonald police officers made a warrantless search of the office of an illegal \"numbers\" operation. Justice Jackson rejected the view that the search could be supported by exigent circumstances:\n\"Even if one were to conclude that urgent circumstances might justify a forced entry without a warrant, no such emergency was present in this case. . . . Whether there is reasonable necessity for a search without waiting to obtain a warrant certainly depends somewhat upon the gravity of the offense thought to be in progress as well as the hazards of the method of attempting to reach it. . . . [The defendant's] criminal operation, while a shabby swindle that the police are quite right in suppressing, was not one which endangered life or limb or the peace and good order of the community. . . .\"\n335 U.S. at 335 U. S. 459 -460.\nWhile a policeman who sees a person smoking in an elevator in violation of a city ordinance may conduct a full-blown search for evidence of the smoking violation in the unlikely event of a custodial arrest, United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 , 414 U. S. 236 (1973); Gustafson v. Florida, 414 U. S. 260 , 414 U. S. 265 -266 (1973), it is more doubtful whether a search of this kind would be reasonable if the officer only planned to issue a citation to the offender and depart, see Robinson, 414 U.S. at 414 U. S. 236 , n. 6. In any case, the majority offers no rationale supporting its conclusion that a student detained by school officials for questioning, on reasonable suspicion that she has violated a school rule, is entitled to no more protection under the Fourth Amendment than a criminal suspect under custodial arrest.\nOne thing is clear under any standard -- the shocking strip searches that are described in some cases have no place in the schoolhouse. See Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F.2d 91, 92-93 (CA7 1980) (\"It does not require a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude search of a 13-year-old child is an invasion of constitutional rights of some magnitude\"), cert. denied 451 U.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Defibrillators are meant to \"reset\" a heart during fibrillation, not once it has completely flatlined.", "reference_documents": ["Everyone knows that what we see in Hollywood isn’t always the truth. In most cases, movie directors and producers will thoroughly study an area before filming it. But, there are still times when the movies don’t have it quite right. In particular, there are a number of films that depict using an AED, and it isn’t completely accurate. Here are 5 movies with AEDs, and why using an AED doesn’t work like that.\nCasino Royale\nAfter James Bond has shared drinks with some unfriendly men, it becomes apparent that he has been poisoned. He rushes back to his car, informing his team that he is about to go into cardiac arrest. His team then instructs him to pull out the AED from his car and apply the pads to his chest – as using an AED is the only way to save him. But because the AED only has one charge, they need to time it perfectly. Then as Bond slowly fades, he tries pressing the button but no shock is administered. He realizes that the wire has fallen out of the AED pad – but it is too late and he crashes. Thankfully, a woman comes to the rescue, reattaches the wire to the AED pad, and administers the shock. Bond jumps to a start and regains consciousness.Why it Doesn’t Work Like That:\n- The AED\n- Every AED is easy to use and each step is clearly laid out and explained through images and voice activated instructions. This very strange looking AED of Bond’s has a small hidden compartment that holds the AED pads. In addition, the AED only has a single button on the whole device that is used to administer a single shock (not clearly identified). If it were not for Bond’s fellow agents, how would he have known what to do? This AED is clearly not easy to use!\n- The AED Pads\n- The main reason this scene is not plausible is because of the AED pads. These pads are only connected to the AED through flimsy wires. The wires are obviously not properly secured to the AED or pads. In the short time that Bond works to apply the pads, somehow the wires become detached – a life-threatening problem! The AEDs used today do not have wires that can fall off of the pad, as they are securely fastened to the pad.\n- The Shock\n- In reality, a person suffering cardiac arrest may need a number of shocks before coming to consciousness. In this scene, Bond receives one shock that requires a long charge time, but wakes him up instantly. The reason why using an AED doesn’t work like that, is because an AED should not take so long to charge up, and should be capable of multiple charges with one battery (during one emergency situation)! In most instances, if an AED took that long, the person would most likely be lost before they could get the assistance they need. Secondly, bond would not be able to push the button himself as the AED would normally scan for a heard in fibrillation (which his would not have been yet) and would therefore not shock – as a safety for those with healthy hearts).\nE.T.\nIn this scene, E.T. has been recently found in the forest, dying, and is brought to the home of Elliot. Scientists have invaded the home cutting of E.T.’s link with Elliot. Now that the link has been severed, Elliot begins to recover while E.T. continues steadily towards death. Tons of scientists and doctors crowd around E.T., working to revive him and save his life. Eventually one doctor suggests the use of the defibrillator. The doctors pull out a medical AED and administer a loud shock to E.T. They continue to perform CPR but it is to no avail. The doctors call it, announcing the time of death, leaving a heartbroken Elliot. Spoilers: E.T. is not dead!Why It Doesn’t Work Like That\n- The Doctors\n- In the movie, it is only after much discussion and attempted CPR that the doctors decide to finally administer a shock. In real life, if someone goes into cardiac arrest, the sooner you can attach an AED to them, the more likely they are going to survive. These doctors spent too much time discussing methods of treatment and instead should have brought over the AED immediately.\n- The Shock\n- In this scene, when the shock is administered to E.T., the doctors stand back and watch his body jump into the air and a loud sound is heard. Today’s AEDs will not have a sound like this, nor will it be so strong as to jump a body off the ground. Often, the only sound heard is a small zap. What is worse, is that even though E.T. does not respond to the first loud shock, they do not give further shocks. When using an AED, it is common for the machine to analyze and suggest multiple shock administrations when needed. These shocks are meant to regulate the heart back into rhythm, not simply a last-resort option.\nDoctor Strange\nSomething bad has happened to Stephen Strange and he has been wounded by an un-worldly weapon. He has transported himself to the hospital where he becomes unconscious. It is only through his ‘astral projection’ (out-of-body experiences) that he is able to speak with Dr. Palmer to help her properly fix him. Unfortunately, there are villains out to get Stephen and they come to the hospital and battle him in the astral realm. When Stephen’s heart stops, Dr. Palmer brings out an AED and administers a shock. She gets his heart beating once more, but Stephen comes through the astral realm and tells Dr. Palmer to “hit him again.” Using an AED shock, he is able to defeat his foe in the astral realm. Then Stephen returns to his body and awakes.Why It Doesn’t Work Like That\n- Stephen’s Heart\n- As in most movies it shows a flatline. However, defibrillators are meant to ‘reset’ a heart during fibrillation, not once completely flat-lined. Even if his heart was only in fibrillation, once Dr. Palmer got his heart beating again, another extra shock is not advised! This could cause further damage to the individual or even stop the heart again.\nThe Abyss\nBud and Lindsey are trapped underneath their boat and the water is slowly rising. There is only one scuba-diving suit and two of them. Lindsey then comes up with the idea of allowing herself to drown in the freezing water, while Bud wears the suit and brings her back to the station. There, she identifies, they can resuscitate her back to life. Bud agrees after much protest, and soon enough Lindsey has drowned and Bud swims her back to the station. He notifies the team ahead through radio that they will need to resuscitate Lindsey, so they bring out the AED. A few shocks are administered to no avail, and one of the team members announces that she has flat-lined. Bud refuses to quit and begins to perform CPR, giving a breath after every 5 compressions. After they announce there is no pulse, Bud then begins to violently compress Lindsey, yelling at her to fight. Suddenly, Lindsey coughs and comes back to life.\n- Deprived from Oxygen\n- Although Lindsey thinks that it will be no problem to resuscitate her, suggesting that the ice water will help freeze her blood – this is not true. Lindsey has still technically “drowned” and her brain has been deprived of oxygen for far too long. Bud tries to swim as fast as he can to get her to the station, but the fact is that the film makes it appear that it took a long time to get back. Every minute without oxygen is one step closer to death.\n- AED location\n- In the scene where they bring out the AED, the first individual is unsure how to use it. They first put the pads on top of her clothes, someone corrects the placement, putting them on her skin instead. The problem with this scene is not the pad placement, but the fact that Bud and Lindsey were just pulled out of the water and should be drenched. Not to mention, they are giving the shocks on the water’s edge. This could be very dangerous if too much water was in contact with the machine. It is always necessary that you dry off the individual as much as possible before administering shocks!\n- CPR Compressions\n- In the scene, Bud is giving a breath for every 5 compressions – this is not correct. The proper way to conduct CPR is to give 2 breaths for every 30 compressions. Though we are impressed that he knows to lift her chin when administering breaths!\nLockout\nSnow enters the scene and finds a young woman on the ground unconscious with a hole in her leg. Through an earpiece, an agent guides him through how to assist the woman. He instructs Snow to open the ‘medi-pack’ and get the ‘defib-kit.’ With only 15 seconds, he has to gel the two small pads, place them on her chest and make sure they stick. Then, using the AED, he administers a shock using a small box. The agent tells Snow that he was able to get a pulse but he now needs to give an injection of serotonin and norepinephrine. The problem is that he needs to inject it through the center of her right eye into her brain. After doing this with much hesitation, and another shock to the heart, the young woman begins to seize. Once she stops seizing, the agent rushes Snow, telling him to give her mouth to mouth. He gives the woman two breaths before she wakes up, pushing Snow off of her in disgust.Why It Doesn’t Work Like That\n- The AED\n- Although the film is set in the future, it can still be understood that this AED is much different than ones we use today. This defibrillator has no pad storage option, no buttons (except a small moveable button on the side), and no voice activated instructions. If it were not for the agent in his earpiece, Snow would not have known what to do to revive the woman. And as much as we’d like to think it all worked that fast, that shock was in record time.\n- The Pad Placement\n- If you watch carefully in the video, Snow places the two pads on her chest, one near her armpit and the other closer to her collar bone. This placement is not going to be effective as the shocks are not properly reaching her heart. Instead, the pads should be placed 1) just on the right side of the chest and 2) on the left side of the body over the ribs. This placement is necessary for the shock to make its way through heart.\n- The shock\n- Again, the body does not shoot off the ground like that after a sock.\nWith all of these errors in movies it would seem that using an AED is difficult. But it isn’t! These films use strange, and often unrealistic AEDs that would not actually work. Using an AED is easy, and with the help of images, labeled buttons, and voice activated instructions, anyone can assist a person experiencing a cardiac arrest."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

While the deep web is a reference to any site that cannot be accessed by a traditional search engine, the dark web is a portion of the deep web that has been hidden intentionally and is inaccessible by standard browsers and methods. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]\nBergman, in a paper on the deep web published in The Journal of Electronic Publishing , mentioned that Jill Ellsworth used the term Invisible Web in 1994 to refer to websites that were not registered with any search engine. [19] Bergman cited a January 1996 article by Frank Garcia: [20]\nIt would be a site that's possibly reasonably designed, but they didn't bother to register it with any of the search engines. So, no one can find them! You're hidden. I call that the invisible Web.\nAnother early use of the term Invisible Web was by Bruce Mount and Matthew B. Koll of Personal Library Software , in a description of the No. 1 Deep Web program found in a December 1996 press release. [21]\nThe first use of the specific term deep web , now generally accepted, occurred in the aforementioned 2001 Bergman study. [19]\nMethods that prevent web pages from being indexed by traditional search engines may be categorized as one or more of the following:\n- Contextual web : pages with content varying for different access contexts (e.g., ranges of client IP addresses or previous navigation sequence).\n- Dynamic content : dynamic pages , which are returned in response to a submitted query or accessed only through a form, especially if open-domain input elements (such as text fields) are used; such fields are hard to navigate without domain knowledge .\n- Limited access content : sites that limit access to their pages in a technical manner (e.g., using the Robots Exclusion Standard or CAPTCHAs , or no-store directive, which prohibit search engines from browsing them and creating cached copies). [22] Sites may feature an internal search engine for exploring such pages. [23] [24]\n- Non-HTML/text content : textual content encoded in multimedia (image or video) files or specific file formats not recognised by search engines.\n- Private web : sites that require registration and login (password-protected resources).\n- Scripted content : pages that are accessible only by links produced by JavaScript as well as content dynamically downloaded from Web servers via Flash or Ajax solutions.\n- Software : certain content is hidden intentionally from the regular Internet, accessible only with special software, such as Tor , I2P , or other darknet software. For example, Tor allows users to access websites using the .onion server address anonymously, hiding their IP address.\n- Unlinked content : pages which are not linked to by other pages, which may prevent web crawling programs from accessing the content. This content is referred to as pages without backlinks (also known as inlinks). Also, search engines do not always detect all backlinks from searched web pages.\n- Web archives : Web archival services such as the Wayback Machine enable users to see archived versions of web pages across time, including websites that have become inaccessible and are not indexed by search engines such as Google. The Wayback Machine may be termed a program for viewing the deep web, as web archives that are not from the present cannot be indexed, as past versions of websites are impossible to view by a search. All websites are updated at some time, which is why web archives are considered Deep Web content. [25]\nWhile it is not always possible to discover directly a specific web server's content so that it may be indexed, a site potentially can be accessed indirectly (due to computer vulnerabilities ).\nTo discover content on the web, search engines use web crawlers that follow hyperlinks through known protocol virtual port numbers . This technique is ideal for discovering content on the surface web but is often ineffective at finding deep web content. For example, these crawlers do not attempt to find dynamic pages that are the result of database queries due to the indeterminate number of queries that are possible. [26] It has been noted that this can be overcome (partially) by providing links to query results, but this could unintentionally inflate the popularity of a site of the deep web.\nDeepPeep , Intute , Deep Web Technologies , Scirus , and Ahmia.fi are a few search engines that have accessed the deep web. Intute ran out of funding and is now a temporary static archive as of July 2011. [27] Scirus retired near the end of January 2013. [28]\nResearchers have been exploring how the deep web can be crawled in an automatic fashion, including content that can be accessed only by special software such as Tor . In 2001, Sriram Raghavan and Hector Garcia-Molina (Stanford Computer Science Department, Stanford University) [29] [30] presented an architectural model for a hidden-Web crawler that used important terms provided by users or collected from the query interfaces to query a Web form and crawl the Deep Web content. Alexandros Ntoulas, Petros Zerfos, and Junghoo Cho of UCLA created a hidden-Web crawler that automatically generated meaningful queries to issue against search forms. [31] Several form query languages (e.g., DEQUEL [32] ) have been proposed that, besides issuing a query, also allow extraction of structured data from result pages. Another effort is DeepPeep, a project of the University of Utah sponsored by the National Science Foundation , which gathered hidden-web sources (web forms) in different domains based on novel focused crawler techniques. [33] [34]\nCommercial search engines have begun exploring alternative methods to crawl the deep web. The Sitemap Protocol (first developed, and introduced by Google in 2005) and OAI-PMH are mechanisms that allow search engines and other interested parties to discover deep web resources on particular web servers. Both mechanisms allow web servers to advertise the URLs that are accessible on them, thereby allowing automatic discovery of resources that are not linked directly to the surface web. Google's deep web surfacing system computes submissions for each HTML form and adds the resulting HTML pages into the Google search engine index. The surfaced results account for a thousand queries per second to deep web content. [35] In this system, the pre-computation of submissions is done using three algorithms:\n- selecting input values for text search inputs that accept keywords,\n- identifying inputs that accept only values of a specific type (e.g., date) and\n- selecting a small number of input combinations that generate URLs suitable for inclusion into the Web search index.\nIn 2008, to facilitate users of Tor hidden services in their access and search of a hidden .onion suffix, Aaron Swartz designed Tor2web —a proxy application able to provide access by means of common web browsers. [36] Using this application, deep web links appear as a random sequence of letters followed by the .onion top-level domain ."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

With a diameter of about 90 meters (300 feet), Grand Prismatic Spring is the largest hot spring in the United States. Gallons of water evaporate, or turn from liquid to gas, every day at the spring. Steam is not water vapor, however. Steam is the wet mist that forms above boiling water as the hot, invisible water vapor mixes with cooler surrounding air.\nPhotograph by Christopher Zimmer, My Shot\nPhotograph\nPhotograph\nPhotograph\nPhotograph\nEvaporation happens when a liquid substance becomes a gas . When water is heated, it e vaporates . The molecules move and vibrate so quickly that they escape into the atmosphere as molecules of water vapor.\nEvaporation is a very important part of the water cycle . Heat from the sun, or solar energy , powers the evaporation process. It soaks up moisture from soil in a garden, as well as the biggest oceans and lakes. The water level will decrease as it is exposed to the heat of the sun.\nAlthough the level of a lake, pool, or glass of water will decrease due to evaporation, the escaped water molecules dont disappear . They stay in the atmosphere, affecting humidity , or the amount of moisture in the air. Areas with high temperatures and large bodies of water, such as tropical islands and swamps , are usually very humid for this reason. Water is evaporating, but staying in the air as a vapor.\nOnce water evaporates, it also helps form clouds . The clouds then release the moisture as rain or snow . The liquid water falls to Earth , waiting to be evaporated. The cycle starts all over again.\nMany factors affect how evaporation happens. If the air is already clogged, or saturated , with other substances, there wont be enough room in the air for liquid to evaporate quickly. When the humidity is 100 percent, the air is saturated with water. No more water can evaporate.\nAir pressure also affects evaporation. If air pressure is high on the surface of a body of water, then the water will not evaporate easily. The pressure pushing down on the water makes it difficult for water to escape into the atmosphere as vapor. Storms are often high-pressure systems that prevent evaporation.\nTemperature, of course, affects how quickly evaporation happens. Boiling-hot water will evaporate quickly as steam.\nEvaporation is the opposite of condensation , the process of water vapor turning into liquid water.\nFast Fact\nRate of Evaporation\nThe National Weather Service in the United States measures the rate of evaporation at different locations every year. Scientists there found that the rate of evaporation can be below 76 centimeters (30 inches) per year at the low end, to 305 centimeters (120 inches) per year on the high end."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

Your body has several internal clocks, called circadian clocks . These typically follow a 24-hour repeating rhythm, called the circadian rhythm. This rhythm affects every cell, tissue, and organ in your body and how they work. Learn more in our Circadian Rhythms Disorders page .\nYour central circadian clock, located in your brain, tells you when it is time for sleep. Other circadian clocks are in organs throughout your body. Your body’s internal clocks are in sync with certain cues in the environment. Light, darkness, and other cues help determine when you feel awake and when you feel drowsy. Artificial light and caffeine can disrupt this process by giving your body false wakefulness cues.\nMost people’s natural circadian cycle is slightly greater than 24 hours. Some people naturally wake up early and some naturally stay up late. For example, it is natural for many teens to prefer later bedtimes and to sleep later in the morning than adults.\nThe rhythm and timing of the body clocks also decline with age. Neurons, or cells, in the brain that promote sleep are lost as part of normal aging. Certain conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease can also speed the loss of neurons. This makes it harder for older adults to stay asleep. Other factors, such as less physical activity or less time spent outdoors, also affect circadian rhythms. As a result, older adults usually sleep less and wake up earlier.\nFACT SHEET\nIn Brief: Your Guide to Healthy Sleep\nView the fact sheet , which tells you how to recognize if you or a loved one has a sleep disorder and has tips for getting better sleep.\nYour body has a biological need for sleep that increases when you have been awake for a long time. This is controlled by homeostasis, the process by which your body keeps your systems, such as your internal body temperature, steady.\nA compound called adenosine is linked to this need for sleep. While you are awake, the level of adenosine in your brain continues to rise. The rising levels signal a shift toward sleep. Caffeine and certain drugs can interrupt this process by blocking adenosine.\nIf you follow a natural schedule of days and nights, light signals received through your eyes tell your brain that it is daytime. The area of your brain that receives these signals, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, transmits the signals to the rest of your body through the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic system . This helps your central body clock stay in tune with the day and night. Exposure to artificial light interferes with this process.\nThe light–dark cycle influences when your brain makes and releases a hormone called melatonin. Melatonin travels to the cells in your body through your bloodstream. The amount of melatonin in your bloodstream starts to increase in the evening and peaks in the early morning. Melatonin is thought to promote sleep. As you are exposed to more light, such as the sun rising, your body releases another hormone called cortisol. Cortisol naturally prepares your body to wake up.\nExposure to bright artificial light in the late evening can disrupt this process and prevent your brain from releasing melatonin. This can make it harder to fall asleep. Examples of bright artificial light include the light from a TV screen, a smartphone, or a very bright alarm clock. Some people use physical filters or software to filter out some of the blue light from these devices.\nSome people have problems with their sleep/wake cycle, meaning that their brain does not keep them awake or asleep at appropriate times. They may have one of the following sleep disorders.\n- Insomnia : People who have insomnia have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. As a result, they may get too little sleep or not enough quality sleep. They may not feel refreshed when they wake up.\n- Narcolepsy : Narcolepsy causes periods of extreme daytime sleepiness. The disorder may also cause muscle weakness.\nBROCHURE\nPrint and use this sleep diary to record the quality and quantity of your sleep and daytime habits that may affect your sleep. You can then bring the diary with you to review the information with your doctor.\nSometimes, your central circadian clock is not properly aligned with your sleep time. This can happen if you have one of the following conditions.\n- Jet lag: Many people have trouble adjusting their sleep to fit a new time zone. This usually resolves within a few days.\n- Shift work disorder: People who work at night may have trouble sleeping during the day."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

He was best known as the creator of Thomas the Tank Engine and several other characters who appeared in his Railway Series .\nWilbert Awdry was born at Ampfield vicarage near Romsey , Hampshire , on 15 June 1911. His father was Vere Awdry (1854–1928), the Anglican vicar of Ampfield (who was 56 years old at the time of his birth), and his mother was Lucy Awdry (née Bury; 1884–1965). Wilbert was derived from William and Herbert, names of his father's two brothers. His younger brother, George, was born on 10 August 1916 and died on 27 October 1994. [1] [2] All three of Awdry's older half-siblings from his father's first two marriages died young, the youngest being killed in World War I . At Ampfield as a toddler he saw his father construct a handmade 40-yard (37 m), 2.5-inch-gauge (64 mm) model railway. [3] In 1917, the family moved to Box , in Wiltshire , moving again within Box in 1919 and in 1920, the third house being \"Journey's End\" (renamed from \"Lorne Villa\"), which remained the family home until August 1928. [4] [5]\n\"Journey's End\" was only 200 yards (180 m) from the western end of Box Tunnel , where the Great Western Railway main line climbs at a gradient of 1 in 100 for 2 miles (3.2 km). [6] A banking engine was kept there to assist freight trains up the hill. [6] These trains usually ran at night, and the young Awdry could hear them from his bed, listening to the coded whistle signals between the train engine and the banker as well as the sharp bark from the locomotive exhausts as they fought their way up the incline. [6] Awdry said, \"There was no doubt in my mind that steam engines all had definite personalities. I would hear them snorting up the grade and little imagination was needed to hear in the puffings and pantings of the two engines the conversation they were having with one another.\" [7] Here was the inspiration for the story of Edward helping Gordon 's train up the hill, a story that Wilbert first told his son Christopher some 25 years later, and which appeared in the first of the Railway Series books. [6]\nAwdry was educated at Marlborough House School, Hawkhurst, Kent (1919–1924), Dauntsey's School , West Lavington, Wiltshire (1924–1929), St Peter's Hall, Oxford (BA, 1932), and Wycliffe Hall, Oxford , where he gained his diploma in theology in 1933. He taught for three years from 1933 to 1936 at St George's School, Jerusalem . He was ordained to the Church of England diaconate in 1936 and subsequently the priesthood. In 1938, he married Margaret Emily Wale (1912 – 21 March 1989). In 1940, he took a curacy at St Nicolas Church, Kings Norton , Birmingham , where he lived until 1946. He subsequently moved to Cambridgeshire , serving as rector of Elsworth with Knapwell (1946–1950), rural dean at Bourn (1950–1953) and then vicar of Emneth , Norfolk (1953–1965). [8] He retired from full-time ministry in 1965 and moved to Rodborough in Stroud in Gloucestershire . [9]\nThe characters that would make Awdry known and the first stories featuring them were invented in 1942 to amuse his son Christopher during a bout of measles . After Awdry wrote The Three Railway Engines , he built Christopher a model of Edward , and some wagons and coaches, out of a wooden broomstick and scraps of wood. [10] Christopher also wanted a model of Gordon; however the wartime shortage of materials limited Awdry to making a little 0-6-0 tank engine . Awdry said, \"The natural name was Thomas – Thomas the Tank Engine.\" [10] Then Christopher requested stories about Thomas and these duly followed and were published in the book Thomas the Tank Engine , published in 1946.\nThe first book, The Three Railway Engines , was published in 1945. Awdry wrote 26 books in The Railway Series , the last in 1972. Christopher subsequently added further books to the series.\nIn 1947, 0-6-0T engine No. 1800 was built by Hudswell Clarke; it spent its working life at the Peterborough -based factory, a property of the British Sugar Corporation, pushing wagons of sugar beet until it was finally replaced by a diesel engine. Peterborough Railway Society purchased the engine in 1973, and this little blue 'Thomas' engine is the star of the Nene Valley Railway . [11]\nIn 1952, Awdry volunteered as a guard on the Talyllyn Railway in Wales , then in its second year of preservation. [12] The railway inspired Awdry to create the Skarloey Railway , based on the Talyllyn, with some of his exploits being written into the stories. [13]\nAwdry's enthusiasm for railways did not stop at his publications. He was involved in railway preservation, and built model railways , which he took to exhibitions around the country. At Emneth he created an extensive model railway network in his loft based on Barrow-in-Furness. [14] Emneth was also close to three Wisbech railway stations . Emneth railway station was on the EAR line from Magdalen Road Station (now known as Watlington) to Wisbech East, Emneth station is now a private residence. The GER Wisbech and Upwell Tramway tram engines, coaches and rolling stock were similar to Toby the Tram Engine and Henrietta and the Ely to King's Lynn mainline with Wisbech East railway station on Victoria Road. The M&GN Peterborough to Sutton Bridge via Wisbech North railway station on Harecroft Road. There were also harbour lines either side of the Port of Wisbech on the River Nene - M&GN Harbour West branch and GER Harbour East branch. He was a passenger on Alan Pegler 's 1968 non-stop Flying Scotsman London King's Cross to Edinburgh run.\nAwdry wrote other books besides those of The Railway Series , both fiction and non-fiction. The story Belinda the Beetle was about a red car (it became a Volkswagen Beetle only in the illustrations to the paperback editions).\nIn 1988, his second Ffarquhar model railway layout was shown to the public for the final time and was featured on an ITN News news item. He was again featured on TV-am for Thomas's 40th anniversary in 1990. During all this, Awdry faced many battles – health problems, depression, and the death of his wife, brother and close friend Teddy Boston . Five years later, he was interviewed by Nicholas Jones for the Bookmark film The Thomas the Tank Engine Man , which first aired on 25 February 1995 and repeated again on 15 April 1997 shortly after his death.\nAwdry was awarded an OBE in the 1996 New Year's Honours List, but by that time his health had deteriorated and he was unable to travel to London. He died peacefully in his sleep in Stroud , Gloucestershire, on 21 March 1997, at the age of 85. [15] His ashes are interred at Gloucester Crematorium.\nA biography entitled The Thomas the Tank Engine Man was written by Brian Sibley and published in 1995.\nA Class 91 locomotive, 91 124, used to bear the name The Rev W Awdry . A Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST (saddle tank) engine on the Dean Forest Railway is named Wilbert after him; and was used as the title character in Christopher Awdry's Railway Series book Wilbert the Forest Engine .\nIn 2003, a stained glass window commissioned by the Awdry family was unveiled at St. Edmund's church, Emneth, Norfolk. [16]\nIn 2011, a blue plaque was unveiled by his daughter Veronica Chambers at The Old Vicarage, Emneth where he lived between 1953 and 1965. In 2012 a blue plaque was unveiled at \"Lorne House\", Box, where he lived between 1920 and 1928 when its name was \"Journey's End\". [17]\nIn 2013, Cambridgeshire County Council named their new offices in Wisbech Awdry House in his memory. [18]\nIn 2015, he was rendered in CGI for a special cameo in Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure , then later in 2016, he was rendered in CGI again as a cameo in The Great Race . He made frequent appearances ever since, occasionally interacting with the engines, and is referred to by his Railway Series alias, 'The Thin Clergyman'.\nA pedestrian rail crossing bridge has been dedicated to Awdry in 2017 in the small Hampshire town of Chandlers Ford , which is very close (and has the closest railway line and station) to his birthplace of Ampfield.\nIn 2021, to mark the 75th anniversary of Thomas the Tank Engine, a blue plaque was unveiled at the old Rectory of Holy Trinity Church in Ellsworth, Cambridgeshire. Cambridge Past, Present & Future put up the plaque to mark the books he wrote there. His daughter, Veronica Chambers, said she was \"delighted and moved\". [19]\nIn the second book in the series, Thomas the Tank Engine , Awdry wrote this \"letter\" to his son Christopher: [20] [21]\nDear Christopher,\nHere is your friend Thomas, the Tank Engine.\nHe wanted to come out of his station-yard and see the world.\nThese stories tell you how he did it.\nI hope you will like them because you helped me to make them.\nYour Loving Daddy\nSubsequent books featured a similar letter from the author, addressed to the readers of the book as \"Dear Friends\", which introduced the background to the stories within the book.\nThis text also appears at the beginning of Thomas and Friends episodes from 2004 to 2012. The \"letter\" appears with a storybook showing Thomas on the front cover with \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" at the top and \"By the Rev. W. Awdry\" at the bottom. The book then opens up and we see the letter, read by British actor Nigel Plaskitt , and after the letter is finished a \"steam\" transition appears and it transitions to the Thomas & Friends theme song.\nFiction"], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

This is usually accomplished with flashing, gutters and eavestroughs. So, what is an eavestrough, and how is it different than a gutter? Read on for some clarification.\nThe easiest way to understand an eavestrough is to understand eaves. Eaves are a section of the roof that extends past the wall. This creates a separate “drip line,” which directs water away from the walls. An eavestrough, therefore, is a small trough that collects rainwater at the base of the eaves.\nIf that description sounded an awful lot like rain gutters, you’re not far off. They are more or less the same thing—gutters are simply a catch-all term for anything performing a similar function. That’s why you have gutters near sidewalks and in bowling alleys. They collect water (or bowling balls) and move it elsewhere.\nIn short, “eavestroughs” is just a word for a very specific type of gutter: the ones on your building’s eaves. The reason people get confused is because many contractors and laypeople use the terms interchangeably, without ever explaining that they’re virtually the same thing.\nRainwater and melting snow can cause a lot of damage if they’re left to penetrate your roof, walls or foundation. Rain gutters are designed to collect any water on your roof, then safely divert it a distance away from your walls and foundation. The water soaks into your yard and eventually becomes part of the groundwater system.\nIf you didn’t have gutters—or if the gutters become clogged—the water will collect on the roof, then run down the walls and into the foundation. Your roof may experience leaks. The water might also soak into the walls, which can stain the interior, compromise the wall’s structural integrity and cause mold and mildew to develop. Finally, when too much water pools around a building’s foundation, the foundation can crack and shift. When your foundation fails, it can cost tens of thousands of dollars to repair.\nUltimately, it’s better to install gutters or eavestroughs and clean them out regularly. You’ll save more money by preventing the damage than you would if you simply let the water penetrate the building.\nRain gutters are fairly simple to care for. There are two things you need to look for: dirt and debris, which can clog your gutters, and sagging. Every month, make sure no plant debris has made its way into the gutters. If it has, scoop it out and dispose of it. (Alternatively, install gutters with a leaf shield.) You should also check after any major wind or rainstorms, as those will send more plant debris flying through the air.\nFinally, watch your gutters carefully. If they appear to be sagging or cracked, the water will leak out and cause damage. Have a contractor repair them right away.\nWhen you need gutters , or for more information about how gutters and eavestroughs differ from each other, call Rhino Exteriors today."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Qatar, Cambodia, and Niger have the lowest unemployment rates in the world according to Investopedia.", "reference_documents": ["Global economies recover unevenly from the COVID-19 pandemic\nUpdated July 22, 2022\nReviewed by\nFact checked by\nThe highest and lowest unemployment rates in the world vary dramatically, even among the Earth's largest economies.\nUnemployment in the United States, the largest economy in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) , was at 3.5% by the end of February 2020—the lowest rate in half a century—but quickly rose to 14.7% by April in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact. By way of comparison, our historical research shows that the average U.S. annual unemployment rate from 1949 through 2019 was 5.8%.\n1\n2\nThe Congressional Budget Office originally expected the unemployment rate to peak at over 14% in the third quarter of 2020 and to quickly improve after that.\n3\nAlthough it was right about the peak, the U.S. economy recovered much faster than predicted, with the unemployment rate having continued to decrease each month since the start of the pandemic—barring 0.1% increases from May to June 2021 and December 2021 to January 2022. As of June 2022, the unemployment rate sits at 3.6%.\n2\nHowever, the economic recovery hasn't been felt equally by all countries, with several nations having unemployment rates just as bad, if not worse than they were before the pandemic began.\n4\nBelow are the countries with the highest and lowest unemployment rates, in addition to the unemployment rates of the world's largest economies by GDP, according to the most recently available data from the World Bank.\n- Unemployment typically measures individuals in the labor force, those that are not working but are actively seeking work.\n- The countries that have the lowest unemployment rates are Qatar, Cambodia, and Niger.\n- Just because a country has a low unemployment rate, does not mean its citizens are necessarily well-off. That is determined by GDP per capita.\n- The countries with the highest unemployment rates include South Africa, Djibouti, and Eswatini. 5\nThe world's top five highest unemployment rates at the end of 2021 were in Africa and occupied Palestine.\n5\n- Botswana: 24.7% 5\nSouth Africa had one of the highest unemployment rates in the world in 2021.\n5\nIt's also the second-richest country in this grouping. The World Bank estimated its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita to be $6,994.2 in 2021.\n6\nDjibouti benefits from its location on the Red Sea, making it a bridge between Africa and the Middle East. Djibouti was less affected by the pandemic than other countries due to \"buoyant free zone re-exports and exports of transportation, logistics, and telecommunication services to and from Ethiopia in 2020 Q3 and Q4.\" Its outlook is positive but that is dependent on how Ethiopia fairs.\n7\nThe Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza are currently facing an unsustainable economic situation. The Palestinian economy has continued to feel the impact of both the economic fallout of the COVID-19 outbreak and a political standoff that made it difficult for the Palestinian Authority to collect tax revenue in 2020. In addition, in 2021, Gaza saw further armed conflict with Israel, damaging economic prospects.\n8\nEswatini suffers from extreme poverty and the world's highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, according to the CIA. HIV/AIDS tends to cause a substantial decline in productivity as households lose manpower to the disease.\n9\nIn 2021, Botswana witnessed an economic rebound of 12.1% with strong growth expected at 4.1% after the impact of the pandemic fades.\n10\nPart-time workers are counted as employed, and these figures don't count people who give up looking for work for an extended period of time.\nBelow are the world's 10 lowest unemployment rates at the end of 2021:\n- Bahrain: 1.9% 5\nThe above countries have stunning unemployment rates and all bested the U.S. by a considerable margin at the end of 2021.\n5\nThe unemployment rates for the top 10 largest economies by GDP were predictably low at the end of 2021, with some outliers like France and Italy.\n11\n5\n- Korea, Republic: 3.5% 11 5\nAs the world has begun to open up after the pandemic, these figures should improve over time; however, much of the world is still negatively impacted by the pandemic, its impact on the global supply chain, and the war in Ukraine that began in February 2022.\nThe number of people in the U.S. who lost their jobs within a two-week period at the end of March in 2020, according to the Department of Labor.\n12\nHaving a low unemployment rate does not mean a country's economy is particularly strong. For instance, Niger had only 0.8% unemployment in 2021, but its GDP per capita was $594.9 in 2021, according to the World Bank. Burundi had 1.8% unemployment in 2021 but a GDP per capita of $236.8 in 2021.\n5\n6\nThese countries have low unemployment figures in large part because their economies rely heavily on agriculture, which is labor-intensive but seasonal. Remember that the underemployed are still counted in employment figures. Even Laos, with a relatively healthy GDP per capita of $2,551.3 in 2021, still employed 61% of its workforce in agriculture in 2019.\n13\n6\nOf course, it's possible to have both low unemployment and a rich economy. This combination is seen in Qatar. According to the World Bank, GDP per capita in Qatar was $61,276 in 2021. That wealth helps its standing in the above listing, as a country's unemployment rate only factors in those actively looking for work. The working-age child of rich parents may feel less pressure to earn money and be more inclined to spend it.\n6\nQatar's economy is driven by oil and natural gas, hence its extreme wealth, though it's been making a sustained push to diversify into financial services, construction, restaurants, and hotels.\n14\nThe International Labor Organization forecasts the global unemployment rate for 2022 to be 5.9%. This is lower than the 6.6% and 6.2% rates witnessed in 2020 and 2021, respectively, but remains above 2019's rate of 5.4%. Unemployment rates are closest to their pre-pandemic levels in high-income countries like the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, where unemployment is at or near historic lows.\n15\nThe unemployment rate only takes into consideration the labor force. The labor force consists of those individuals that are currently working and those that are not working but who are looking for work. If an individual has not been looking for work in the previous four weeks, they are not considered part of the labor force and do not factor into the unemployment rate.\n16\nThe unemployment rate in the U.S. as of June 2022 is 3.6%. This remains unchanged from the previous month.\n17\nThe majority of the world's economies suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many countries seeing their unemployment levels increase.\n4\nAs the world emerges from the pandemic, conditions have improved; however, the world faces a new set of challenges, such as high inflation, global supply chain problems, and a war in Europe that is impacting food supplies around the world.\nSponsored\nEarn a Competitive Savings Rate\nWant to make the most of your savings?

The term is easier to understand by breaking it down into separate words.\nAn Eave is a section of roof that extends over a wall to create a clear drip line that protects the wall from rainwater damaging the wall. An eavestrough is mounted to the outer edge of the eave to collect rain water. Hence the name, eavestrough.\nThe term gutter is more generic and is essentially any repository for runoff. In current times, gutter is more of a common term for the eavestrough. It is probably more common because it’s shorter and easier to say. In reality, eavestroughs and gutters are virtually the same thing.\nGutter has more meaning to it and can even be referred to as the gutter along the street. It can be referred to as just an area where something is stored and that a resource flows into.\nEavestroughs are specifically built at the edge of a roof for collecting and re-directing rain water.\nThere are certain regions of countries, areas that are strictly referring to residential and commercial buildings. When they refer to those buildings, the gutters they use the term eavestrough is very regional. So from one region to another yield here, either gutter or eavestrough as the identifying term for that section that catches rain water on an eaves of a home or a business.\nThe main reason is that people are unfamiliar and just don’t understand the fundamental definition of the two terms. When one person refers to an eavestrough, and the other refers to a gutter, there could be a difference. If you go to different regions and you’re not using the correct phrase you could be misunderstood. That confusion is because an eavestrough is very specific to the side of a structure at the edge of a roof. One is mounted to the eaves of a home and the other has multiple meanings referring to a repository.\nEavestroughs and gutters are universal terms. When using them, just like if you were in the sales of one or the other, you would want to be sure to know what the most common term is in that region. I’ve done sales in several different regions in the United States and the northern United States tends to use the term eavestrough. In the southern United States tends to use the term gutter. Of course, you can be in the southern states and meet a northerner and vice versa.

The mixed doubles tournament varies slightly.\nMen's and women's tournaments include 10 teams; mixed doubles has eight teams in the field. In the preliminary round, each team plays every other team. After each team has completed nine games (men's and women's) or seven games (mixed doubles), the teams with the four best records advance to the semifinals. If there are not a clear top four teams, tie-breaking procedures will be used to determine the playoff teams (see below).\nOnce the semifinals begin, if a team had a better record than its opponent, it has the choice of shooting first or second in the first end. If the teams have the same record, the winner of their round robin game has the choice of shooting first or second in the first end. In the semifinals, the top-ranked team from the round-robin will play the fourth-place team, and the second-place team will play the third-place team (1v4, 2v3).\nThe winners of the semifinals meet in the final for the gold medal. The losers play for the bronze medal.\nEach game in men's and women's curling is 10 ends in length. Mixed doubles play eight ends. Each end is complete when the two teams have each delivered all stones alternately and determined the score. If the teams are tied at the completion of 10 ends (men's and women's) or eight ends (mixed doubles), a complete extra end must be played to break the tie. If the teams are still tied, play must continue for as many ends as may be required to break the tie.\nDuring the round robin, men's and women's teams may concede the game once a minimum of six ends have been completed. During the playoffs, a minimum of eight ends must be completed. Conceding the game when the losing skip feels he is too far down to come back is fairly common and is an accepted part of the etiquette of the sport. It should happen multiple times during the course of the Olympics.\nEach team in the men's and women's tournaments will receive 38 minutes of thinking time for 10 ends. There are one-minute breaks between ends 1-5 and 6-10. Between the fifth and sixth end, there is a five-minute break. Each team can call one 60-second timeout per game to consult with its coach. Mixed doubles teams receive 22 minutes of thinking. There is a five minute break after the completion of the fourth end.\nIf a games in the men's and women's tournaments require an extra end or ends, each team receives four minutes and 30 seconds of thinking time for each extra end. There will be one-minute breaks between the 10th and 11th end and any subsequent ends. Each team can call one 60-second timeout in each extra end. An extra end in the mixed doubles tournament is allotted three minutes.\nTie-breaking procedure\nAfter teams are ranked according to their win-loss records following the round robin portion, the system listed below is used to rank the teams that are tied. The same system is used to rank teams for seeding in the semifinals. The following criteria (in order) will be used to rank the teams at the completion of the round robin:\n1. If two teams are tied, the team that won their round robin game will be ranked higher (head-to-head).\n2. If three or more teams are tied, the record of the games between the tied teams will provide the ranking. Should this provide a ranking for some teams but not all, then the record of the games between the remaining teams that are still tied will determine the ranking (head-to-head).\n3. If the ties are still not broken, the rankings will be determined using the Draw Shot Challenge (DSC). The DSC is the average distance from the button a stone travels with each teams’ Last Stone Draws (LSD), which were played by a team during the round robin. The worst mark is automatically eliminated before calculating the average distance. The team with the lower DSC receives the higher ranking. If the DSCs are equal, then the team with the best non-equal LSD receives the higher ranking. In case all LSDs are equal, the team ranked higher in the WCF World Rankings is ranked higher."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

The film stars Mark Rylance , Ruby Barnhill in her film debut, Penelope Wilton , Jemaine Clement , Rebecca Hall , Rafe Spall and Bill Hader . In the film, a 10-year-old orphaned girl named Sophie befriends a benevolent giant dubbed the \"Big Friendly Giant\", who takes her to Giant Country, where they attempt to stop the man-eating giants that are invading the human world.\nKathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall began development on a live-action adaptation of The BFG back in the 1990s, and various screenwriters were hired to work on the screenplay in the subsequent years. DreamWorks acquired the screen rights to Dahl's book in September 2011, and Marshall and Sam Mercer joined as producers, Mathison as screenwriter and Kennedy as executive producer. Spielberg was announced as director in April 2014, alongside his production company Amblin Entertainment as co-producer. Principal photography commenced in March 2015, marking Spielberg's first directorial film for Walt Disney Pictures , which co-financed the film. [10]\nThe BFG premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2016, and held its North American debut at the El Capitan Theater on June 21, 2016. [11] The film was released in the United States in Disney Digital 3D , RealD 3D , IMAX 3D , [12] and conventional theatrical formats on July 1, 2016, the same year of Dahl's centennial . It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its visuals, direction, performances and entertainment value. However, the film was a box office bomb , grossing $195 million against its $140 million budget. [13] [14] [15] [16]\nSophie, a 10-year-old girl living in a London orphanage, is often awake at the \" witching hour \". One night, she shouts at some men in an alleyway. Later, she sees an elderly Giant Man outside her window, who captures her and takes her to his home in Giant Country. He explains that he cannot allow Sophie to return to her world and reveal the existence of giants. If she ventures out alone, she may be eaten by the nine much larger giants.\nIn his workshop of dreams, the giant fashions a nightmare to convince the sleeping Sophie to stay with him in safety. The Fleshlumpeater, the infantile leader of the man-eating giants, intrudes and demands a \" boo-boo \" on his finger to be fixed. He smells Sophie, but the elderly giant convinces him to leave. Sophie persuades the friendly giant to take her to visit Dream Country. They accidentally awaken the other giants, and after the Bloodbottler suggests they \"frolic\", they bully the friendly giant. A thunderstorm drives the man-eating giants into their cave, but the Fleshlumpeater finds Sophie's dropped blanket.\nIn Dream Country, Sophie and the friendly giant catch good and bad dreams. The giant reveals that his only name – besides \"Runt\", the other giants' nickname for him – is \"the Big Friendly Giant\", which leads Sophie to call him \"BFG\". She accompanies him to London for his nightly work: using his dream trumpet to spread good dreams to sleeping children. They return to Giant Country just as the other giants have finished eating children worldwide. The BFG realizes that Sophie has lost her blanket, exposing her presence to the other giants, and leaves her outside her orphanage. Explaining that his last human companion liked to read, and even taught The BFG how to read, but sadly The Boy was discovered and eaten by the giants, he is unwilling to endanger Sophie and departs. Unafraid, Sophie jumps off her balcony in the hope he will appear again to catch her, and he does.\nThey return to the BFG's workshop and the other giants barge in, hunting for Sophie. They destroy much of the BFG's work, but Sophie evades detection and the BFG drives them off with a hot iron. Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG, with a portrait of Queen Victoria among his belongings. This inspires her to devise a plan: to forge a nightmare for Elizabeth II , the Queen of the United Kingdom , about giants eating the children of England, the British Army fighting the giants, and Sophie appearing to her.\nSophie and the BFG go to Buckingham Palace and deliver the nightmare to the sleeping Queen. Upon waking, the Queen and members of her staff Mary and Mr Tibbs find Sophie on the windowsill. She introduces them to the BFG, explaining that the child-eating giants are real and must be stopped. At a large breakfast, the BFG shares his favourite drink, flatulence -inducing \"frobscottle\", and he and Sophie lead the Queen's soldiers to Giant Country.\nThe BFG plans to ambush the man-eating giants with a nightmare but has forgotten his dream trumpet. Sophie carries the nightmare herself into the midst of the giants and is confronted by the Fleshlumpeater. She releases the nightmare which consumes the giants with guilt, except the unregretful Fleshlumpeater (who intercepts and destroys his), and they are trapped by military helicopters. Carried away to an isolated island, the giants are left with only \"snozzcumbers\", a disgusting vegetable, to plant and eat, much to their despair.\nSophie gets adopted by Mary, comes to live in the Queen's palace, and awakens from a dream of the BFG, who returns to his life at Giant Country and writes the story of their adventure. She speaks to him whenever she feels lonely; at his home, the BFG hears her words and smiles.\n- Mark Rylance as the Big Friendly Giant (BFG), an elderly, benevolent 24-foot giant . He is called \"Runt\" by the other giants. [17]\n- Ruby Barnhill as Sophie, an orphan who befriends The BFG. [18] Dahl named her after his own mother, who was similarly caring and determined.\n- Jemaine Clement as The Fleshlumpeater, an aquaphobic 54-foot giant who is the de facto leader of the man-eating giants. He shows no regret for consuming children over the years. [19]\n- Rebecca Hall as Mary, Queen Elizabeth's maid and Sophie's mother. [19]\n- Rafe Spall as Mr. Tibbs, Queen Elizabeth's butler. [20]\n- Bill Hader as the Bloodbottler, a disheveled 43-foot man-eating giant with cowlick hair who is Fleshlumpeater's advisor and the most intelligent of the group. [21]\n- Michael Adamthwaite as the Butcher Boy, an overweight, immature man-eating giant who is the youngest of the group. He collects cars and wears clothes made of circus tents. [19]\n- Daniel Bacon as the Bonecruncher, a dark-skinned, bald-headed man-eating giant. As the name suggests, he loves to crunch on the bones of his victims like candy. It's said he can be heard crunching bones for miles. [19]\n- Chris Gibbs as the Gizzardgulper, a burly, bearded 39-foot man-eating giant who wears a helmet and is the shortest of the group. [19]\n- Adam Godley as the Manhugger, a very tall and slim man-eating giant who wears a vest and shorts. He seems to be the laziest of them all. [19]\n- Paul Moniz de Sa as the Meatdripper, a well-groomed man-eating giant with Mohawk hair. He also is the most serious about hunting in the group, clearly more determined than the rest to find Sophie. he doesn't wear a shirt, and has red shorts. [19]\n- Jonathan Holmes as the Childchewer, a balding man-eating giant who is Meatdripper's best friend. He obviously enjoys human child the most out of the giants, and eats only children. [19]\n- Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as the Maidmasher, a small-headed man-eating giant. He has short thin hair, and as the name suggests, likes to smash maidens. Either with his teeth, hands or feet. It is never expanded on. [19]\n- Marilyn Norry as Mrs. Clonkers, the head of the orphanage where Sophie was living.\n- Chris Shields, Matt Frewer , and Geoffrey Wade as The Queen's Generals\nAdamthwaite, Bacon, Gibbs, Godley, Holmes, Moniz de Sa, and Ólafsson also make cameos as minor London characters. William Samples and Ruby Barnhill's father, Paul Barnhill, make cameos as the palace staff members.\nProducers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy began development on a live-action adaptation of The BFG in 1991, and set the project up at Paramount Pictures . [22] Husband and wife screenwriters Robin Swicord and Nicholas Kazan wrote a screenplay adaptation in 1998, with Robin Williams in negotiations for the title role. [23] [24] [25] Williams attended a read-through , which according to Michael Siegel was \"surprisingly disappointing\". [26] Williams' trademark improvisational style clashed with the BFG's unique language. [26] Siegel elaborates, \"He was sort of improvising on the jumbled language. And it was clunky. It was strangely not working. It was harder than it looks even for Robin. It didn't quite deliver.\" [26] By 2001, the script had been rewritten by Gwyn Lurie, and was greeted with positive feedback from the Dahl estate. [27] Terry Jones and Ed Solomon also attempted screenplay drafts. [26] While the screenplay lingered in development hell , Paramount subsequently lost the film rights and they reverted to the Dahl estate. [26]\nIn September 2011, DreamWorks [28] acquired the film rights to the book; Kennedy and Marshall were announced to produce, with screenwriter Melissa Mathison adapting the story. [28] Initially, John Madden was hired to direct; however, in April 2014, Steven Spielberg [29] was announced as the director, with Madden now listed as executive producer with producer Michael Siegel. [30] Kennedy had initially thought of Spielberg as director, but hesitated asking him until a more concrete screenplay was presentable. [31] Spielberg stated, \" The BFG has enchanted families and their children for more than three decades. We are honoured that the Roald Dahl estate has entrusted us with this classic story.\" [32] Walden Media [3] agreed to co-produce and co-finance the film with DreamWorks and Amblin Entertainment in March 2015. [3] A month later, Walt Disney Studios [19] —which was under prior agreement to distribute the film through its Touchstone Pictures banner—also joined the production as a co-producer and co-financier, and shifted the film from a Touchstone release to a Walt Disney Pictures production instead. [29] Consequently, The BFG is the first Disney-branded film directed by Spielberg, though he has previously produced several films for the studio. [33] Similarly, as a result of Amblin Partners ' [10] restructuring, DreamWorks did not receive a marquee credit —placement of the studio's production logo on marketing materials and opening titles—and instead, DreamWorks' marquee credit shifted to Amblin. [34] [35] The film is the second adaptation of the novel following the 1989 direct-to-television animated film . It is also Disney's first feature-length adaptation of a Roald Dahl work since 1996, Henry Selick's James and the Giant Peach .\nMark Rylance was cast as the BFG in October 2014. [17] Spielberg had approached Rylance with the role during the filming of Bridge of Spies . [36] [37] Spielberg was quoted as saying that \"Mark Rylance is a transformational actor. I am excited and thrilled that Mark will be making this journey with us to Giant Country. Everything about his career so far is about making the courageous choice and I'm honoured he has chosen The BFG as his next big screen performance.\" [38] [39] Rylance performed the character through motion capture , a process which he referred to as \"liberating\". [40] In mid-November 2014, it was revealed that a ten-year-old student of Lower Peover School, Ruby Barnhill , had auditioned for the film. She had to learn six pages of dialogue in preparation for a possible role as the orphan Sophie. [41] After a lengthy search, on December 16, Barnhill was cast in the role, about which she said, \"I feel incredibly lucky and I'm so happy.\" Spielberg stated that they \"have discovered a wonderful Sophie in Ruby Barnhill.\" [18] Bill Hader was set to star in the film in an unspecified role on March 27, 2015. [21] On April 13, 2015, the rest of the cast was announced, which included Penelope Wilton , Rebecca Hall , Jemaine Clement , Michael David Adamthwaite , Daniel Bacon, Chris Gibbs, Adam Godley , Jonathan Holmes, Paul Moniz de Sa, and Ólafur Ólafsson . [19]\nPrincipal photography on the film began on March 23, 2015, in Vancouver [19] [42] and concluded on June 12, 2015. [43] Weta Digital worked on the film's visual effects. [44] It is Mathison's final film following her death on November 4, 2015.\nJohn Williams composed and conducted the film's musical score, marking the twenty-seventh collaboration between Spielberg and Williams. [45] Williams was announced as the film's composer in March 2015. [46] During the process of writing the score, Williams compared the film to \"a child's ballet where there are dances involved,\" elaborating, \"The BFG tries to capture dreams with his net and does something that almost looks like a Ray Bolger or Fred Astaire dance; it is an amazingly musical and choreographic sequence which required the orchestra to do things that are more associated with musical films.\" [47] Williams found similarities with the scoring of Home Alone , admitting that writing music for The BFG \"was really an opportunity to compose and orchestrate a little children's fantasy for orchestra.\" [48] The soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on July 1, 2016. [49]\nThe BFG premiered on May 14, 2016, at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival , in an out of competition screening. [50] Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributed the film worldwide, except for territories in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, where the film's distribution rights were sold by Amblin's international partner, Mister Smith Entertainment , to independent distributors. [3] [29] [51]\nDisney released a teaser trailer on December 9, 2015. [52] A second trailer was released on April 5, 2016. [53] A third trailer was released on May 16, 2016. [54] The film held its North American premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California on June 21, 2016. [11] It was released in the United States on July 1, 2016. [55] Entertainment One distributed the film in the U.K. on July 22, 2016. [56] DreamWorks' financial partner, Reliance Entertainment , released the film in India on July 29, 2016. [57] Huaxia Film Distribution released the film in China.\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released The BFG on Blu-ray , DVD , and digital download on November 29, 2016. The film debuted in third of the home media sales chart for the week ending on December 2, 2016. [58] Entertainment One and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the UK edition on DVD in 2016.\nThe BFG grossed $55.5 million in North America and $139.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $195.2 million, against a production budget of $140 million. [9]\nIn the United States and Canada, The BFG opened alongside The Legend of Tarzan and The Purge: Election Year at 3,357 theaters, and was projected to gross $22–32 million in its opening weekend. [59] [60] The film was notably vying for drawing family audiences with the studio's own Finding Dory . [8] It made $775,000 from its Thursday previews; however, the low figure was not surprising, given how family films tend to attract fewer audiences during late-night showings. [61] [62] [63] This was followed by a $7 million opening day (including previews) and a disappointing $18.6 million opening weekend, which Deadline Hollywood called \"an awful start for this film which is estimated to cost $140 million\". [64] [65] Forbes noted that Steven Spielberg's films tend to have long runs, irrespective of their opening numbers. However, it also pointed out that the July 4th weekend proves to be a non-leggy release schedule and most films released during this time end up making only twice their holiday total over the course of their domestic theatrical run. [66] The New York Times called the opening figures \"a colossal misfire\". [67]\nDue to the film's poor performance in North America, the film was considered a box office disappointment . [13] [14] [15] [16] As a result of its low opening numbers in North America, the film needed greater financial success in its international markets, as pointed out by David Hollis, Disney's distribution chief, saying, \"we're going to be reliant in a lot of ways on international [audiences]\". [67] Internationally—during its opening weekend—where the 4th of July weekend is not a holiday, the film opened to $3.9 million in its opening weekend from two markets, Australia and Russia. [68] In Australia, it opened to $2 million placing third while in Russia it debuted second with $1.9 million, which tops the entire runs of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and War Horse . In the United Kingdom, where the book is more well known, it opened to $6.9 million. [69]\nIn China, the release was handled by Huaxia Film Distribution . While it benefitted from a robust marketing effort including Spielberg's presence in the country itself, it suffered from a three month long delay after its North American release. It had an estimated $13.8 million opening, debuting at second place behind Operation Mekong . [70] [71] Many Chinese online reviews criticized Spielberg for making the film \"too juvenile\" for adults. [72]\nThe BFG is one of the lowest-grossing films of Spielberg's career, specifically in North America and, when accounting for inflation, one of the year's biggest flops, but The Hollywood Reporter noted that Disney would be able to withstand the losses due to the success of Captain America: Civil War and Finding Dory . [73] The site also highlighted that the financial losses for Disney could be $90–100 million based on theatrical returns alone. [74]\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 301 reviews and an average rating of 6.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \" The BFG minimizes the darker elements of Roald Dahl's classic in favor of a resolutely good-natured, visually stunning, and largely successful family-friendly adventure.\" [75] On another aggregator, Metacritic , the film has a score of 66 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". [76] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale. [77]\nJustin Chang of Los Angeles Times called Rylance's performance a \"brilliant amalgam of performance-capture technology and peerless screen presence.\" [78] Scott Mendelson of Forbes described the film as \"a charming, intelligent, and witty little adventure movie with strong special effects work in the service of a most unassuming story.\" [79] Mendelson also commended the film's smaller scope in story, as well as Rylance and Barnhill's interaction. [79] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph called the film \"a significant technical accomplishment\", adding that \"the infinitesimally detailed motion-capture technology alone, which stretches Rylance’s human performance to gargantuan proportions, is river-straddling bounds beyond anything that’s come before it.\" [80] Critic Matt Zoller Seitz highly appreciated Spielberg's direction of the film, giving the film three and a half out of four stars. Seitz remarks, \"I can imagine some adults finding the movie dull; 'Nothing happens', they'll say. 'And it's too nice.' But I can imagine other adults loving the film for helping them remember what it's like to be young enough to hide from a movie monster because he's big and weird-looking and then laugh because he's kind of silly...\" [81]\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter compared the film objectively to Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial , as a \"conspicuously less captivating, magical and transporting experience than its classic forebear.\" [82] Peter Debruge of Variety , however, compared the film favorably to E.T. , writing, \"this splendid Steven Spielberg-directed adaptation makes it possible for audiences of all ages to wrap their heads around one of the unlikeliest friendships in cinema history, resulting in the sort of instant family classic “human beans” once relied upon Disney to deliver.\" [83] A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film's digital effects and visual style as \"exquisite\", though he felt that the film lacked the excitement found in Spielberg's previous fantasy films. [84]\nRichard Brody of The New Yorker stating that it \"plays like a forced march of fun, a mandatory strain of magic and a prescribed dose of poetry, like a movie ready-made for screening in classrooms when a teacher is absent.\" Brody, however, observes that \"Spielberg is the BFG who's menaced by bigger and more monstrous giants who aren't interested in edifying their audiences but merely in consuming them—consuming the consumer, so to speak.\" [85] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \"technically impressive but listless and tedious... painfully cutesy, silly and gross rather than whimsical and funny.\" He thought that the film moved far too slowly and was missing a \"sense of wonder and adventure\", saying that he'd \"rather see every one of Spielberg's previous films before having to sit through The BFG again\".

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "OpenAI is a non-profit organization while Siri and Alexa are owned by two corporate giants (Apple and Amazon).", "reference_documents": ["When OpenAI made ChatGPT available last month for testing purposes, there wasn’t too much hype around it because, for people, it was just an improved version of Instruct GPT, another NLP model developed by OpenAI that wasn’t too successful.\nHowever, things have changed a lot since then, as people in the AI industry have been blown away by its ability to converse like a real human being and answer many questions that can only be answered by a human. It has quickly garnered more than a million users within its testing phase, which is a big-bang success story by any standards.\nIn such a situation, it’s natural that people are comparing it with mainstream AI-based voice assistants like Alexa or Siri and wondering if it’s better than them. We’re going to answer this question for you in this article. We’ll explore everything – how ChatGPT is different from voice assistants, how it is better, and where it falls short. Let’s start!\nChatGPT is a fantastic AI assistant for answering long queries and doing other tasks that can’t be done by Alexa or Siri. Its use cases are different from Alexa or Siri, and it excels in all of them far more than any other AI-based voice assistant.\nBefore we can see how and why ChatGPT is better than voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, it’s important to take a look at some of the key differences between both. Here they’re:\n- Siri and Alexa can interact with the physical world and complete actions on other apps/devices, while ChatGPT can’t do any of that (at least for now). That’s because it has been designed to provide more detailed and comprehensive answers to a wide spectrum of questions.\n- Siri and Alexa have more applications in our day-to-day lives, while ChatGPT is meant more for business-related use cases (again, for now, at least).\nThese two differences make ChatGPT a quite different kind of AI assistant than Alexa or Siri, and also defines what ChatGPT does better and where it lags behind these voice assistants. It can definitely not play songs for you, turn off the lights in your room or call your janitor when you’re in the office, but it can certainly help you complete the work you do in your office much faster than Alexa or Siri.\nIn the sections given below, we shall explore this core competency in greater detail.\nThe first thing that makes ChatGPT better than Alexa or Siri is its ownership. While Alexa and Siri are owned by two of the biggest corporate giants (Amazon and Apple), ChatGPT is the brainchild of OpenAI, which is a non-profit organization. Being a non-profit, they’re not under constant pressure to maximize their revenue and earnings, so they’re far less likely to trade your data with advertisers for revenue generation.\nThis means greater data privacy than Alexa and Siri and more control over the storage of your data. In fact, ChatGPT conversations can be easily deleted with the click of a “Clear Conversation” button after you have got the help you needed. There is no chat history, and therefore your data is used only for as long as you wish. These things give ChatGPT a clear edge over Siri and Alexa when it comes to data ownership and privacy.\nAny AI assistant is only as good as it’s accurate. And when we’re dealing with an assistant that has been designed for office work, it becomes even more important!\nThe good news here is that ChatGPT is quite accurate with whatever it can do for now. Not only it can generate human-like responses without any sort of grammatical errors, but also it can tweak its responses if you tweak your questions to provide you with more precise answers than Alexa or Siri, as you can see below.\nIts accuracy is maintained even when you ask a follow-up question linked to a question that you already asked – an area where Siri and Alexa still fall short sometimes. You don’t need to make your questions unnecessarily longer to squeeze all the info in one question, and you also don’t need to keep repeating the topic, subject, or object of the question to get an accurate answer. ChatGPT understands the context of conversation and answers accordingly, just as a human would!\nThis sort of accuracy and fluency is the result of training the ChatGPT model on a larger database. It has been trained on a much larger database of words than Alexa or Siri, which has made it far more conversational and accurate.\nAs we said above, conversations with ChatGPT sound exactly like conversations with a human being. Not only the answers are thorough and error-free but also they are in quite a fluent language. While Alexa and Siri are also quite fluent in their answers, they can’t give as long responses as ChatGPT with an equal level of fluency.\nThis difference is, and it’s likely to remain because ChatGPT has been designed from the outset to handle long conversations with ease. That’s embedded into its design, unlike Siri and Alexa which were designed initially to perform small day-to-day tasks which don’t require long responses and are now being tweaked to add the capability of giving longer responses when needed.\nAs we said in the beginning, ChatGPT is meant for an altogether different kind of use case than Alexa or Siri, and those use cases are precisely the areas in which it beats Alexa and Siri hands down. They include the following, in ChatGPT’s own words:\nDo you see that? ChatGPT can be used to build human-like AI chatbots, content creation platforms, content recommendation tools, translation tools, etc. Siri and Alexa would fare very poorly in all these use cases when compared to ChatGPT. And since we already have 3 major personal assistants to help with similar tasks (Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant all are on the same spectrum), an assistant like ChatGPT which does something different was much needed.\nIn addition to that, ChatGPT users have also said that it can do some tasks that are pretty much impossible for Alexa and Siri. Those tasks include:\n- Helping in writing code for software and web development\n- Explaining complex subjects in laymen’s terms\n- Writing college assignments like essays\n- Writing cover letters for job applications.\nCan you think about Alexa or Siri doing any of these tasks without messing up? We can’t!\nRelated Read:\nOverall we can say that ChatGPT is a far better AI assistant than Alexa or Siri when you need help with serious office work.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Cream of tartar can be replaced with vinegar or lemon juice in a 1:2 ratio.", "reference_documents": ["Michelle Lee Photography/Getty Images\nBy Jessie Sheehan for Food Network Kitchen\nJessie Sheehan is a baker and cookbook author.\nCream of tartar is one of the most versatile ingredients in the baking aisle – making your cookies chewy, your egg whites billowy and your toilets sparkle (yup, it’s true). With a forever shelf-life that its spice section compatriots – cardamom, nutmeg and baking powder, we’re looking at you – can only dream about, it truly is a hero, not only when baking, but also when cleaning too (see above toilet reference if you don’t believe us). Cream of tartar is similar to both vinegar and lemon juice in its acidity, and each of them will work in its place, in a pinch. Below you will find answers to critical cream of tartar questions, such as what does cream of tartar actually do? What is cream of tartar used for? And with what can I replace cream of tartar if I run out? – among others that you will not want to miss.\nCream of tartar is a dry, powder-like, acidic byproduct of winemaking called for in a myriad of different baking recipes (from cookies to cakes to frosting). Grapes are a natural source of cream of tartar’s main ingredient: tartaric acid (hence the “tartar” in its name). And when tartaric acid is half neutralized with potassium hydroxide, cream of tartar is the result, crystalizing into a hard crust on the inside of wine barrels.\nCream of tartar is a multi-talented and highly skilled powder. It is perhaps most famous for adding flavor to cookies, as in the acidity it adds to snickerdoodles, providing them with their characteristic tang. It is also known for its ability to stabilize egg whites, as it prevents the egg proteins from bonding, resulting in a smooth, billowy meringue. But it also stops sugar from crystalizing, meaning it can do wonders for simple syrup, as well as the chewy texture of cookies (sugar crystallization in a cookie leads to crispiness, the enemy of chewy…). And, finally, it is a fantastic metal and porcelain cleaner. Just mix it with water, lemon juice or vinegar until a paste forms, and voila! Your kitchen (and bathroom) will sparkle like nobody’s business.\nLindasPhotography/Getty Images\nCream of tartar makes cookies chewy, as it precludes the sugar in the dough from crystalizing, which would lead to crispiness (ie: the opposite of chewiness). It can also add flavor, like in the case of snickerdoodles, which have cream of tartar to thank for their quintessentially tangy flavor – which marries beautifully with the warm cinnamon. And it stops cookies from browning, again due to how it reacts with sugar, which is why you may find it in a decorated sugar cookie recipe, as such cookies benefit from a white “canvas,” as opposed to a lightly browned one.\nBRETT STEVENS/Getty Images\nCream of tartar stabilizes the tiny bubbles in the egg whites, by precluding the egg proteins from sticking together. It thus speeds up the egg white whipping process and contributes to a stable, billowy, glossy meringue, perfect for cookies, topping pies, and folding into cake. The ratio is usually 1/8 teaspoon of cream of tartar for every egg white.\nA variety of different recipes call for cream of tartar, such as those that require beaten egg whites (meringue cookies, meringue-topped pies, and angel food cake); those for chewy cookies (snickerdoodles and some chocolate chip cookies); those for cookies that you do not want to brown (sugar cookies) and those for simple syrup.\nOne can’t actually make cream of tartar at home (but a little lemon juice or vinegar will work some similar cream of tartar magic in your baked goods), as it is quite literally a byproduct of the winemaking process.\nA good replacement for cream of tartar in baking is 1 teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice for every 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar.\nYou can substitute lemon juice for cream of tartar when making meringues. The substitution ratio is 1:2 — for your recipe's measurement of cream of tartar, use double that amount of lemon juice.\nKilito Chan/Getty Images\nIncredibly, cream of tartar will remove the dark brown coffee stains in the bottom of your favorite mug. Just add a pinch to the bottom of the mug, plus a few drops of water, create a little paste, let it sit a bit and then scrub. You can also use a cream of tartar-water paste to clean your toilet and your stainless-steel fridge.\nWe get it: it’s been a long time since you made anything with that cream of tartar sitting in your spice drawer, but after reading this, you’re ready. Never fear – cream of tartar lasts forever(ish) – nothing is “forever,” right? – as long as it is kept in a cool dark place.\nWant to watch cream of tartar in action? Check out some of the different recipes for which it is called – and then make them all.\nBrian Kennedy, 2013, Television Food Network, G.P. All Rights Reserved\nIt wouldn’t be a snickerdoodle (everyone’s favorite old-fashioned cinnamon cookie) without cream of tartar, which contributes chewiness and that quintessential tangy flavor.\nSteve Giralt Prop Stylist: Marina Malchin 917 751 2855\nWith their crispy exteriors and their marshmallow-like interiors, who doesn’t love a meringue? And thanks to a little cream of tartar, your egg whites will whip up perfectly every time.\nLucy Schaeffer\nCream of tartar helps to stabilize the meringue batter, so it bakes into an airy, lofty cake.\nLevi Brown\nThe crisp, ethereal cookies you know and love have egg whites to thank for their texture.

For other uses, see Krishna (disambiguation) .\nThe Krishna River is a river in the Deccan plateau and is the third-longest river in India, after the Ganges and Godavari . It is also the fourth-largest in terms of water inflows and river basin area in India, after the Ganges, Indus and Godavari. [4] The river, also called Krishnaveni, it is 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) long and its length in Maharashtra is 282 kilometres. [5] It is a major source of irrigation in the Indian states of Maharashtra , Karnataka , Telangana and Andhra Pradesh . [6]\nThe Krishna River originates in the Western Ghats near Mahabaleshwar at an elevation of about 1,300 metres (4,300 ft), in the state of Maharashtra in central India. From Mahabaleshwar it flows to the town of Wai and continues to travel east until it empties into the Bay of Bengal. [7] The Krishna River passes through the Indian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. [8] It is around 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) in length, of which 305 km (190 mi) flows in Maharashtra, 483 km (300 mi) in Karnataka and 612 km (380 mi) in Andhra Pradesh. [9]\nThe Krishna River has 13 major tributaries. [9] Its principal tributaries include the Ghataprabha River , Malaprabha River , Bhima River , Tungabhadra River and Musi River . [9] The Tungabhadra River has a catchment area of 71,417 km 2 (27,574 sq mi) and a length of 531 km (330 mi). [9] The Bhima River is the longest tributary of the Krishna River. [7] It has a total length of 861 km (535 mi) and catchment area of 70,614 km 2 (27,264 sq mi). [9]\nThree tributaries Panchganga , Warna and Yerla meet Krishna river near Sangli . These places are considered very holy. It is said that Lord Dattatreya spent some of his days at Audumber on the banks of river Krishna.\nKudalasangama [10] (also written as Kudala Sangama) is located about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the Almatti Dam in Bagalkot district of Karnataka state. The Krishna and Malaprabha rivers merge here. The Aikya Mantapa or the holy Samādhi of Basavanna , the founder of the Lingayat sect of Hindu religion along with Linga , which is believed to be self-born ( Swayambhu ), is here and river flow east towards Srisailam (another pilgrim center) Andhra Pradesh.\nSangameswaram of Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh is a famous pilgrim center for Hindus where Tungabhadra and Bhavanasi rivers join the Krishna river. The Sangameswaram temple is now drowned in the Srisailam reservoir, and visible for devotees only during summer when the reservoir's water level comes down.

This large basin lies in the states of Karnataka (113,271 km 2 ), Telangana, Andhra Pradesh (76,252 km 2 ) and Maharashtra (69,425 km 2 ). [13] It is the fifth largest basin in India. [7]\nMost of this basin comprises rolling and undulating country, except for the western border, which is formed by an unbroken line of the Western Ghats. The important soil types found in the basin are black soils, red soils, laterite and lateritic soils, alluvium, mixed soils, red and black soils and saline and alkaline soils.\nAn average annual surface water potential of 78.1 km 3 has been assessed in this basin. Out of this, 58.0 km 3 is utilizable water. [14] Culturable area in the basin is about 203,000 km 2 (78,000 sq mi), which is 10.4% of the total cultivable area of the country. As the water availability in the Krishna river was becoming inadequate to meet the water demand, Godavari River is linked to the Krishna river by commissioning the Polavaram right bank canal with the help of Pattiseema lift scheme in the year 2015 to augment water availability to the Prakasam Barrage in Andhra Pradesh. [15] The irrigation canals of Prakasam Barrage form part of National Waterway 4 . The Krishna-Godavari delta known as \"Rice Granary of India . \" [16]\nThis river is revered by Hindus as sacred. The river is also believed to remove all sins of people by taking a bath in this river. The centre of attraction is the Krishna Pushkaram fair which is held once in twelve years on the banks of the Krishna river. There are many pilgrimage places in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on the course of the river. [ citation needed ]\nThe first holy place on the river Krishna is at Wai , known for the Mahaganpati Mandir and Kashivishweshwar temple. It has seven ghats along the river. Temples like Dattadeva temple, which is revered by the people of Maharashtra, are located on the banks of Krishna at Narsobawadi , Bhilawdi Audumbar near Sangli . Yadur is one of the important holy places in Karnataka which is located on the bank of Krishna. Veerabhadra temple is a famous temple. Many devotees visit this place from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Also, located on the banks of the river Krishna is the Sangameshwar Shiva temple at Haripur. Some of the other temples are the Kanaka Durga Temple in Vijayawada , Ramling temple near Sangli, Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga (Srisailam), Amareshwara Swamy Temple , Vedadri Narasimha Temple , Vadapalli temple in Nalgonda , Dattadeva temple, and Sangameshwara Shiva temples at Alampur & Gadwal in Telangana. [ citation needed ]\nBhilawadi town in Maharashtra has a large stone structure constructed across Krishna river bank, also known as Krishna Ghat. This structure also includes one large and one small temple constructed in the middle of the river. This structure is believed to be constructed in 1779. [17]\nThe Krishna River is spanned by several bridges along its course, some of which are listed below.\n- Krishna Bridge, Wai , Maharashtra – This bridge, which is located in the Dharmpuri Peth area of the town of Wai, is one of the oldest bridges that were built by the British in India. It spans the Krishna over nine kamans (arches) and is made of black rock. The bridge serves as a flood mark (when the water rises to the level of the road on the bridge) for the \"Waikar\" people.\n- Irwin Bridge, Sangli – This is one of the oldest, historic and largest bridges over the Krishna that were built by the British. The Irwin Bridge, which is built of reddish stone, has two passages where one can climb down to the river in the middle of its span to view the water.\n- Ankali Bridge, Sangli Maharashtra – This bridge is major link between Sangli and Kolhapur districts. At this point there are three bridge, one for railway and two for roadways. Out of two roadway bridge the one bridge in the direction towards Miraj was built in Nineteenth century under British Administration. It is still in operation. The railway bridge was constructed at the time of laying of Kolhapur to Pune rail link. The contractor for rail bridge was V. R. Ranade & Sons from Pune. The construction of this railway bridge and culverts on railway route in nearby region were constructed by them in year 1882–84.\n- Kudachi – Ugar Railway bridge built by the British in 1891.\n- B. Soundatti Bridge, Raibag – This is also one of the oldest bridges built during the British rule. This bridge connects Maharashtra to Karnataka state.\n- Tangadagi Bridge, This is one of oldest bridges that connects the Bijapur and Bagalkot districts of Karnataka.

The bridge was named after the prince as Sirat-e-joodi. The construction began in 1933 and completed in 1943 [18]\nIn October 2009, heavy floods occurred, isolating 350 villages and leaving millions homeless, [19] which is believed to be first occurrence in 1000 years. The flood resulted in heavy damage to Kurnool, Mahabubnagar, Guntur, Krishna and Nalagonda Districts. The entire city of Kurnool was immersed in approximately 10 ft (3 m) water for nearly 3 days. [20]\nWater inflow of 1,110,000 cu ft/s (31,000 m 3 /s) was recorded at the Prakasam Barriage, which surpassed the previous record of 1,080,000 cu ft/s (31,000 m 3 /s) recorded in the year 1903. [21] Krishna river is the second largest east flowing river of the peninsula. The flood waters of Krishna and Godavari rivers can be fully utilized by exporting water to other east flowing peninsular rivers up to Vaigai River in Tamil Nadu by constructing a coastal reservoir on the Bay of Bengal sea area.\nThe yearly water outflows to the sea in a water year from 1 June 2003 to 31 May 2022 (19 years) are given below\n|Water year||03-04||04-05||05-06||06-07||07-08||08-09||09-10||10-11||11-12||12-13||13-14||14-15||15-16||16-17||17-18||18-19||19-20||20-21||21-22|\n|Water outflows ( tmcft )||5||14||113||968||885||296||437||407||215||56||394||73||9||55||0||39||798||1252||485|\nAt present, the award of Bachawat tribunal dated 31 May 1976 is applicable for sharing the water available in the river among the riparian states. The Brijesh Kumar tribunal award given on 29 November 2013 is challenged by Andhra Pradesh in the Supreme Court and the case pending since then.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Supervised practice teaching and passing state examinations, including a general test for all teachers plus a chemistry certification exam, is also required.", "reference_documents": ["By\nChron Contributor\nUpdated September 04, 2020\nThe American Chemical Society reports that high school science teachers are in demand, particularly those who can teach chemistry and physics. Secondary school chemistry teachers need a minimum of a bachelor's degree, and those who teach in public schools must fulfill additional state requirements, which may mean graduate credits or a master's degree. Chemistry teachers need graduate degrees to teach at the college level.\nThe basic requirement for high school chemistry teachers is a bachelor's degree in chemistry. As explained on the employment website ZipRecruiter , a state-issued teaching certificate is mandatory to teach in the public schools. Requirements vary by state so it's important to check with an academic advisor to be sure you're taking all the necessary courses.\nSample courses for a chemistry degree include biology, physics, calculus, general chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry and chemistry labs. In addition, teacher preparation includes classes in psychology, instructional techniques and methods of dealing with students. Prospective teachers must complete supervised practice teaching and pass state examinations. For chemistry teachers, these typically include a general test for all teachers plus a chemistry certification exam.\nMany chemistry teachers also have master's degrees in education or chemistry. Some states require teachers to complete a master's degree as part of the final certification process. In addition, alternative certification programs often award master's degrees. In these programs, students who already have bachelor's degrees take education classes and do supervised student teaching to become certified. Alternately, bachelor's degree graduates can qualify to teach in two-year colleges and technical schools by completely a master's in chemistry.\nMost four-year colleges and universities require teachers to have a doctorate in the field they teach, although sometimes part-time jobs go to those with master's degrees. A Ph.D. degree in chemistry usually takes six years beyond the bachelor's degree and includes both supervised research and specialized coursework.\nThe employment website PayScale reports that chemistry teachers earned an average of $50,017 per year as of 2020, with typical salaries ranging between $36,000 and $77,000 . Pay varies state to state and even among school districts within a state. Other factors affecting salary include level of education and number of years in the teaching profession.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), jobs for high school teachers overall will grow by 4 percent through 2029, a rate considered average when compared to other jobs.. Chemistry teachers, however, will have better prospects than most because of the scarcity of qualified applicants.\nFor post-secondary teachers, the BLS predicts a 9 percent job growth rate through 2029, which is much faster than average growth. As is the case with high school jobs, those qualified to teach chemistry may have even more opportunities than teachers of other subjects. According to the BLS, the 2019 median pay for postsecondary teachers was $79,540 . Median salary means that half in the profession earned more, while half earned less.\nReferences\nResources"], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Apart from physical injuries, a dog attack survivor can also experience many lasting psychological effects such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).", "reference_documents": ["A dog attack can be one of the most gruesome and traumatic incidents for victims and bystanders. The nature of a dog attack can be highly psychologically scarring. It can also leave behind physical scarring and disfigurement. Even a minor dog bite could become infected and cause health complications. The Nebraska courts recognize a dog bite victim’s right to file a claim for compensation for the long-term effects of an injury.\nIt is critical to treat a dog bite injury immediately after it happens. Waiting can increase the risks of the bite festering and becoming infected. Bacterial infections are common with dog bite injuries due to bacteria living in the dog’s mouth. The victim needs to go to a doctor, urgent care center or hospital for prompt treatment. Dog bite treatment may include wound debridement to rid it of dirt and debris, flushing out the wound, administering antibacterial ointments and antibiotics to prevent infection, and bandaging the wound to encourage proper healing. A dog bite victim might have an infection if he or she notices certain symptoms.\n- Redness, especially in streaks\n- Swelling around the wound\n- Drainage, such as pus\n- Pain lasting longer than 24 hours\n- Trouble moving the injured part of the body\n- Warmth coming from the wound\n- Fever and night sweats\nAny possible symptoms of infection require medical attention. Before leaving the scene of the attack, a victim should ask the pet’s owner if the dog is up to date on its shots. Without proper vaccinations, serious complications could arise from a dog bite injury, including rabies and tetanus. These are potentially deadly diseases in humans. Even if the dog does not transfer any bacteria, the victim could experience other long-term health consequences from a deep bite. These can include broken or splintered bones, nerve damage, and muscle damage. Going to a hospital can help prevent these types of long-term complications with adequate treatments.\nSadly, many dog attacks inflict wounds that permanently scar, disfigure or maim the victim. A serious dog attack can cause injuries such as lacerations, puncture wounds and avulsions, or the tearing away of skin. Some victims, especially children, suffer these injuries in visible and vulnerable places such as the face. Victims may require stitches, skin grafts, plastic surgery or surgeries to try to minimize the amount of scarring and disfigurement from the dog attack. The scars a victim has, however, can be permanent.\nThe long-term effects of a dog bite are not only physical. A dog attack survivor can also experience many lasting psychological effects. A common psychological outcome of a dog bite is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD can come with symptoms such as nightmares, intrusive flashbacks, severe anxiety, fear, stress, depression and trouble sleeping. PTSD from a dog attack can affect both the victim and any bystanders who witnessed the incident – especially those who had personal relationships with the victim.\nAnother common psychological effect that could last long after the attack – in some cases, for the victim’s life – is a phobia of dogs.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The 2019 Cricket World Cup was won by England, who beat New Zealand.", "reference_documents": ["From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nCricket World Cup is an international cricket competition established in 1975. [1] It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's global governing body. [2] The tournament generally takes place every four years. Most recently, the 2019 Cricket World Cup , hosted by England and Wales, was won by England, who beat New Zealand. The current trophy was instituted in 1999. It always remains with the ICC, and a replica is awarded to the winning team. [3] [4]\nFor the 2019 and 2023 World Cups, the host nation and the seven other highest-ranked nations automatically qualify for the World Cup, while other nations including associate and affiliate ICC members play in a qualification tournament, the World Cup Qualifier . Though an associate member is yet to reach the final, Kenya did reach the semi-finals in 2003. [5] Australia is the most successful team in the competition's history, winning five tournaments and finishing as runner-up twice. [6] Twice, teams have won successive tournaments: the West Indies won the first two editions ( 1975 and 1979 ) and Australia won three in a row ( 1999 , 2003 and 2007 ). Australia has played in the most finals (seven out of twelve: 1975 , 1987 , 1996 , 1999 , 2003 , 2007 , 2015 ). England is the team to reach the final and not win the World Cup most often, ending as runner-up in all three final appearances before their victory in the 2019 tournament. [7] [8]\nOf the twenty teams that have qualified for at least one Cricket World Cup, seven have contested a tournament final. [9] Seven venues have hosted the final; only two of those – Lord's , in London, and the Melbourne Cricket Ground – have hosted multiple finals. [10] India is the only country that has hosted a World Cup final at more than one venue, with Eden Gardens , Kolkata , hosting in 1987 and Mumbai 's Wankhede Stadium hosting in 2011.\nThe inaugural ICC Cricket World Cup final was held on 21 June 1975 at Lord's , contested by Australia and the West Indies. A man of the match performance, [11] including a century , from West Indian captain Clive Lloyd , coming in to bat at number five with his team at 50/3, [12] formed the basis of a 149-run fourth-wicket partnership with Rohan Kanhai . [13] Keith Boyce added a quick 34 and the Australians were set a target of 292 to win in 60 overs. In reply, Alan Turner hit 40 from 54 deliveries and Australian captain Ian Chappell scored 62 from 93 balls. Australia \"contributed to their own destruction\" in an innings with five run outs , and the West Indies were crowned the first cricket world champions, winning by 17 runs. [14]\nFour years later, the West Indies qualified for the final, this time facing England, hosted at Lord's for the second consecutive tournament. An unbeaten 138 from Viv Richards , and support from Collis King in a 139-run partnership for the fifth wicket, [15] saw the West Indies set England a target of 287 runs to win in 60 overs. [16] A profitable but slow opening partnership between Mike Brearley and Geoffrey Boycott (the latter taking 17 overs to reach double figures) [17] saw England to 129. However, following Brearley's dismissal, only Graham Gooch and Derek Randall made a \"brief assault\" on the West Indian bowling, [17] before a batting collapse, Joel Garner taking five wickets in eleven balls. [18] England ended 194 all out, and presented the West Indies with their second consecutive title, winning by 92 runs. [17]\nLord's hosted the third World Cup final in June 1983; this was West Indies' third consecutive final. This time they faced India in front of 24,609 spectators. [19] Sunil Gavaskar was dismissed early in the innings for two runs, and only Kris Srikkanth scored more than thirty; [20] Andy Roberts took three wickets for the West Indies, leaving India all out for 183. [20] After the dismissals of Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes and Larry Gomes by Madan Lal for six runs between them, the West Indies collapsed to 140 all out, handing the title to India by 43 runs. [19] India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 tournament; the final was held at Eden Gardens in Kolkata between Australia and England, both appearing for the second time and vying for their first title. Australia won the toss and elected to bat first; David Boon scored 75 runs from 125 deliveries, while Mike Veletta made a rapid 45 from 31 deliveries, taking Australia to a total of 253/5 by the close of play, this time after 50 overs. [21] In front of around 70,000 spectators, England's middle order of Bill Athey , Mike Gatting and Allan Lamb provided some resistance, but with 17 runs required in the final over to win, England fell short and lost by 7 runs. [22]\nThe 1992 tournament was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, with the first ever day/night final being held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia between England and Pakistan . In their first final appearance, Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat first. Despite two early wickets from Derek Pringle , Pakistani batsmen Imran Khan and Javed Miandad shared a third-wicket partnership of 139. Both Inzamam-ul-Haq and Wasim Akram added over thirty runs each at more than a run-a-ball, leading Pakistan to a total of 249/6 in 50 overs. [23] A crowd of over 87,000 saw man-of-the-match Wasim Akram take three of England's wickets, including that of all-rounder Ian Botham for a duck , after Graeme Hick was \"baffled by the googly \". [24] England were bowled out for 227, and Pakistan won by 22 runs. [23]\nIndia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka hosted the tournament in 1996. It was Sri Lanka's first appearance in the final, and they faced 1987 champions Australia in another day/night contest. After winning the toss, Arjuna Ranatunga sent Australia in to bat at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore . Captain Mark Taylor and Ricky Ponting added 101 in their second-wicket partnership as Australia completed their 50 overs with 241/7. [25] Man of the match Aravinda de Silva 's century, assisted by partnerships with Asanka Gurusinha and Ranatunga, led Sri Lanka to the target with 22 balls and 7 wickets to spare, and their first win in the final. This was the first time a host won the title, though the final was played in Pakistan. It was also the first time that the team batting second emerged victorious. [25]\nAustralia's \"12-year era of World Cup dominance\" began with the 1999 tournament, [26] hosted for the fourth time by England. In a \"one-sided\" final at Lord's, [27] Shane Warne 's four wickets helped to restrict Pakistan to 132 runs, all out with 11 overs yet to bat. [28] A rapid fifty from Adam Gilchrist , and support from Mark Waugh , Ponting and Darren Lehmann , saw Australia reach the total in just over 20 overs, winning by eight wickets. [28]\nThe 2003 tournament had three co-hosts: South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe, the final being a day/night match contested between Australia and India at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden opened the batting, making a century partnership, before Ponting and Damien Martin went on to score the highest partnership in any World Cup final with an unbeaten 234. [29] Australia batted out their fifty overs, and ended on the highest score in World Cup final history: 359/2. [30] Player of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar was dismissed in the first over of India's reply but Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid combined to score 88 in their fourth wicket partnership. However, following Dravid's dismissal, India's batting collapsed, and they finished on 234 all out with nearly eleven overs remaining, handing Australia a 125-run victory. [30]\nThe 2007 final, held at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, was reduced to 38 overs a side following a two-hour rain delay. [31] Australia's Gilchrist hit the fastest century in a World Cup final at a strike rate of over 143 and his opening stand with Hayden became the largest first-wicket partnership in World Cup history. [29] Australia ended on 281/4, an average of 7.39 runs per over. [32] In reply, Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara accumulated 116 runs for the second wicket, but with Chamara Silva the only other batsman to score over 20, Sri Lanka capitulated. Despite a revised target, due to a further rain break, calculated using the Duckworth–Lewis method , Sri Lanka scored 215–8 from their allotted overs. With a 53-run victory, Australia won their third consecutive World Cup. [32] Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka co-hosted the 2011 tournament, [33] with the latter pair meeting in the final in the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai . Scoring 91 runs in their final 10 overs, [34] Sri Lanka's innings ended on 274/6, Mahela Jayawardene top-scoring with an unbeaten 103. [35] Sehwag was out leg before wicket to Lasith Malinga in the second ball of the Indian innings; Tendulkar soon followed him, but 97 from Gautam Gambhir and an unbeaten 91 from MS Dhoni saw India home with 10 balls to spare. By winning the match, India became the first team to win the finals on home soil. [35]\nThe 2015 final, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, was won by hosts Australia. Their fast bowlers ripped through the New Zealand team, with Mitchell Starc bowling Brendon McCullum out for a duck and Mitchell Johnson taking three wickets. Despite the efforts of Grant Elliot, New Zealand were bowled out for 183. Steven Smith and Michael Clarke registered half-centuries as Australia won their fifth World Cup.\nFour years later, the 2019 final, held at Lord's, was won by hosts England. England, playing in their first final in 27 years, defeated New Zealand to take the trophy.\n|The final was played as a day/night game .|\n|The final was decided by the Duckworth–Lewis method .|\n- The ‘Year’ column refers to the year the World Cup was held, and links to the article about that tournament.\n- The links in the ‘Result’ column point to the article about that tournament's final game.\n- Links in the ’Winners’ and ’Runners-up’ columns point to the articles for the national cricket teams of the countries, not the articles for the countries.\n|Year||Winner||Winner's score|| Winning |\nmargin\n|Runner-up||R/Up's score||Final venue||Host nation(s) [2]||Crowd|\n|1975||West Indies||291/8 (60 overs)||17 runs [11]||Australia||274 all out (58.4 overs)||Lord's , London||England||24,000|\n|1979||West Indies||286/9 (60 overs)||92 runs [16]||England||194 all out (51 overs)||Lord's , London||England||32,000|\n|1983||India||183 all out (55th over)||43 runs [20]||West Indies||140 all out (52 overs)||Lord's , London||England||30,000|\n|1987||Australia||253/5 (50 overs)||7 runs [21]||England||246/8 (50 overs)||Eden Gardens , Kolkata||India, Pakistan||95,000|\n|1992||Pakistan||249/6 (50 overs)||22 runs [23]||England||227 all out (49.2 overs)||MCG , Melbourne||Australia, New Zealand||87,182|\n|1996||Sri Lanka||245/3 (46.2 overs)||7 wickets [25]||Australia||241/7 (50 overs)||Gaddafi Stadium , Lahore||Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka||62,645|\n|1999||Australia||133/2 (20.1 overs)||8 wickets [28]||Pakistan||132 all out (39 overs)||Lord's , London||England||30,000|\n|2003||Australia||359/2 (50 overs)||125 runs [30]||India||234 all out (39.2 overs)||Wanderers , Johannesburg||South Africa||32,827|\n|2007||Australia||281/4 (38 overs)||53 runs [32]||Sri Lanka||215/8 (36 overs)||Kensington Oval , Barbados||West Indies||28,108|\n|2011||India||277/4 (48.2 overs)||6 wickets [35]||Sri Lanka||274/6 (50 overs)||Wankhede Stadium , Mumbai||India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh||42,000|\n|2015||Australia||186/3 (33.1 overs)||7 wickets [36]||New Zealand||183 all out (45 overs)||MCG , Melbourne||Australia, New Zealand||93,013|\n|2019||England||241 all out (50 overs)||Tiebreak: 9 fours||New Zealand||241/8 (50 overs)||Lord's , London||England, Wales||N/A|\nNote: the World Cups hosted by England (1983, 1999) and South Africa (2003) also had some matches played in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Netherlands, Zimbabwe and Kenya\n|National team||Final appearances||Winners||Runners-up||Years won||Years runners-up|\n|Australia||7||5||2||1987 , 1999 , 2003 , 2007 , 2015||1975 , 1996|\n|India||3||2||1||1983 , 2011||2003|\n|West Indies||3||2||1||1975 , 1979||1983|\n|England||4||1||3||2019||1979 , 1987 , 1992|\n|Sri Lanka||3||1||2||1996||2007 , 2011|\n|Pakistan||2||1||1||1992||1999|\n|New Zealand||2||0||2||-||2015 , 2019|\n- ^\n- ^\n- ^\n- ^\n- ^\n- ^"], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The current president of Austria is Dr. Alexander Van der Bellen, who was inaugurated in 2017 and will serve for a term of six years.", "reference_documents": ["Last update on 17/01/2023\nWritten by Alicia Walker\nFrom the main political parties and electoral system to the judiciary system and economy, we explain the Austrian government and political system.\nWhen you are considering moving to another country, it is important to know how the government and political system in that country works. It is also a good idea to grasp an understanding of the crime and legal system as well as human and civil rights , women’s rights , and LGBTQI rights . After all, these may be determining factors when it comes to deciding whether or not to move there at all.\nTo help you learn the basics of the Austrian government and political system, this handy guide outlines the following information:\nAustria is a democratic republic. The territory of the Federal Republic consists of nine federal states, and Vienna is the federal capital. Since 1995, Austria has also been a member state of the European Union. The Austrian constitution allows for popular initiatives ( Volksbegehren ), by which 200,000 vote-eligible citizens or half the populations of three states can petition parliament for approval of any bill . Furthermore, this can be initiated by a majority of the National Council .\nAustria’s current government is a first for the nation with a Conservative-Green coalition, which caters to the people while also combatting serious issues like climate change. Interestingly, neighboring countries in the EU are watching closely as a possible model for their nations. Essentially, all elections in Austria promise an equal, direct, free, secret, personal, and universal right to vote. Austria sits high, at number 16, on the Economist Intelligence Unit’s annual Democracy Index .\nAdvertisement\nDr. Alexander Van der Bellen is currently Federal President of the Republic of Austria ( Bundespräsident ) and head of state. He was inaugurated in 2017 and will serve for a term of six years. He also represents the first time a former Green Party leader has ever been elected to the presidency. The president is elected by the people of Austria.\nIn 2020, the Austrian Federal Government was formed by the conservative Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) and the ecologist Green Party . Again, the new Government is helmed by Federal Chancellor Karl Nehammer . The Green Party head Werner Kogler is Vice-Chancellor. This is the first time there has been a Conservative-Green coalition government in Austria. For the first time in Austrian history , women are also a majority among cabinet ministers.\nAdvertisement\nThere are currently five main political parties in the Austrian Parliament and below is an overview of each one.\nThe ÖVP is the follow-on to the Christian Social Party that began in the 1890s. It represents a combination of conservative forces along with a mix of social and economic groups that form semi-independent federations within the party. These include workers, farmers, employers, tradespeople, feminists, and senior citizens. The opposing interests within these disparate groups make for evident difficulty within the party on a regular basis.\nSince December 2021, the party has been provisionally led by Karl Nehammer. The former Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, took on many of the ideals of its former coalition partner, The Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), adding many anti-immigration policies to its platform.\nCurrently, it is the largest party in the National Council. It holds 71 of the 183 seats and won 37.5% of votes cast in the 2019 legislative election.\nOriginally, the SPÖ was founded in 1945. Since then, the party has gone through an evolution from a democratic Marxist doctrine to a less ideological approach. The correction of social problems, a socially-oriented economy, employment for all, and an increase in the standard of living are all priorities. It has also expanded its appeal outside the realm of the working class to include the middle classes. It also has a pro-European stance. Along with the ÖVP, it is one of the two major political parties in Austria.\nSince 2018, Pamela Rendi-Wagner has been at the head of the party which holds 40 of the 183 seats . Additionally, the SPÖ won 21.2% of the votes in the 2019 legislative election.\nThe FPÖ has been around since 1955 as a successor to the League of Independents which has close associations with the Nazis. Later, in the 1980s, it made up a coalition government with the SPÖ after largely changing its ideological principles. Then, in the late 1980s, the party went back to its roots under party leader Jörg Haider and found widespread electoral success with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Although Haider has since died, the FPÖ continues as a controversial, yet still influential, force.\nHerbert Kickl has led the party since 2021. It is the third-largest of five parties in the National Council, with 30 of the 183 seats . Additionally, it won 16.2% of the votes in the 2019 election.\nCollectively known as the Greens , the two environmentalist parties of Austria banded together to win their first seats in 1986. Along with ecological issues, the Greens platform for direct democracy, feminism, LGBTQ+, and other minority rights, and non-violence. The new government coalition with the ÖVP is, therefore, an uneasy alliance with its developing anti-immigration policies.\nThe new coalition is the first time the Greens will enter politics on a national level, after being shut out of parliament in 2017. The Greens won 13.9% of the votes and 26 seats in the 2019 election.\nInitially starting out in 2012, The New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS) is a Liberal party in Austria. It is also the smallest party in the National Council. Currently, the NEOS leader is Beate Meinl-Reisinger and the party holds 15 seats, winning 8.3% of the votes in the 2019 legislative election.\nThe Austrian Parliament is the bicameral federal legislature of the Austrian Republic. It holds the National Council with 183 members and the Federal Council with 61 members .\nEssentially, the National Council holds elections every five years through open party lists. Additionally, there are nine multi-member constituencies that represent each of the nine states. There are also 39 local electoral districts. The Federal Council holds elections through provincial assemblies and its powers have large limitations.\nAdvertisement\nCurrently, the voting age in Austria is 16. Generally, you must be an Austrian citizen to vote. However, in European elections and municipal elections, citizens of EU member states may also vote.\nEssentially, Austria has among the highest proportions of foreign residents in the European Union. However, almost a third of the residents of Vienna are unable to vote outside of their local district elections because they are foreigners. Recently, protests and criticism have highlighted the situation.\nIn Austria, you don’t need to apply for registration to vote. All citizens with a permanent residence in the country are kept in a permanent municipal register. Currently, it is not compulsory to vote. All elections follow the principles of a universal, equal, direct, free, secret, and personal right to vote.\nAdvertisement\nEssentially, all Austrian citizens who turn 18 on election day have the right to be elected with a passive voting right. An Austrian citizen will only lose this right if they were convicted of a criminal offense exceeding one year of imprisonment. Interestingly, EU expats can represent Austria as a member of the European Parliament. They can even found a new party. However, only an Austrian citizen may run for office on that party’s platform.\nIn essence, regional authorities rely on a number of bodies to complete their tasks. In Austria, the municipal council offices and city administrations consist of political representatives elected for a term of office. Elections are built on proportional representation, a closed list system, and preferential votes. All groups campaigning need supportive signatures by three members of the National Council; or 2,600 declarations of support in order to run nationwide for national parliamentary elections.\nAustrian citizens elect the National Assembly every five years, the Provincial Parliament every five or six years, and the Municipal Council every five or six years. Additionally, they elect the Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and the Federal President, every six years.\nThe government in Austria has been a stable model of democracy since 1945 when it was deemed as the Second Republic. Austria’s commitment to neutrality post-war was also solidified in a pledge in 1955 to never join a military alliance or allow foreign troops into the country.\nAustria has regularly participated in United Nations peacekeeping missions thereafter.\nAfter World War II, the Austrian government has consisted of periodic coalitions that have ruled the country together. From 1945 to 1966, the two major parties (the ÖVP and the SPÖ) ruled. The SPÖ changed its name in 1991 from the Socialist Party of Austria to the Social Democratic Party of Austria (still SPÖ) after it had been banned after being suppressed during the Nazi period. The Austrian government found many benefits to the arrangement, as it was able to combine economic and professionals in alignment with two major parties.\nLater, in the mid-80s, the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) became popular and greater changes came as a result. However, environmental concerns also became a greater concern and the Greens made more headway than ever before. After, in the late 1980s, support by politicians to join the European Community was growing. Consequently, in the summer of 1989, the Austrian government put in a formal application to join.\nThe Second Kurz government later came into play to take over for the nonpartisan caretaker administration of 2019. This had held the fort after the collapse of the First Kurz government due to its FPÖ coalition partner scandal (see Ibiza affair further below). Significantly, after the scandal, there was a sharp decline in voter support for the FPÖ. Consequently, the highest ever surge in support for the Greens came about. However, the ÖVP still won the election. That said, the win was without a parliamentary majority. Therefore, the need for a coalition partner arose.\nThis colorful political history leads up to the current shake-up of the Austrian government – the ÖVP-Greens partnership – which was born in 2020. Remarkably, this is a first-time coalition of the two parties that have mostly disparate views on policies. The world is watching to see if these two parties can truly unite to create a stable and environmentally sound future for the country.\nIn October 2021, Sebastian Kurz resigned from his position as Chancellor following a corruption investigation. Alexander Schallenberg took over until December 2021, when Karl Nehammer replaced him.\nEssentially, the justice system in Austria stems from the federal level and court judgments are made in the name of the Republic. You will notice that it is very similar to other nations, with the judicial authority being split into four levels. Firstly, there are the Bezirksgericht (district courts). Secondly, come the Landesgericht (regional courts). Next, are the Oberlandesgericht (Higher Regional Court) as the next rung on the ladder. And finally, the Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court) sits at the very top.\nThen, there is the Verwaltungsgericht (Administrative Court) which deals with all disputes that arise in connection with decisions by the administrative authorities. Additionally, there is the Verfassungsgerichtshof (Constitutional Court) which deals with actions against federal, provincial, regional, or municipal authorities.\nImportantly, judges in Austria are independent in the actions of their office. Both civil and criminal law proceedings are public. Final appeals go to the Supreme Court. In essence, the judiciary is separate from the executive at all levels. Conversely, the police are subject to the Republic of Austria.\nIn essence, the new coalition government signifies a large political shift within Austria. The Greens are now in partnership with the ÖVP, taking the place of the FPÖ after a corruption scandal nicknamed the ‘ Ibiza scandal ‘. It involves the deputy chancellor and head of the FPÖ party verbally agreeing to an unethical exchange with the niece of a Russian oligarch.\nHowever, much of the country agrees with the FPÖ’s anti-immigration stance, which the current government is also making a priority with preventive detention and restrictive migration. Previously, the Greens have stood for liberal migration policies.

Additionally, it is committed to the generation of electricity through 100% renewable energy sources by 2030 . Furthermore, the government will implement a tax on CO2 emissions by mid-2022 .\nAustria officially joined the European Union in 1995. The country is also a founding member of the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) that came into play in 1960.\nInterestingly, various studies prove that the Austrian economy benefits largely from its participation in the EU. For example, some 69% of Austria’s foreign trade is with fellow EU member states. Furthermore, exports have tripled since joining and 13,000 new jobs are created each year.\nThe citizens of Austria, in particular, benefit from being in the EU . This includes free borderless travel throughout Europe, European study possibilities, the right to settle in all member states, and the ease of having the common euro currency. However, in the context of the refugee and migrant crisis that peaked in 2015, there are also ongoing debates over whether Austria or the EU should handle border control.\nThere are 19 members of the European Parliament from Austria. Austria also has permanent representation in Brussels to ease communication with the EU. European Union issues also feature prominently on the agenda of Austria’s foreign policy. Austrian voters also participate in European elections as members of the European Union.\nAustria boasts a well-developed social market economy. Overall, the country’s economy is among the highest in Europe. However, it has, along with most of the world, been hit hard by the recent health crisis that came in the form of the coronavirus pandemic. The economic summary on Austria outlined by OECD states that decisive action by the government has helped safeguard jobs during the difficult year that was 2020.\nAustria has a low percentage of unemployment in comparison to other EU countries and the rest of the world. However, the rate increased significantly in 2020 and will likely remain higher than usual. The OECD estimates that the GDP will contract by 8% in 2020 and only pick up gradually over the coming two years. Essentially, a generous support package has brought on a large budget deficit.\nPreviously, the Austrian economy has had a high performance over recent decades. Reportedly, the real GDP per capita was the 11th highest in the OECD and 6th highest in the EU in 2018.

In a deadpan first-person narrative that rarely shows any signs of self-reflection or deep emotional response, Gulliver narrates the adventures that befall him on these travels.\nGulliver’s adventure in Lilliput begins when he wakes after his shipwreck to find himself bound by innumerable tiny threads and addressed by tiny captors who are in awe of him but fiercely protective of their kingdom. They are not afraid to use violence against Gulliver, though their arrows are little more than pinpricks. But overall, they are hospitable, risking famine in their land by feeding Gulliver, who consumes more food than a thousand Lilliputians combined could. Gulliver is taken into the capital city by a vast wagon the Lilliputians have specially built. He is presented to the emperor, who is entertained by Gulliver, just as Gulliver is flattered by the attention of royalty. Eventually Gulliver becomes a national resource, used by the army in its war against the people of Blefuscu, whom the Lilliputians hate for doctrinal differences concerning the proper way to crack eggs. But things change when Gulliver is convicted of treason for putting out a fire in the royal palace with his urine and is condemned to be shot in the eyes and starved to death. Gulliver escapes to Blefuscu, where he is able to repair a boat he finds and set sail for England.\nAfter staying in England with his wife and family for two months, Gulliver undertakes his next sea voyage, which takes him to a land of giants called Brobdingnag. Here, a field worker discovers him. The farmer initially treats him as little more than an animal, keeping him for amusement. The farmer eventually sells Gulliver to the queen, who makes him a courtly diversion and is entertained by his musical talents. Social life is easy for Gulliver after his discovery by the court, but not particularly enjoyable. Gulliver is often repulsed by the physicality of the Brobdingnagians, whose ordinary flaws are many times magnified by their huge size. Thus, when a couple of courtly ladies let him play on their naked bodies, he is not attracted to them but rather disgusted by their enormous skin pores and the sound of their torrential urination. He is generally startled by the ignorance of the people here—even the king knows nothing about politics. More unsettling findings in Brobdingnag come in the form of various animals of the realm that endanger his life. Even Brobdingnagian insects leave slimy trails on his food that make eating difficult. On a trip to the frontier, accompanying the royal couple, Gulliver leaves Brobdingnag when his cage is plucked up by an eagle and dropped into the sea.\nNext, Gulliver sets sail again and, after an attack by pirates, ends up in Laputa, where a floating island inhabited by theoreticians and academics oppresses the land below, called Balnibarbi. The scientific research undertaken in Laputa and in Balnibarbi seems totally inane and impractical, and its residents too appear wholly out of touch with reality. Taking a short side trip to Glubbdubdrib, Gulliver is able to witness the conjuring up of figures from history, such as Julius Caesar and other military leaders, whom he finds much less impressive than in books. After visiting the Luggnaggians and the Struldbrugs, the latter of which are senile immortals who prove that age does not bring wisdom, he is able to sail to Japan and from there back to England.\nFinally, on his fourth journey, Gulliver sets out as captain of a ship, but after the mutiny of his crew and a long confinement in his cabin, he arrives in an unknown land. This land is populated by Houyhnhnms, rational-thinking horses who rule, and by Yahoos, brutish humanlike creatures who serve the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver sets about learning their language, and when he can speak he narrates his voyages to them and explains the constitution of England. He is treated with great courtesy and kindness by the horses and is enlightened by his many conversations with them and by his exposure to their noble culture. He wants to stay with the Houyhnhnms, but his bared body reveals to the horses that he is very much like a Yahoo, and he is banished. Gulliver is grief-stricken but agrees to leave. He fashions a canoe and makes his way to a nearby island, where he is picked up by a Portuguese ship captain who treats him well, though Gulliver cannot help now seeing the captain—and all humans—as shamefully Yahoolike. Gulliver then concludes his narrative with a claim that the lands he has visited belong by rights to England, as her colonies, even though he questions the whole idea of colonialism."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "It was also the capital of Egypt during the period of the New Kingdom (c.1570-c.1069 BCE) and frequently served as the royal capital of Egypt from this time.", "reference_documents": ["Thebes was the capital of Egypt during the period of the New Kingdom (c.1570-c.1069 BCE) and became an important center of worship of the god Amun (also known as Amon or Amen, a combination of the earlier gods Atum and Ra). Its sacred name was P-Amen or Pa-Amen meaning \"the abode of Amen\".\nIt was also known to the Egyptians as Wase or Wo'se (the city ) and Usast or Waset (the southern city) and was built on either side of the Nile River with the main city on the east bank and the vast necropolis on the west. This position on the river is famously referenced in the biblical book of Nahum 3:8, when the prophet warns Nineveh of its coming destruction, claiming that not even the great Thebes \"situated among rivers, the waters round about it\" was safe from the wrath of God. The biblical name for the city is No-Amon or No (Ezekial 30:14,16, Jeremiah 46:25, Nahum 3:8) referencing its fame as a cult center for Amon (though this name is also associated with the city of Xois in Lower Egypt). The Greeks called it Thebai from the Coptic Greek Ta-opet (the name of the great Karnak Temple ) which became 'Thebes' - the name by which it is remembered.\nThe city covered 36 square miles (93 square km) and is located approximately 419 miles (675km) south of modern Cairo. In the modern day, Luxor and Karnak occupy the site of ancient Thebes, and its surrounding area features some of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt such as the Valley of the Kings, the Valley of the Queens, the Ramesseum (temple of Ramesses II ), the temple of Ramesses III, and the grand temple complex of Queen Hatshepsut .\nThebes was prominent by c. 3200 BCE owing largely to the rise in popularity of the cult of the god Amun and was known for its wealth and grandeur. In the 8th century BCE, long after Thebes had seen better days, the Greek poet Homer would still write famously of the city in his Iliad , \"…in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots gleam, the hundred-gated Thebes\" and the Greeks would refer to the city as Diospolis Magna ('The Great City of the Gods').\nDuring the Amarna Period (1353-1336 BCE) Thebes was the world's largest city with a population at around 80,000 people. At this same time, Akhenaten moved the capital from Thebes to his custom-built city of Akhetaten to dramatically separate his reign from his predecessors; his son, Tutankhamun , returned the capital to Thebes once he took the throne. The powerful priests of Amun consolidated their power to the point where, during the 20th Dynasty (c. 1190-1069 BCE) they were able to reign as pharoahs from the city.\nThebes continued as an important cult center and place of pilgrimage throughout Egypt's history, even after the capital was moved to Per-Ramesses (near the older city of Avaris) by Ramesses II (1279-1213 BCE). During the Ramessid Period the priests of Amun ruled from Thebes while the pharaoh governed from Per-Ramesses. The city continued to grow in grandeur, especially the Temple of Amun, throughout this time. It was sacked by the Assyrians in 666 BCE, rebuilt, and finally destroyed by Rome in the 1st century CE.\nIn the time of the Old Kingdom (c. 2316-2181 BCE) the city was a minor trading post in Upper Egypt, which was controlled by local clans. During the First Intermediate Period (2181-2040 BCE) the kingship was centered in Memphis until the rulers moved the capital to Herakleopolis. They were just as ineffectual there, however, as they had been in the old capital and this encouraged the local magistrates at Thebes to rise against the central government. The city began to grow more powerful under the leadership of powerful governors such as Intef I (c. 2125 BCE), Mentuhotep I (c. 2115 BCE) and Wahankh Intef II (c. 2112-2063 BCE) who established themselves as royalty. Wahankh Intef II even declared himself the true king of Egypt in opposition to the kings at Herakleopolis.\nThe Theban rulers waged war with the kings of Herakleopolis for supremacy and to unite the land under one rule. Mentuhotep II (2061-2010 BCE), a Theban prince, finally prevailed in c. 2055 BCE defeating the Herakliopolitan kings and uniting Egypt under Theban rule. The victory of Mentuhotep II elevated his gods and, chief among them Amun, above those of Lower Egypt. This deity grew in stature from a local god of fertility to the supreme being and creator of the universe.\nThebes itself was thought to have been formed by the hands of Amun, drawn up from the Nile's waters, just as the primordial mound of the ben-ben rose from the swirling waters of chaos at the creation of the world. In the original creation story, the god Atum or Ra stands upon the ben-ben and begins the work of creation. Amun was a combination of Atum, the creator god, and Ra, the sun god and, as this supreme lord had stood on the first dry earth at the beginning of creation, Thebes was considered his sacred place on earth and, perhaps, the original ben-ben on which he stood at the beginning of time.\nThe veneration of Amun gave rise to the trinity known as the Theban Triad of Amun, Mut, and Khons (also known as Khonsu) who would be worshiped in the city for centuries. Amun represented the sun and the creative force; Mut was his wife symbolized as the sun's rays and the all-seeing eye; Khons was the moon, son of Amun and Mut, known as Khons the Merciful, destroyer of evil spirits, and god of healing. These three deities of Upper Egypt were drawn from the earlier gods Ptah, Sekhmet, and Khons of Lower Egypt who continued to be worshiped under their original names in Lower Egypt but whose attributes were transferred to the Amun, Mut, and Khons, deities of Thebes.\nThe popularity of these gods led directly to Thebes' development, wealth, and status. Construction of the Temple of Karnak, dedicated to the worship of the triad, was begun around this time (c. 2055 BCE), and the temple would continue to grow in size and grandeur over the next 2,000 years as more and more details were added. It remains the largest religious structure ever built in the world. The priests of Amun, who administered the rites of the temple, would eventually grow so powerful they would threaten the authority of the pharaoh and, by the Third Intermediate Period (1069-525 BCE) the priests of Amun would rule Upper Egypt from Thebes.\nThebes grew in status during the Second Intermediate Period (1640-1532 BCE) when the Theban princes stood against the mysterious Hyksos rulers of the Delta region. The Hyksos were a people of unknown origin and ethnicity (though many theories have claimed to be able to identify them) who either invaded Egypt or migrated into the region and steadily took power. They were firmly in control of Egypt by c. 1650 BCE and were regarded by later Egyptian historians as oppressive foreigners even though evidence suggests they introduced many innovations and improvements to the culture (the chariot among the more notable).\nThe Thebans and the Hyksos abided by a truce which forbade hostilities but did not guarantee any amicable relations between the two. The Hyksos would sail past Thebes to trade with the Nubians to the south and the Thebans would ignore them until the Hyksos ruler Apophis (also known as Apepi) insulted Ta'O of Thebes in 1560 BCE and the truce was broken. The Theban armies under Ta'O attacked the Hyksos cities . When Ta'O died in battle his son Kamose took command of the armies and razed their stronghold of Avaris. After his death , his brother Ahmose I took charge and captured the re-built city of Avaris, the Hyksos capital. Ahmose I drove the Hyksos out of Egypt and reclaimed the lands formerly ruled by them. Thebes was celebrated as the city which had liberated the country and was elevated to the position of capital of the country.\nWith Egypt stabilized again, religion and religious centers flourished and none more so than Thebes.\nWith Egypt stabilized again, religion and religious centers flourished and none more so than Thebes. The shrines, temples, public buildings and terraces of Thebes were unsurpassed for their beauty and splendor. It was written that all other cities were judged 'after the pattern of Thebes'. The power and beauty of the great god Amun needed to be reflected fully in the holy city of Thebes and every building project sought to out-do the last in proclaiming the glory of this god.\nThe Tuthmosids of the 18th Dynasty (1550-1307 BCE) lavished their wealth on Thebes and made the Egyptian capital the most glorious city in Egypt. Work continued on the Temple of Karnak, but other temples and monuments rose as well. Most of the greatest monuments of ancient Thebes were either constructed, renovated, or improved upon during this period from c. 1550-1069 BCE with a brief interruption during the Amarna Period.\nDuring the reign of Akhenaten (originally known as Amenhotep IV, 1353-1336 BCE) the priests of Amun at Thebes had become so powerful that they owned more land than the pharaoh and had more wealth than the crown. Scholars believe this situation may have prompted Amenhotep IV to adopt monotheism and proclaim the Aten - the sun disk - the supreme deity. In denying the existence of other gods, Akhenaten effectively cut off the source of the priests' wealth and power. The worship of all other gods except the Aten was outlawed, sacred icons and statuary destroyed, and the temples of Amun closed. Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten (meaning \"successful for Aten\"), and with his proclamation of the 'one true god, Aten', Thebes was abandoned for El-Amarna and the new city of Akhetaten.\nIf Akhenaten's true motive for religious reformation was to crush the priests of Amun and absorb their power, it worked; there was now only one true God whose will was interpreted by Akhenaten alone. While this new belief worked well for the pharaoh and the royal family, the people of Egypt were highly resentful. The worship of the many traditional gods of Egypt was an important aspect of everyday life throughout the country, and there were many, besides the priests, who lost their jobs once Akhenaten's monotheism became the religion of the land. Every merchant who sold religious artifacts and charms, every craftsman who made them, every scribe who wrote spells or prayers, was unemployed unless they turned their efforts to promoting the pharaoh's religion.\nAfter Akhenaten's death, his son Tutankhaten (\"living image of Aten\") took the throne and changed his name to Tutankhamun (\"living image of Amon\") and restored the old gods and their temples. The capital was returned to Thebes, and a renewed interest in building projects began, perhaps to make amends to the gods who had been neglected, which produced even more glorious temples and shrines. The western shore of Thebes became a vast and beautiful necropolis in the years and centuries following and the mortuary complexes at Deir-El Bahri (like the one of Queen Hatshepsut) were awe-inspiring in their symmetry and grandeur.\nTutankhamun was succeeded by his general Horemheb (1320-1292 BCE), who believed that the old gods of Egypt were angered by the heretic king's insult to their honor. He encouraged building projects at Thebes (and elsewhere) and destroyed any iconography related to the worship of Aten or the royal family of the Amarna Period. He named Ramesses I as his successor who founded the 19th Dynasty.\nRamesses II moved the capital from Thebes to a new site near the city of Avaris called Per-Ramesses where he built a grand palace to distinguish his reign from any which preceeded it. On a simpler level, he may have done this simply because there was nothing of significance he could add to the grandeur of Thebes and he was a pharaoh who needed to make an impression. Avaris now grew in prosperity and beauty as Thebes declined in power but this was a temporary situation. The priests of Amun, able to do as they pleased so far removed from the sphere of the pharaohs at Avaris, acquired significant amounts of land through which they amassed more and more wealth and greater power. By the time of the Ramessid Period they were ruling Thebes as pharaohs and the actual rulers at Avaris could do nothing about it.\nThe city declined during the Third Intermediate Period but still was impressive. The continued worship of the popular Amun and the legendary beauty of the city guaranteed Thebes a special place in the hearts of the Egyptians. The Nubian pharaoh Tatanami made Thebes his capital in the 7th century BCE, linking himself to the glory of the past, but his reign was short-lived. The Assyrian king Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt in 667 BCE and a second time in 666 BCE, completing the work he had left unfinished earlier, and sacked Thebes, driving Tatanami out of Egypt and leaving the city in ruins.\nThe Assyrians decreed that Thebes should be restored and rebuilt by Egyptian labor to compensate for their resistance to Assyrian rule. The city gradually recovered and worship of Amon continued there until the coming of Rome when it was destroyed by the Roman army in the 1st century CE. Afterwards it remained in ruins, populated only by a few people inhabiting the buildings which had been left vacant after the Romans moved on.\nBy the time of the historian Strabo (c. 63 BCE - 24 CE) the city was no more than a tourist attraction of ancient ruins and empty streets. Thebes retained its legendary status, however, and continued to be venerated by those who remembered its former glory. As the site of the Valley of the Kings, the Valley of the Queens, the great Temple of Karnak, and those of Luxor, Thebes continues as a vital link to ancient Egyptian culture and the vitality of its history into the present day."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

Efforts to set a cohesive national monetary policy through a central bank in the U.S. have been many and turbulent.\nHowever, pushing the Federal Reserve building into the Potomac River wouldn’t be easy. Let’s see how the process could play out.\nWhat has to be done?\nThe first thing to do in getting rid of the Fed is for Congress to repeal the 1913 law —and the subsequent amendments—that set up the current Federal Reserve.\nBorn out of the 1907 depression and following 80 years without a Fed-like institution, the law was created to implement currency reform designed to stop financial panics and to provide an emergency reserve of money for the economy.\nThe Fed’s mandate grew to include setting certain interest rates, controlling inflation, regulating banks, and “reaching full employment.”\nSo what are the chances of a repeal? Even with the vocal criticism of Fed bashers like not much, says professor John Allan James from the Lubin School of Business at Pace University, who is critical of some Fed policies.\n“It would take the two houses of Congress 10 to 20 years, in my opinion, to get the required votes to tear the system down or alter it in any major fashion,” James explains.\nIf the law is repealed?\nBut suppose the law were taken off the books? The Fed’s job—in simple terms—is to manage the nation’s money supply and achieve the sometimes-conflicting tasks of full employment, stable prices while fighting inflation or deflation.\nHow would the U.S. economy then function? Something has to take its place, right?\nGlobal markets would also need some sort of economic direction from the U.S. The Fed manages the dollar — and as the world’s leading currency, a void left by a Fed-less America could throw those markets into chaos with uncertainty about who’s managing U.S. interest rates and the American economy.\nWhat about the gold standard?\nHold on, say naysayers like Paul, we don’t need another system. We can return to the gold standard . The amount of money in the economy would then be entrusted to the supply of gold in the world and cut down on anyone’s ability to increase U.S. dollars pumped into the economy— a major criticism of the Fed’s policies since the 2008 recession.\nRon Paul\nGetty Images\nTying the U.S. dollar’s value to a fixed weight of gold has been done before—even with the Fed in place.\nIt was after decades of being on and off both gold and silver that America ended the gold standard in 1933, when President Franklin Roosevelt banned private ownership of the metal.\nThe tie to gold was completely broken in 1971 by President Richard Nixon.\nWhat’s left is called a system of ‘fiat money’ in which currencies are backed by the ‘good faith’ of their government rather than a metal like gold.\nReverting back to gold would do more harm than good, even in the Fed’s worst days, says David Abuaf, CFA and CIO of Hefty Wealth Partners.\n“The gold standard brought about some long-run price stability but it’s also led to short-run volatility,” Abuaf explains. “It acts as a limit on economic growth. The money supply would be based on the production of gold. The management of money is easier with a fiat currency.”\nAnd there may not be enough gold to go around to back up the dollar — it could be hostage to the whims of gold traders.\nCan the Treasury step in?\nIf there were no return to the gold standard—and no Fed—what about the Treasury Department ? It could be responsible for the amount of money being injected into the economy.\nBut that would create a political earthquake over who would be Treasury Secretary—as they are appointed by the President but must be approved by the Senate.\nThe Fed currently has legal independence from the White House and Congress—but must make frequent Congressional appearances—but if the decisions were made by the Treasury, that economic autonomy could easily disappear. The politicking over economic theories would be endless.\n“Whatever replaces the Fed must be independent,” says Abuaf. “If there isn’t independence, it would be catastrophic. There needs to be a division of the government that does what the Fed does and be completely free of political interference.”\nTotal Cost: $58,065Tuition: $43,840Room & Board: $13,980Fees: $245Claremont McKenna, located near downtown Los Angeles, accepted only 12.4 percent of its applicants for the class of 2016, a rate that admissions counselor Brandon Gonzalez said ensures that students here will be going to school only with other top students.â€?The class of 2016 will be one of the most talented groups of students we have ever seen,â€?

It’s grown in power and created more critics along the way—but recently allowed a limited look inside its decision making. Some analysts believe it could do more.\n“While it may be far from easy, if not impossible to rein in the Fed,” says James, “making it much more transparent in what it does would reduce the need for abolishing it and at least reduce the rumbling from critics.”\nWhat’s the answer?\nIf history is any guide , having some sort of central bank may have been better than none. Out of 100 years of Fed control, the country has had 22 recessional years, including one depression. The 100 years before the Fed saw 44 recessions and six depressions.\nWhat’s left is this: until someone thinks of a better idea than the gold standard or handing the economic keys to the Treasury Department, or just leaving a void, the Fed will probably have to stick around—flaws and all.\n“I think most of the rhetoric is political blather and adds to a degree of uncertainty around the world, hurting all aspects of growth,” says John Allan James. “It may make good media copy, but the chances of the Fed being dissolved are totally unrealistic.”\nRelated"], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

[3] [1] During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those nations. [4]\nBorlaug was often called \"the father of the Green Revolution\", [5] [6] and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation . [7] [8] [9] [10] According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation , the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook 's 1997 article \"Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity.\" The article states that the \"form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths.\" [11] He was awarded the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.\nLater in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food production in Asia and Africa. [12]\nBorlaug was the great-grandchild of Norwegian immigrants to the United States. Ole Olson Dybevig and Solveig Thomasdatter Rinde, of Feios , a small village in Vik kommune , Sogn og Fjordane , Norway, emigrated to Dane County , Wisconsin , in 1854. [ citation needed ] The family eventually moved to the small Norwegian-American community of Saude, near Cresco , Iowa . There they were members of Saude Lutheran Church, where Norman was both baptized and confirmed.\nBorlaug was born to Henry Oliver (1889–1971) and Clara (Vaala) Borlaug (1888–1972) on his grandparents' farm in Saude in 1914, the first of four children. His three sisters were Palma Lillian (Behrens; 1916–2004), Charlotte (Culbert; b. 1919-2012) and Helen (b. d. 1921). From age seven to nineteen, he worked on the 106-acre (43 ha) family farm west of Protivin , Iowa , fishing, hunting, and raising corn, oats, timothy-grass , cattle, pigs and chickens. He attended the one-teacher, one-room New Oregon #8 rural school in Howard County , through eighth grade.\nToday, the school building, built in 1865, is owned by the Norman Borlaug Heritage Foundation as part of \"Project Borlaug Legacy\". [13] Borlaug was a member of the football, baseball and wrestling teams at Cresco High School, where his wrestling coach, Dave Barthelma, continually encouraged him to \"give 105%\". [14]\nBorlaug attributed his decision to leave the farm and pursue further education to his grandfather's urgent encouragement to learn: Nels Olson Borlaug (1859–1935) once told him, \"you're wiser to fill your head now if you want to fill your belly later on.\" [15] When Borlaug applied for admission to the University of Minnesota in 1933, he failed its entrance exam, but was accepted at the school's newly created two-year General College. After two quarters, he transferred to the College of Agriculture's forestry program. As a member of University of Minnesota's varsity wrestling team, Borlaug reached the Big Ten semifinals, and promoted the sport to Minnesota high schools in exhibition matches all around the state.\nWrestling taught me some valuable lessons ... I always figured I could hold my own against the best in the world. It made me tough. Many times, I drew on that strength. It's an inappropriate crutch perhaps, but that's the way I'm made. [16]\nTo finance his studies, Borlaug put his education on hold periodically to earn some income, as he did in 1935 as a leader in the Civilian Conservation Corps , working with the unemployed on Federal projects. Many of the people who worked for him were starving. He later recalled, \"I saw how food changed them ... All of this left scars on me\". [17] From 1935 to 1938, before and after receiving his Bachelor of Science in forestry in 1937, Borlaug worked for the United States Forest Service at stations in Massachusetts and Idaho . He spent one summer in the middle fork of Idaho's Salmon River , the most isolated piece of wilderness in the nation at that time . [17]\nIn the last months of his undergraduate education, Borlaug attended a Sigma Xi lecture by Elvin Charles Stakman , a professor and soon-to-be head of the plant pathology group at the University of Minnesota. The event was a pivot for Borlaug's future. Stakman, in his speech entitled \"These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops\", discussed the manifestation of the plant disease rust , a parasitic fungus that feeds on phytonutrients in wheat, oats, and barley crops. He had discovered that special plant breeding methods produced plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug's job at the Forest Service was eliminated because of budget cuts, he asked Stakman if he should go into forest pathology . Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead. [16] He subsequently enrolled at the university to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug earned a Master of Science degree in 1940, and a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics in 1942.\nBorlaug was a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. While in college, he met his future wife, Margaret Gibson, as he waited tables at a coffee shop in the university's Dinkytown , where the two of them worked. They were married in 1937 and had three children, Norma Jean \"Jeanie\" Laube, Scotty (who died from spina bifida soon after birth), and William; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. On March 8, 2007, Margaret Borlaug died at the age of ninety-five, following a fall. [18] They had been married for sixty nine years. Borlaug resided in northern Dallas the last years of his life, although his global humanitarian efforts left him with only a few weeks of the year to spend there. [17]\nFrom 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington , Delaware . It was planned that he would lead research on industrial and agricultural bacteriocides , fungicides , and preservatives . However, following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor regulations; his lab was converted to conduct research for the United States armed forces . One of his first projects was to develop glue that could withstand the warm salt water of the South Pacific . The Imperial Japanese Navy had gained control of the island of Guadalcanal , and patrolled the sky and sea by day. The only way for U.S. forces to supply the troops stranded on the island was to approach at night by speedboat, and jettison boxes of canned food and other supplies into the surf to wash ashore. The problem was that the glue holding these containers together disintegrated in saltwater. Within weeks, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed an adhesive that resisted corrosion, allowing food and supplies to reach the stranded Marines. Other tasks included work with camouflage ; canteen disinfectants; DDT to control malaria; and insulation for small electronics. [17]\nIn 1940, the Avila Camacho administration took office in Mexico . The administration's primary goal for Mexican agriculture was augmenting the nation's industrialization and economic growth. U.S. Vice President-Elect Henry Wallace , who was instrumental in persuading the Rockefeller Foundation to work with the Mexican government in agricultural development, saw Avila Camacho's ambitions as beneficial to U.S. economic and military interests. [19] The Rockefeller Foundation contacted E.C. Stakman and two other leading agronomists. They developed a proposal for a new organization, the Office of Special Studies, as part of the Mexican Government, but directed by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was to be staffed with both Mexican and US scientists, focusing on soil development, maize and wheat production, and plant pathology .\nStakman chose Dr. Jacob George \"Dutch\" Harrar as project leader. Harrar immediately set out to hire Borlaug as head of the newly established Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in Mexico; Borlaug declined, choosing to finish his war service at DuPont. [20] In July 1944, after rejecting DuPont 's offer to double his salary, and temporarily leaving behind his pregnant wife and 14-month-old daughter, he flew to Mexico City to head the new program as a geneticist and plant pathologist . [17]\nIn 1964, he was made the director of the International Wheat Improvement Program at El Batán, Texcoco , on the eastern fringes of Mexico City , as part of the newly established Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research 's International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo, or CIMMYT). Funding for this autonomous international research training institute developed from the Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program was undertaken jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Mexican government .\nBesides his work in genetic resistance against crop loss, he felt that pesticides including DDT had more benefits than drawbacks for humanity and advocated publicly for their continued use. He continued to support pesticide use despite the severe public criticism he received for it. [21] [22] Borlaug mostly admired the work and personality of Rachel Carson but lamented her Silent Spring , what he saw as its inaccurate portrayal of the effects of DDT, and that it became her best known work. [23]\nBorlaug retired officially from the position in 1979, but remained a CIMMYT senior consultant . In addition to taking up charitable and educational roles, he continued to be involved in plant research at CIMMYT with wheat, triticale , barley , maize , and high-altitude sorghum .\nIn 1981, Borlaug became a founding member of the World Cultural Council . [24]\nIn 1984, Borlaug began teaching and conducting research at Texas A&M University . Eventually he was given the title Distinguished Professor of International Agriculture at the university and the holder of the Eugene Butler Endowed Chair in Agricultural Biotechnology .\nHe advocated for agricultural biotechnology as he had for pesticides in earlier decades: Publicly, knowledgeably, and always despite heavy criticism. [25] [22]\nBorlaug remained at A&M until his death in September 2009.\nThe Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, a joint venture by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture, involved research in genetics , plant breeding , plant pathology, entomology , agronomy , soil science , and cereal technology. The goal of the project was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which at the time was importing a large portion of its grain. Plant pathologist George Harrar recruited and assembled the wheat research team in late 1944. The four other members were soil scientist William Colwell; maize breeder Edward Wellhausen; potato breeder John Niederhauser ; and Norman Borlaug, all from the United States. [26] During the sixteen years Borlaug remained with the project, he bred a series of remarkably successful high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf wheat .\nBorlaug said that his first few years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained scientists and equipment. Local farmers were hostile towards the wheat program because of serious crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to stem rust . \"It often appeared to me that I had made a dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico,\" he wrote in the epilogue to his book, Norman Borlaug on World Hunger . [17] He spent the first ten years breeding wheat cultivars resistant to disease, including rust . In that time, his group made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat. [27]\nInitially, Borlaug's work had been concentrated in the central highlands, in the village of Chapingo near Texcoco , where the problems with rust and poor soil were most prevalent . The village never met their aims. He realized that he could speed up breeding by taking advantage of the country's two growing seasons. In the summer he would breed wheat in the central highlands as usual, then immediately take the seeds north to the Valle del Yaqui research station near Ciudad Obregón , Sonora . The difference in altitudes and temperatures would allow more crops to be grown each year. [ citation needed ]\nBorlaug's boss, George Harrar, was against this expansion. Besides the extra costs of doubling the work, Borlaug's plan went against a then-held principle of agronomy that has since been disproved. It was believed that to store energy for germination before being planted, seeds needed a rest period after harvesting. When Harrar vetoed his plan, Borlaug resigned. Elvin Stakman, who was visiting the project, calmed the situation, talking Borlaug into withdrawing his resignation and Harrar into allowing the double wheat season. As of 1945, wheat would then be bred at locations 700 miles (1000 km) apart, 10 degrees apart in latitude, and 8500 feet (2600 m) apart in altitude. This was called \"shuttle breeding\". [28]\nAs an unexpected benefit of the double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with photoperiodism . Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, \"As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we'd take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and there was lots of rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That wasn't supposed to happen by the books\". [27] This meant that the project would not need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet.\nBecause purebred ( genotypically identical) plant varieties often only have one or a few major genes for disease resistance , and plant diseases such as rust are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pure line's resistance, multiple linear lines varieties were developed. Multiline varieties are mixtures of several phenotypically similar pure lines which each have different genes for disease resistance. By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field. [ citation needed ]\nIn 1953, Borlaug extended this technique by suggesting that several pure lines with different resistance genes should be developed through backcross methods using one recurrent parent. [29] Backcrossing involves crossing a hybrid and subsequent generations with a recurrent parent. As a result, the genotype of the backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly similar to that of the recurrent parent. Borlaug's method would allow the various different disease-resistant genes from several donor parents to be transferred into a single recurrent parent. To make sure each line has different resistant genes, each donor parent is used in a separate backcross program. Between five and ten of these lines may then be mixed depending upon the races of pathogen present in the region. As this process is repeated, some lines will become susceptible to the pathogen . These lines can easily be replaced with new resistant lines.\nAs new sources of resistance become available, new lines are developed. In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease. Because the disease would spread more slowly than if the entire population were susceptible, this also reduces the damage to susceptible lines. There is still the possibility that a new race of pathogen will develop to which all lines are susceptible, however. [30]\nDwarfing is an important agronomic quality for wheat; dwarf plants produce thick stems. The cultivars Borlaug worked with had tall, thin stalks. Taller wheat grasses better compete for sunlight, but tend to collapse under the weight of the extra grain—a trait called lodging—from the rapid growth spurts induced by nitrogen fertilizer Borlaug used in the poor soil. To prevent this, he bred wheat to favor shorter, stronger stalks that could better support larger seed heads. In 1953, he acquired a Japanese dwarf variety of wheat called Norin 10 developed by the agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka in Iwate Prefecture , including ones which had been crossed with a high-yielding American cultivar called Brevor 14 by Orville Vogel . [31] Norin 10/Brevor 14 is semi-dwarf (one-half to two-thirds the height of standard varieties) and produces more stalks and thus more heads of grain per plant. Also, larger amounts of assimilate were partitioned into the actual grains, further increasing the yield. Borlaug crossbred the semi-dwarf Norin 10/Brevor 14 cultivar with his disease-resistant cultivars to produce wheat varieties that were adapted to tropical and sub-tropical climates. [32]\nBorlaug's new semi-dwarf, disease-resistant varieties, called Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62, changed the potential yield of spring wheat dramatically. By 1963, 95% of Mexico's wheat crops used the semi-dwarf varieties developed by Borlaug. That year, the harvest was six times larger than in 1944, the year Borlaug arrived in Mexico. Mexico had become fully self-sufficient in wheat production, and a net exporter of wheat. [33] Four other high-yield varieties were also released, in 1964: Lerma Rojo 64, Siete Cerros, Sonora 64, and Super X.\nIn 1961 to 1962, Borlaug's dwarf spring wheat strains were sent for multilocation testing in the International Wheat Rust Nursery, organized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture . In March 1962, a few of these strains were grown in the fields of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in Pusa, New Delhi, India. In May 1962, M. S. Swaminathan , a member of IARI's wheat program, requested of Dr B. P. Pal, director of IARI, to arrange for the visit of Borlaug to India and to obtain a wide range of dwarf wheat seed possessing the Norin 10 dwarfing genes. [ citation needed ] The letter was forwarded to the Indian Ministry of Agriculture headed by Shri C. Subramaniam , which arranged with the Rockefeller Foundation for Borlaug's visit.\nIn March 1963, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government sent Borlaug and Dr Robert Glenn Anderson to India to continue his work. He supplied 100 kg (220 lb) of seed from each of the four most promising strains and 630 promising selections in advanced generations to the IARI in October 1963, and test plots were subsequently planted at Delhi , Ludhiana , Pant Nagar , Kanpur , Pune and Indore . [ citation needed ] Anderson stayed as head of the Rockefeller Foundation Wheat Program in New Delhi until 1975.\nDuring the mid-1960s the Indian subcontinent was at war and experienced minor famine and starvation , which was limited partially by the U.S. shipping a fifth of its wheat production to India in 1966 & 1967. [26] The Indian and Pakistani bureaucracies and the region's cultural opposition to new agricultural techniques initially prevented Borlaug from fulfilling his desire to immediately plant the new wheat strains there. In 1965, as a response to food shortages, Borlaug imported 550 tons of seeds for the government. [17]\nBiologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote in his 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb , \"The battle to feed all of humanity is over ... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.\" Ehrlich said, \"I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971,\" and \"India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.\" [34]\nIn 1965, after extensive testing, Borlaug's team, under Anderson, began its effort by importing about 450 tons of Lerma Rojo and Sonora 64 semi-dwarf seed varieties: 250 tons went to Pakistan and 200 to India. They encountered many obstacles. Their first shipment of wheat was held up in Mexican customs and so it could not be shipped from the port at Guaymas in time for proper planting. [ citation needed ] Instead, it was sent via a 30-truck convoy from Mexico to the U.S. port in Los Angeles, encountering delays at the Mexico–United States border . Once the convoy entered the U.S., it had to take a detour, as the U.S. National Guard had closed the freeway due to the Watts riots in Los Angeles. When the seeds reached Los Angeles, a Mexican bank refused to honor Pakistan treasury's payment of US$ 100,000, because the check contained three misspelled words. Still, the seed was loaded onto a freighter destined for Bombay , India, and Karachi , Pakistan . Twelve hours into the freighter's voyage, war broke out between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region. Borlaug received a telegram from the Pakistani minister of agriculture, Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha : \"I'm sorry to hear you are having trouble with my check, but I've got troubles, too. Bombs are falling on my front lawn. Be patient, the money is in the bank ...\" [17]\nThese delays prevented Borlaug's group from conducting the germination tests needed to determine seed quality and proper seeding levels. They started planting immediately and often worked in sight of artillery flashes. A week later, Borlaug discovered that his seeds were germinating at less than half the normal rate. [ citation needed ] It later turned out that the seeds had been damaged in a Mexican warehouse by over-fumigation with a pesticide. He immediately ordered all locations to double their seeding rates. [35]\nThe initial yields of Borlaug's crops were higher than any ever harvested in South Asia . The countries subsequently committed to importing large quantities of both the Lerma Rojo 64 and Sonora 64 varieties. In 1966, India imported 18,000 tons—the largest purchase and import of any seed in the world at that time. In 1967, Pakistan imported 42,000 tons, and Turkey 21,000 tons. Pakistan's import, planted on 1.5 million acres (6,100 km 2 ), produced enough wheat to seed the entire nation's wheatland the following year. [26] By 1968, when Ehrlich's book was released, William Gaud of the United States Agency for International Development was calling Borlaug's work a \"Green Revolution\". High yields led to a shortage of various utilities—labor to harvest the crops, bullock carts to haul it to the threshing floor, jute bags, trucks, rail cars, and grain storage facilities. Some local governments were forced to close school buildings temporarily to use them for grain storage. [17]\nIn Pakistan, wheat yields nearly doubled, from 4.6 million tons in 1965 to 7.3 million tons in 1970; Pakistan was self-sufficient in wheat production by 1968. [ citation needed ] Yields were over 21 million tons by 2000. In India, yields increased from 12.3 million tons in 1965 to 20.1 million tons in 1970. By 1974, India was self-sufficient in the production of all cereals. By 2000, India was harvesting a record 76.4 million tons (2.81 billion bushels ) of wheat. Since the 1960s, food production in both nations has increased faster than the rate of population growth. [ citation needed ] India's use of high-yield farming has prevented an estimated 100 million acres (400,000 km 2 ) of virgin land from being converted into farmland—an area about the size of California , or 13.6% of the total area of India. [36] The use of these wheat varieties has also had a substantial effect on production in six Latin American countries, six countries in the Near and Middle East , and several others in Africa. [ citation needed ]\nBorlaug's work with wheat contributed to the development of high-yield semi-dwarf indica and japonica rice cultivars at the International Rice Research Institute and China's Hunan Rice Research Institute. Borlaug's colleagues at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research also developed and introduced a high-yield variety of rice throughout most of Asia. Land devoted to the semi-dwarf wheat and rice varieties in Asia expanded from 200 acres (0.8 km 2 ) in 1965 to over 40 million acres (160,000 km 2 ) in 1970. In 1970, this land accounted for over 10% of the more productive cereal land in Asia. [26]\nFor his contributions to the world food supply, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. Norwegian officials notified his wife in Mexico City at 4:00 am, but Borlaug had already left for the test fields in the Toluca valley, about 40 miles (65 km) west of Mexico City. A chauffeur took her to the fields to inform her husband. According to his daughter, Jeanie Laube, \"My mom said, 'You won the Nobel Peace Prize,' and he said, 'No, I haven't', ... It took some convincing ... He thought the whole thing was a hoax\". [17] He was awarded the prize on December 10.\nIn his Nobel Lecture the following day, he speculated on his award: \"When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution to the 'green revolution', they were in effect, I believe, selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of agriculture and food production in a world that is hungry, both for bread and for peace\". [37] His speech repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population . \"The green revolution has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.\n\"Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the \"Population Monster\"...Since man is potentially a rational being, however, I am confident that within the next two decades he will recognize the self-destructive course he steers along the road of irresponsible population growth...\" [38]\nBorlaug continually advocated increasing crop yields as a means to curb deforestation. The large role he played in both increasing crop yields and promoting this view has led to this methodology being called by agricultural economists the \"Borlaug hypothesis\", namely that increasing the productivity of agriculture on the best farmland can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new farmland . According to this view, assuming that global food demand is on the rise, restricting crop usage to traditional low-yield methods would also require at least one of the following: the world population to decrease, either voluntarily or as a result of mass starvations; or the conversion of forest land into crop land. It is thus argued that high-yield techniques are ultimately saving ecosystems from destruction. On a global scale, this view holds strictly true ceteris paribus , if deforestation only occurs to increase land for agriculture. But other land uses exist, such as urban areas, pasture, or fallow, so further research is necessary to ascertain what land has been converted for what purposes, to determine how true this view remains. [ according to whom? ]\nIncreased profits from high-yield production may also induce cropland expansion in any case, although as world food needs decrease, this expansion may decrease as well. [39]\nBorlaug expressed the idea now known as the \"Borlaug hypothesis\" in a speech given in Oslo, Norway, in 2000, upon the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize: \"Had the global cereal yields of 1950 still prevailed in 1999, we would have needed nearly 1.8 billion ha of additional land of the same quality – instead of the 600 million that was used – to equal the current global harvest\". [40]\nBorlaug's name is nearly synonymous with the Green Revolution , against which many criticisms have been mounted over the decades by environmentalists and some nutritionists [ who? ] . Throughout his years of research, Borlaug's programs often faced opposition by nonscientists who consider genetic crossbreeding to be unnatural or to have negative effects. [41] Borlaug's work has been criticized for bringing large-scale monoculture , input-intensive farming techniques to countries that had previously relied on subsistence farming to support smaller populations. [42] [ failed verification ] These farming techniques, in addition to increasing yields, often reaped large profits for U.S. agribusiness and agrochemical corporations and were criticized by one author in 2003 as widening social inequality in the countries owing to uneven food distribution while forcing a capitalist agenda of U.S. corporations onto countries that had undergone land reform . [43] [ improper synthesis? ]\nOther concerns of his critics and critics of biotechnology include the crossing of genetic barriers; the inability of a single crop to fulfill all nutritional requirements; the decreased biodiversity from planting a small number of varieties; the environmental and economic effects of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides; the side effects of large amounts of herbicides sprayed on fields of herbicide-resistant crops; and the destruction of wilderness caused by the construction of roads in populated third-world areas. [44]\nBorlaug refuted or dismissed most claims of his critics, but did take certain concerns seriously. He stated that his work has been \"a change in the right direction, but it has not transformed the world into a Utopia\". [45] Of environmental lobbyists opposing crop yield improvements, he stated, \"some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists . They've never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels . If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they'd be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things\". [46]\nFollowing his retirement, Borlaug continued to participate in teaching, research and activism. He spent much of the year based at CIMMYT in Mexico, conducting research, and four months of the year serving at Texas A&M University , where he had been a distinguished professor of international agriculture since 1984. From 1994 to 2003, Borlaug served on the International Fertilizer Development Center board of directors. In 1999, the university's Board of Regents named its US$16 million Center for Southern Crop Improvement in honor of Borlaug. He worked in the building's Heep Center, and taught one semester each year. [17]\nIn the early 1980s, environmental groups that were opposed to Borlaug's methods campaigned against his planned expansion of efforts into Africa. They prompted the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations and the World Bank to stop funding most of his African agriculture projects. Western European governments were persuaded to stop supplying fertilizer to Africa. According to David Seckler, former Director General of the International Water Management Institute , \"the environmental community in the 1980s went crazy pressuring the donor countries and the big foundations not to support ideas like inorganic fertilizers for Africa.\" [36]\nIn 1984, during the Ethiopian famine, Ryoichi Sasakawa , the chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation (now the Nippon Foundation ), contacted the semi-retired Borlaug, wondering why the methods used in Asia were not extended to Africa, and hoping Borlaug could help. He managed to convince Borlaug to help with this new effort, [47] and subsequently founded the Sasakawa Africa Association (SAA) to coordinate the project.\nThe SAA is a research and extension organization that aims to increase food production in African countries that are struggling with food shortages. \"I assumed we'd do a few years of research first,\" Borlaug later recalled, \"but after I saw the terrible circumstances there, I said, 'Let's just start growing'.\" [36] Soon, Borlaug and the SAA had projects in seven countries. Yields of maize in developed African countries tripled. Yields of wheat, sorghum , cassava , and cowpeas also increased in these countries. [36] At present (more than ten years after Borlaug's death in 2009), program activities are under way in Benin , Burkina Faso , Ethiopia , Ghana , Guinea , Mali , Malawi , Mozambique , Nigeria , Tanzania , and Uganda , all of which suffered from repeated famines in previous decades.\nFrom 1986 to 2009, Borlaug was the President of the SAA. That year, a joint venture between The Carter Center and SAA was launched called Sasakawa-Global 2000 (SG 2000). [48] The program focuses on food, population and agricultural policy. [49] Since then, more than 8 million small-scale farmers in 15 African countries have been trained in SAA farming techniques, which have helped them to double or triple grain production. [50] Those elements that allowed Borlaug's projects to succeed in India and Pakistan, such as well-organized market economies, transportation, and irrigation systems, are severely lacking throughout much of Africa, posing additional obstacles to increasing yields and reducing the ongoing threat of food shortages. Because of these challenges, Borlaug's initial projects were restricted to relatively developed regions of the continent.\nDespite these setbacks, Borlaug found encouragement. Visiting Ethiopia in 1994 after a major famine, Jimmy Carter won Prime Minister Meles Zenawi 's support for a campaign seeking to aid farmers, using the fertilizer diammonium phosphate and Borlaug's methods. The following season, Ethiopia recorded the largest harvests of major crops in history, with a 32% increase in production, and a 15% increase in average yield over the previous season. For Borlaug, the rapid increase in yields suggested that there was still hope for higher food production throughout sub-Saharan Africa, [36] despite lingering questions about population sustainability and the absence of long-term studies in Africa.\nThe World Food Prize is an international award recognizing the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world. The prize was created in 1986 by Norman Borlaug, as a way to recognize personal accomplishments, and as a means of education by using the Prize to establish role models for others. The first prize was given to Borlaug's former colleague, M. S. Swaminathan , in 1987, for his work in India. The next year, Swaminathan used the US$250,000 prize to start the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation for research on sustainable development .\nAt the DuPont Agriculture & Nutrition Media Day held in Des Moines , Iowa , on September 25, 2000, Borlaug announced the launch of Norman Borlaug University, an Internet-based learning company for agriculture and food industry personnel. The university was unable to expand the necessary content or customer base, and since late 2001 has been defunct.\nIn 2005, Borlaug, with his former graduate student Ronnie Coffman , convened an international expert panel in Kenya on the emerging threat of Ug99 in east Africa. [51] The working group produced a report, \" Sounding the Alarm on Global Stem Rust \", and their work led to the formation of the Global Rust Initiative. In 2008, with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , the organization was re-named the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative [52]\nThe limited potential for land expansion for cultivation worried Borlaug, who, in March 2005, stated that, \"we will have to double the world food supply by 2050.\" With 85% of future growth in food production having to come from lands already in use, he recommends a multidisciplinary research focus to further increase yields, mainly through increased crop immunity to large-scale diseases, such as the rust fungus, which affects all cereals but rice. His dream was to \"transfer rice immunity to cereals such as wheat, maize, sorghum and barley, and transfer bread-wheat proteins ( gliadin and glutenin ) to other cereals, especially rice and maize\". [53]\nBorlaug believed that genetically modified organisms (GMO) were the only way to increase food production as the world runs out of unused arable land . GMOs were not inherently dangerous \"because we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds.\" [54] In a review of Borlaug's 2000 publication entitled Ending world hunger: the promise of biotechnology and the threat of antiscience zealotry , [55] the authors argued that Borlaug's warnings were still true in 2010, [56]\nGM crops are as natural and safe as today's bread wheat, opined Dr. Borlaug, who also reminded agricultural scientists of their moral obligation to stand up to the antiscience crowd and warn policy makers that global food insecurity will not disappear without this new technology and ignoring this reality global food insecurity would make future solutions all the more difficult to achieve.— Rozwadowski and Kagale\nAccording to Borlaug, \"Africa, the former Soviet republics, and the cerrado are the last frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no additional sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless you are willing to level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before\". [36]\nBesides increasing the worldwide food supply, early in his career Borlaug stated that taking steps to decrease the rate of population growth will also be necessary to prevent food shortages. In his Nobel Lecture of 1970, Borlaug stated, \"Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the 'Population Monster' ... If it continues to increase at the estimated present rate of two percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock, about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population. The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively, unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this impending doom. The tick-tock of the clock will continually grow louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?\" [37] However, some observers have suggested that by the 1990s Borlaug had changed his position on population control. They point to a quote from the year 2000 in which he stated: \"I now say that the world has the technology—either available or well advanced in the research pipeline—to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called 'organic' methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot.\" [57] However, Borlaug remained on the advisory board of Population Media Center , an organization working to stabilize world population, until his death. [58]\nBorlaug died of lymphoma at the age of 95, on September 12, 2009, in his Dallas home. [2] [59] [3]\nBorlaug's children released a statement saying, \"We would like his life to be a model for making a difference in the lives of others and to bring about efforts to end human misery for all mankind.\" [60]\nThe Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh and President of India Pratibha Patil paid tribute to Borlaug saying, \"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress.\" [61]\nThe United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) described Borlaug as \"a towering scientist whose work rivals that of the 20th century's other great scientific benefactors of humankind\" [62] and Kofi Annan , former Secretary-General of the United Nations said, \"As we celebrate Dr. Borlaug's long and remarkable life, we also celebrate the long and productive lives that his achievements have made possible for so many millions of people around the world... we will continue to be inspired by his enduring devotion to the poor, needy and vulnerable of our world.\" [63]\nIn 1968, Borlaug received what he considered an especially satisfying tribute when the people of Ciudad Obregón , where some of his earliest experiments were undertaken, named a street after him. Also in that year, he became a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences .\nIn 1970, he was given an honorary doctorate by the Agricultural University of Norway . [64]\nIn 1970, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian Nobel Committee \"for his contributions to the 'green revolution' that was having such an impact on food production particularly in Asia and in Latin America.\" [64]\nIn 1971, he was named a Distinguished Fellow of the National Academy of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine of Argentina [65]\nIn 1971, he received the American Academy of Achievement 's Golden Plate Award. [66]\nIn 1974, he was awarded a Peace Medal (in the form of a dove, carrying a wheat ear in its beak) by Haryana Agricultural University , Hisar, India.\nIn 1975, he was named a Distinguished Fellow of the Iowa Academy of Science . [67]\nIn 1980, he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards . [68]\nIn 1980, he was elected honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences .\nIn 1984, his name was placed in the National Agricultural Hall of Fame at the national center in Bonner Springs , Kansas . Also that year, he was recognized for sustained service to humanity through outstanding contributions in plant breeding from the Governors Conference on Agriculture Innovations in Little Rock , Arkansas . Also in 1984, he received the Henry G. Bennet Distinguished Service Award at commencement ceremonies at Oklahoma State University . He recently received the Charles A. Black Award for his contributions to public policy and the public understanding of science .\nIn 1985, the University of Minnesota named a wing of the new science building in Borlaug's honor, calling it \"Borlaug Hall.\"\nIn 1986, Borlaug was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame during Norsk Høstfest . [69]\nIn 2012, a new elementary school in the Iowa City, IA school district opened, called \"Norman Borlaug Elementary\".\nOn August 19, 2013, his statue was unveiled inside the ICAR 's NASC Complex at New Delhi , India . [71]\nOn March 25, 2014, a statue of Borlaug at the United States Capitol was unveiled in a ceremony on the 100th anniversary of his birth. This statue replaces the statue of James Harlan as one of the two statues given to the National Statuary Hall Collection by the state of Iowa.\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, Borlaug received the 1977 U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom , the 2002 Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences, [72] the 2002 Rotary International Award for World Understanding and Peace, and the 2004 National Medal of Science . As of January 2004, Borlaug had received 49 honorary degrees from as many universities, in 18 countries, the most recent from Dartmouth College on June 12, 2005, [73] and was a foreign or honorary member of 22 international Academies of Sciences. [74] In Iowa and Minnesota, \" World Food Day \", October 16, is referred to as \"Norman Borlaug World Food Prize Day\". Throughout the United States, it is referred to as \" World Food Prize Day\".\nIn 2006, the Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award: the Padma Vibhushan . [75] He was awarded the Danforth Award for Plant Science by the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center , St Louis, Missouri in recognition of his lifelong commitment to increasing global agricultural production through plant science.\nSeveral research institutions and buildings have been named in his honor, including: the Norman E. Borlaug Center for Farmer Training and Education, Santa Cruz de la Sierra , Bolivia , in 1983; Borlaug Hall, on the St. Paul Campus of the University of Minnesota in 1985; Borlaug Building at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) headquarters in 1986; the Norman Borlaug Institute for Plant Science Research at De Montfort University , Leicester , United Kingdom in 1997; and the Norman E. Borlaug Center for Southern Crop Improvement, at Texas A&M University in 1999; and the Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA) in 2011. In 2006, the Texas A&M University System created the Norman Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture [ citation needed ] to be a premier institution for agricultural development and to continue the legacy of Dr. Borlaug.\nThe stained-glass World Peace Window at St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Minneapolis , Minnesota , depicts \"peace makers\" of the 20th century, including Norman Borlaug. [76] Borlaug was also prominently mentioned in an episode (\" In This White House \") of the TV show The West Wing . The president of a fictional African country describes the kind of \" miracle \" needed to save his country from the ravages of AIDS by referencing an American scientist who was able to save the world from hunger through the development of a new type of wheat. The U.S. president replies by providing Borlaug's name.\nBorlaug was also featured in an episode of Penn & Teller: Bullshit! , where he was referred to as the \"Greatest Human Being That Ever Lived\". In that episode, Penn & Teller play a card game where each card depicts a great person in history. Each player picks a few cards at random, and bets on whether one thinks one's card shows a greater person than the other players' cards based on a characterization such as humanitarianism or scientific achievement. Penn gets Norman Borlaug, and proceeds to bet all his chips, his house, his rings, his watch, and essentially everything he's ever owned. He wins because, as he says, \"Norman is the greatest human being, and you've probably never heard of him.\" In the episode—the topic of which was genetically altered food—he is credited with saving the lives of over a billion people. [77]\nIn August 2006, Dr. Leon Hesser published The Man Who Fed the World: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman Borlaug and His Battle to End World Hunger , an account of Borlaug's life and work. On August 4, the book received the 2006 Print of Peace award, as part of International Read For Peace Week. Borlaug is also the subject of the documentary film The Man Who Tried to Feed the World which first aired on American Experience on April 21, 2020. [78] [79]\nOn September 27, 2006, the United States Senate by unanimous consent passed the Congressional Tribute to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug Act of 2006. The act authorizes that Borlaug be awarded America's highest civilian award, the Congressional Gold Medal . On December 6, 2006, the House of Representatives passed the measure by voice vote. President George Bush signed the bill into law on December 14, 2006, and it became Public Law Number 109–395. [80] According to the act, \"the number of lives Dr. Borlaug has saved [is] more than a billion people\" The act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to strike and sell duplicates of the medal in bronze. [81] He was presented with the medal on July 17, 2007. [82]\nBorlaug was a foreign fellow of the Bangladesh Academy of Sciences . [83]\nThe Borlaug Dialogue (Norman E.

Learn everything about the analysis method and its importance to the Six Sigma methodology.\nRoot cause analysis (RCA) is a process for identifying the root causes of problems and a systematic approach for responding to them. Root cause analysis is based on the idea that effective management should find a way to prevent problems before they occur and affect the work of an entire organization.\nRoot cause analysis is one of the most crucial problem-solving elements in quality management. Root cause analysis is an important part of Six Sigma methodology, as it is a key component of the analyze phase of DMAIC – define, measure, analyze, improve, control.\nThere are six major tools of root cause analysis, which are used through the process of identifying the root causes of a problem.\n- Pareto Chart\n- The 5 Whys\n- Scatter Plot Diagram\n- Fishbone Diagram\n- Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)\n- Fault Tree Analysis\nA Pareto chart is a bar chart sorted in descending order from the highest frequency to the lowest frequency from left to right. The height of the bars reflects the frequency or the impact of the problems. The Pareto chart assists the quality improvement team in focusing on areas of improvement with the greatest impact. The Pareto chart is used in Six Sigma to find out the problems and their solutions, and root cause analysis is an important part of that process. To create a Pareto Chart , you can follow X, Y, and Z steps.\nThe 5 Whys method uses a series of questions to understand the layers of a problem. The idea is that each time you ask why, the answer you give becomes the fundamental of the next why until you find the sources of the problem. The 5 Whys is a simple tool used for problems where you don’t need any advanced data. This method is used to deeply analyze the results of a Pareto chart used in Six Sigma.\nA scatter diagram is a two-dimensional graphical representation of a set of data. The scatter diagram graphs pairs numerical data with one variable on each axis to look for their relationship. Its ability to show nonlinear relationships between variables is widely used in Six Sigma. Scatter plots are widely used as a tool for analyzing problems in Six Sigma. Scatter plots show how the variables relate to each other. This relationship is called correlation, and there are three types of correlation: positive, negative, and no correlation. In Six Sigma, a scatter plot will visually display the correlation between a problem and a cause, whether there is positive, negative, or no correlation. This helps quality teams to evaluate which hypothetical cause has the greatest impact on a problem and which should be solved first.\nA fishbone diagram , also called a cause-and-effect or Ishikawa diagram, sorts possible causes into various categories that origin from the initial problem. Moreover, a fishbone diagram may have additional multiple sub-causes derived from each identified category. The fishbone diagram is the most used cause-and-effect analysis tool in Six Sigma. The cause-and-effect analysis is one of the key tasks in any Six Sigma project.\nFailure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a method used to explore potential defects or failures during the process and product design. In Six Sigma, FMEA gives project teams a tool to predict the most likely failures that may impact the customers. The Failure Mode and Effects Analysis is implemented during the analyze phase of the Six Sigma DMAIC cycle, and it helps to estimate the significance of the impact of possible process failures.\nFault tree analysis (FTA) is a graphical tool and one of the more useful tools in Lean Six Sigma problem investigations. FTA explores the causes of system-level failures. Fault tree analysis prioritizes the risks in a way that allows the highest risks to be resolved first. It uses boolean logic to combine a series of lower-level events, and it is basically a top-down approach to identify the component level failures (basic event) that cause the system level failure (top event) to occur. When combined with other Lean Six Sigma tools , fault tree analysis helps the team focus on the most important input variables to the key output variables in a given process. FTA is a top-down approach to identify the component-level failures that cause the system-level failure to occur.\nHere you can see the ways to use the tools in Root Cause Analysis .\n- The Fishbone diagram’s purpose is to identify the many possible causes for a problem and to sort ideas into useful categories. The fishbone diagram should be implemented when the root cause is entirely unknown.\n- The Pareto chart’s purpose is to show which factors are more significant for a problem.\n- The Scatter diagram’s purpose is to help you look for a relationship between two variables. It is a method of testing correlation between the two variables. To implement this root cause analysis tool, you must plot the suspected cause on the x-axis while the effect is plotted on the y-axis.\n- The 5 Whys purpose is to drill down on a particular problem by asking “Why?” until you identify the core problem. The 5 Whys is best used when implemented with a Pareto Analysis.\n- Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) aims to identify different modes in which systems can fail and analyze the consequences and effects of each failure mode. The Failure Mode and Effects Analysis can be implemented during any phase of a particular system - the planning, designing, implementation, or inspection phase, and it helps to estimate the significance of the impact of possible process failures.\n- Fault tree analysis (FTA) purpose is to explore the causes of system-level failures in a top-down approach. You can implement a Fault Tree Analysis in five steps - identify the hazard, obtain an understanding of the system, create the fault tree, identify the cut sets, and lastly, mitigate the risk.\nRoot cause analysis can be performed in six steps - define the event, find causes, find the root cause, find solutions, take action, verify solution effectiveness. Some of the RCA tools can be implemented during the root cause analysis steps . To define the event and go to the source of the problem, you can use the 5 Whys. To find the potential causes of the event in question, you may implement Fishbone diagrams. To uncover the root cause that lies at the heart of the problem, you can use a Scatter Chart and Pareto Analysis.\nYes, there are root cause analysis tools templates. RCA templates are used to analyze a recurring problem and help eliminate the root causes. Root cause analysis teams drill down to the root of the problem in order to implement solutions so the problem won’t appear again.\n- The 5 Whys template can help ensure that business teams resolve the root cause of problems to avoid them from recurring. This 5 whys template has been designed to make it easier for you to ask and answer the question, “Why?”.\n- The Fishbone Diagram template can be used to explore the potential causes of a particular issue, enabling your team to find a solution more effectively. A Fishbone Diagram template is particularly useful when relying on experience and ideas rather than quantitative data.\n- The Pareto chart template is used to identify and list the problems and their causes. Then, you can score each problem individually and group them together by their cause. This is a clear, visual way to compare various factors contributing to any given problem.\n- A Scatter diagram template can be used to help you find the relationship between respective factors and influences. A scatter diagram charts numerical data pairs with a variable on each axis.\nRoot cause analysis tools are important in determining and identifying defects and the main causes of defects. By identifying the root cause, the organization can find a permanent solution to it so that possibility of its future re-occurrence can be reduced or eliminated. RCA plays an important role in developing a logical approach to solving problems.\nThe tools of root cause analysis are improving work efficiency by detecting and eliminating possible or existing problems at the beginning of a process, system, or production.\nRoot cause analysis tools have countless applications in many industries. Here you can see the list of Root Cause Analysis Sectors.\n- Engineering, automotive manufacturing, and industrial process control prevent environmental releases and be utilized for failure analysis in engineering and maintenance.\n- IT and data security, where root cause analysis helps individuals investigate security breaches.\n- Healthcare, where root cause analysis tools are used in environmental science, the medical device industry, occupational safety, and health.\n- Environmental industries, where RCA tools are used to make accident analyses in the aviation and rail industry and prevent their reocurrence.\n- The food and beverage industry to prevent food safety problems and regulatory action by identifying the causes.\nIn Summary\nThe main six approaches to root causes analysis are:\n- Pareto Charts\n- 5 Whys Analysis\n- Scatter Plot Diagrams\n- Fishbone Diagrams\n- Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)\n- Fault Tree Analysis"], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

Here's a list of his best performances against every team in the Association.\nESPN\nBy Max Golkin , PSO Asst. Director of Basketball Personnel\nMay 23, 2020\nMay 23, 2020\nInspired by ESPN’s 30 for 30 documentary series “The Last Dance”, now is the perfect time to compile a list of Jordan’s best games against every team in the NBA. Michael Jordan is widely considered the greatest player of all-time . He’s had more success than any player during his generation and thrived vs. every single team in the league. Let’s take a look at his most outstanding performances against every NBA team.\nApril 16th, 1987 – Regular Season Game\nThe ’86-’87 season was MJ’s breakout year, averaging a career-best 37.1 points per game (which hasn’t been matched since). He was forced to carry a talent-limited Bulls team to a 40-42 record and the eighth seed in the East that season. Jordan exploded in this game against Atlanta, scoring 61 points (tying his regular season career-high at that point) on 22-38 shooting, adding 10 rebounds, and four steals. The Hawks still found a way to win the game. Atlanta outscored the Bulls 37-23 in the final period to grab the win, their 57th of the season. Hall of Famer Dominque Wilkins went for 34 points.\nApril 20th, 1986 – Eastern Conference First Round Game 3\nIn his second season, Jordan missed the majority of the year with a broken foot. He was able to get back on the court in time for the Playoffs, with his Bulls meeting up with the top-seeded Boston Celtics led by Larry Bird in the first round. Chicago was no match for the Celtics, who would eventually win the title, but that didn’t stop Jordan from putting on a show.\nAfter a 49-point performance in Game 1, he followed that up in Game 2 in Boston with a Playoff career-high 63 points as they went to double-overtime . Unfortunately, Chicago lost the game, 135-131, but Jordan’s performance still stands as the most points scored by ANY player in NBA Postseason history. However, Chicago would get swept in three straight games.\nFebruary 26th, 1987 – Regular Season Game\nBefore the Nets were in Brooklyn, they called New Jersey home where Michael Jordan had one of the greatest plays of his career . Jordan’s greatest game against the Nets came during a 128-113 victory with MJ exploding for 58 points that included a near perfect 26-for-27 effort from the free throw line. The GOAT didn’t have much help from his supporting cast that night as Chicago’s next leading scoring John Paxson only added 16 points.\nDecember 29th, 2001- Regular Season Game\nAfter establishing himself as the unquestioned best player in the game, Michael Jordan took a three-year hiatus before taking his talents to Washington D.C. to play for the Wizards. While still maintaining a scoring average over 20 PPG in DC, he was essentially a shell of his former MVP self. However, he managed to score over 45 points once during his time in the nation’s capital and it was against the only other organization he would end up aligning with besides the Wizards and the Bulls.\nJanuary 19th, 2002- Regular Season Game\nJordan made his highly-anticipated return to the United Center in Wizards blue and white. It was his first time in the visiting locker room. When the starting lineups were announced, Jordan received a three-minute long ovation as Chicago remembered the iconic moments he provided. Though Jordan would only score 16 points in his return to the Windy City, this game deserves a spot on this list due to its significance.\nIn Jordan’s interview after the game, he stated, “when the crowd started that whole thing, it made it tough for me to play,” Jordan admitted. “I had a tough time playing against Chicago. It’s like playing a relative, in a sense. It’s not as intense, you’re not quite as motivated.” Jordan’s 16.2 PPG against the Bulls over six games is by far the lowest average against any team he’s ever faced.\nMarch 28th, 1990 – Regular Season Game\nOne could understandably choose “The Shot” as MJ’s best game, but putting up almost 70 points in a game deserves recognition too. Considering Michael Jordan scored a career-best 69 points in the Bulls 117-113 overtime win against the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1990, it deserved to represent this spot on the list. Jordan shot a ludicrous 23-for-37 from the field and was 21-for-23 from the free-throw line as he put together an incredibly efficient scoring attack all game.\nApril 7th, 1990 – Regular Season Game\nAlthough the Mavericks were never a rival of the Bulls, that didn’t stop Michael from torching them for 43 points during their regular season matchup in 1990. MJ put up 43 points in 40 minutes on 15-26 shooting from the field and going 3-for-5 from three-point land. In 25 games against the Mavs, MJ averaged 27.4 PPG, 6.8 RPG, & 5.5 APG.\nFebruary 4th, 1996 – Regular Season Game\nWith Chicago’s record-breaking season on the line every night, the Bulls were down by 31 points late in the second quarter. However, when Michael Jordan is on the opposing team, no lead is safe. He scored 23 points in the third quarter alone as he brought the Bulls back and eventually took the lead. Unfortunately, they would end up losing 1 of their 10 games that season 105-98, but Jordan’s second-half dominance was one for the books.\nMay 27th, 1989 – NBA Eastern Conference Finals Game 3\nWith the 1989 ECF series tied one-a-piece, the Bulls had home-court advantage for Game 3. Jordan dropped 46 points on 16-for-26 shooting and went 14-for-15 from the free throw line. Jordan added seven rebounds, dished five assists, and stole the ball five times in the Bulls’ 99-97 victory. Despite MJ’s heroics to take a 2-1 lead in the series, however, the Bulls would lose the next three games and the series.\nNovember 24th, 1992 – Regular Season Game\nThe most points Michael Jordan scored in a game against the Warriors was when he dropped 49 points in 1992 at Golden State. Jordan shot 18-of-30 from the field, including 1-of-3 from three-point range, and 12-of-14 from the free throw line. He also recorded five rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one block in 44 minutes in the 101-92 Bulls victory. 20 years later, the Warriors were beginning to build the only dynasty that was able to win more games in a season than Jordan’s Bulls.\nJanuary 3rd, 1996 – Regular Season Game\nThis matchup featured the number one overall pick of the 1984 draft and the 3rd overall pick: Hakeem “the Dream” Olajuwon vs. Michael “Air” Jordan. The Finals matchup fans never got to see. The 2x reigning champ Houston Rockets facing off against the previous 3x reigning champ Chicago Bulls before Jordan retired in 1993.\nMJ let it be known in this game that the Rockets have some competition if they want to 3-peat as he almost finished with 40 points in a near-blowout against Houston. The Rockets failed to beat the Sonics in the West Playoffs so they couldn’t even defend their title against the Bulls later that year.\nApril 13th, 1989 – Regular Season Game\nThe Chicago Bulls were taking on the Indiana Pacers late in the 1988-89 season, with Chicago vying for playoff positioning and the Pacers just playing out the rest of their schedule. As a temporary Point Guard, Jordan posted a monster triple-double, scoring 47 points with 13 assists and 11 rebounds but the Bulls still lost by 4.\nNovember 21st, 1997 – Regular Season Game\nAs he was getting into his mid-30’s, Michael Jordan continued to play phenomenal during the 1997-98 regular season as he won his fifth MVP . On this November night, he scored 49 points against the Clippers in Los Angeles. MJ played a total of 52 minutes in the game, helping the Bulls secure the double-overtime win with Scottie Pippen out of action.\nJune 5th, 1991 – NBA Finals Game 2\nIn the NBA Finals, MJ displayed all the tools that made him one of the most complete basketball players on the planet – while sharing the court with Magic Johnson. After struggling in Game 1, Air Jordan responded with 33 points on an incredible 83.3 FG% to go along with 13 assists, 7 rebounds, 1 block, and 2 steals. The Bulls rode the momentum of this game to win the next three games, as Michael Jordan celebrated the first Championship of his career a week later.\nNov. 30th, 1995 – Regular Season Game\nMichael Jordan’s highest-scoring game against the Grizzlies came in Vancouver on Nov. 30, 1995. He scored 29 points on 14-for-26 shooting from the field and 1-for-2 from the free-throw line. Jordan saved his best for last, leading the Bulls to a comeback win by scoring 19 points in the game’s final six minutes. Besides facing Chicago, the two franchises Jordan struggled most against throughout his career were Vancouver (22.7 PPG) and Toronto (20.5 PPG), the NBA’s only Canadian teams.\nApril 29th, 1992 – Eastern Conference First Round Game 3\nThe Bulls were leading the Heat 2-0 in the series of the 1992 Playoffs 1st Round and looking to close things out in Miami. Heading into the fourth quarter, Chicago trailed 80-79. Not only did Jordan have an amazing performance, but he and Pippen were fantastic as a duo. The two players combined to score 87 points with 56 coming from Jordan as they won the game 119-114 and eliminated the Heat from the postseason.\nFebruary 16th, 1989 – Regular Season Game\nWith the Bucks leading the Bulls by 12 points heading into the fourth quarter, Michael Jordan displayed the brilliance everyone knew he was capable of. Jordan hit the GOAT-mode switch and dropped 27 points in that final period to rack up 50 overall, to go along with eight rebounds, five assists, and three steals, and it’s even more impressive considering how he did it. Despite trailing for the entire second half, the game-winner came from Michael Jordan’s hands as he knocked down a mid-range jumper with one second left on the clock.\nApril 3rd, 1998 – Regular Season Game\nAs people could see from the documentary, Michael Jordan was on a mission during his “Last Dance” season. The Bulls matchup with the Timberwolves was a great example of Jordan showing his masterful offensive game. MJ dropped 41 points on 16-25 shooting from the field as the Bulls beat the Timberwolves 107-93. ‘Air Jordan’ can be seen getting buckets from all over the court in the highlights of his excellent performance.\nMarch 28th, 1995 – Regular Season Game\nMichael Jordan made it clear multiple times throughout his career that he shines brightest on the biggest stage. There is no bigger stage in the NBA than Madison Square Garden in the most populated city in the country. Jordan had many significant performances against the Knicks, but his most memorable game came just five games after he announced “I’m Back” in 1995. With a star-studded group in attendance, MJ put on a show, dropping 55 points, and came away with the game-winning assist as the Bulls won 113-111.\nMay 27th, 1996 – Eastern Conference Finals Game 6\nThe Bulls went into Game 4 in Orlando with a 3-0 series lead, needing just one win to sweep the Magic out of the playoffs. While Shaquille O’Neal and Penny Hardaway each had good games with 28 points a piece, Michael Jordan was on another level. He dropped 45 points on 16-for-23 shooting from the field, giving the Bulls a 106-101 victory and closing out the series, officially avenging their only postseason series loss after 1991.\nJanuary 13th, 1996 – Regular Season Game\nEntering this game, Chicago was 29-3 while the 76ers were a dreadful 7-25, so it was pretty clear who was likely to win. The real question was by how much, and how much would MJ score in the victory? The answer: Jordan posted 48 points on 18-28 shooting, and was perfect from line (7-7). The Bulls dominated the Sixers all evening, ending it with a 120-93 victory.\nJune 6th, 1993 – NBA Finals Game 4\nAfter winning the first two games of the 1993 NBA Finals against the Phoenix Suns, Chicago lost Game 3 in Phoenix and tried to avoid allowing the Suns to tie the series in Game 4. Knowing the importance of the situation, MJ went off for 55 points on 21-for-37 shooting while adding eight rebounds and four assists. The Bulls completed a 111-105 win, taking a commanding 3-1 series lead that they would finish in six games.\nJune 3rd, 1992 – NBA Finals Game 1 (The Shrug Game)\nWith the media comparing Clyde Drexler to the great Michael Jordan , the GOAT took that disrespect to the court by coming out firing in Game 1. The United Center was buzzing after his third 3-pointer and nearly exploded after his fourth. Then came the fifth, all in the first half. Jordan was truly letting it fly from deep. After hitting his SIXTH three-pointer of the game, Jordan couldn’t help but shrug toward Magic Johnson who was commentating the game, and it became iconic.\nHis six three-pointers were a Finals record for a single half, as was his 35 points. He would finish with 39 on the night as he rested for a large part of the second half of a 33-point victory. Jordan’s Bulls would go on to win the series in six games, establishing him as a back-to-back NBA Champion for the first time.\nNovember 23rd, 1997 – Regular Season Game\nIn 1997, Jordan scored 33 points against the Kings in a game that Chicago beat Sacramento by a final score of 126-108. Jordan shot 11-19 from the field and went 11-12 from the line. This was about a month into their “Last Dance” season before they really kicked it into gear en route to winning a third straight NBA championship to end his career.\nNovember 13th, 1984 – Regular Season Game\nIn Michael Jordan’s rookie season, he immediately showed the league what he was truly capable of. The Bulls were 6-2 going into a home game against the Spurs and ‘Air Jordan’ put on the best performance of his young career thus far by dropping his first of many 40-point games. The Bulls snuck out of Chicago with a 120-117 win and the clear realization that they have a superstar on their squad.\nJune 16th, 1996 – NBA Finals Game 6\nBefore moving to Oklahoma City, the Thunder franchise was based in Seattle as the Supersonics or simply referred to as the “Sonics.” Gary Payton’s squad had quite a few run-ins with Jordan and his Bulls. Michael Jordan would win his first title since returning from baseball during their historic 1995-96 season as he finished it off with 22 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists on Father’s Day as the Chicago Bulls won their fourth Championship in franchise history (all with Jordan).\nNovember 7th, 1995 – Regular Season Game\nAs noted above in the Grizzlies section, Jordan didn’t always play his best when facing Canadian teams. However, he did manage to drop 38 points on two separate occasions against the Raptors. His best all-around performance came early in the 1995-96 season when he led the Bulls to a nine-point victory with an efficient shooting performance (13-for-19 FG) to go alongside a well-balanced five assists, four rebounds, and four steals.\nJune 14th, 1998 – NBA Finals Game 6\nMichael Jordan’s best game against the Jazz can also be considered his greatest game ever. It may not be the game where he posted the greatest numbers, but the way this one went down will forever be legendary. In Jordan’s last game as a Bull, he was required to shoot an extraordinary 35 shots thanks to an injured Scottie Pippen.\nMJ finished his Bulls career with 45 points and put the finishing touches on the greatest sequence to end a Finals game in NBA history. With the Jazz owning a three-point lead with about 30 seconds left before forcing a Game 7, Jordan scored a quick layup, stole the ball, and capped it off with the the game-winning jumper to earn his sixth and final Championship, reaching unanimous GOAT status."], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

After their victory, the Cowboys lost in the Divisional Round to the Los Angeles Rams 30-22.\nThe Cowboys hadn’t won a road playoff game since the 1992 season when they defeated the 49ers 30-20.\nRelated:\nDallas last made it to the Super Bowl back in the 1995-1996 season.\nThe Cowboys clinched their spot in Super Bowl 30 after defeating the Philadelphia Eagles in the Divisional Round and the Green Bay Packers in the NFC title game. They then faced the Pittsburgh Steelers and ended up winning the game 27-17.\nLet’s look back even further to The Cowboys’ first-ever Super Bowl appearance. Dallas joined the NFL in 1960 as an expansion team under head coach Tom Landry. They were off to a rough start as they had losing seasons through the first five years. But once they started gaining some traction, they were unstoppable.\nSuper Bowl V: 1971, vs Baltimore Colts (loss) 11 years after joining the NFL, in 1971, the Cowboys made their first Super Bowl appearance against the Baltimore (now Indianapolis) Colts. The Cowboys lost with a score of 16-13 with the last Colts field goal winning it with five seconds left in the game. Strangely enough, though the Cowboys lost, it was a member of their team, Chuck Howley, who won the Most Valuable Player Award. He, a linebacker, was also the first player to win the award who wasn’t a quarterback.\nSuper Bowl VI: 1972, vs Miami Dolphins (win) One year later, in 1972, the Cowboys saw their first Super Bowl victory. They played the Miami Dolphins and held them to 185 yards and not a single touchdown in an epic 24-3 defeat. Meanwhile, the Cowboys had a record of 252 rushing yards. This was the era of Roger Staubach , Chuck Howley , and Duane Thomas .\nSuper Bowl X: 1976, vs Pittsburgh Steelers (loss) The Cowboys lost this one 21-17 to the Steelers, who were the first team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls. The Steelers were losing by 3 in the final quarter but rallied to score 14 more points with Dallas scoring only one more touchdown late in the game.\nSuper Bowl XII: 1978, vs Denver Broncos (win) This particular Super Bowl was the most-watched of all Cowboys Super Bowls with over 100 million fans watching both at home and in front of a sold-out stadium. Perhaps this was due to it being the first Super Bowl to ever be played in prime time in the Eastern US, or perhaps it was just because Staubach and company were so fun to watch. It was a defense-dominant Cowboys team that forced eight turnovers and allowed only eight pass completions and 61 yards to the Broncos that helped the Cowboys to the 27-10 victory over the Denver Broncos.\nSuper Bowl XIII: 1979, vs Pittsburgh Steelers (loss) This was an exciting Super Bowl for a few reasons. The Cowboys had an opportunity for a rematch after losing to the Steelers three years earlier, and both teams were looking to be the first to win a third Super Bowl. It was also the only Super Bowl that featured both teams which had won two Super Bowls in that same decade. In the end, the Cowboys lost in a close game, 35-31. There were 11 players on that Cowboys team who ended up in the Hall of Fame.\nSuper Bowl XXVII: 1993, vs Buffalo Bills (win) Here is where we get to the huge win-streak. The 90s were a big time for the Dallas Cowboys. This game in particular was the biggest win the Cowboys ever had, with a 52-17 defeat over the Bills. We saw four touchdown passes from Troy Aikman and 108 rushing yards by Emmitt Smith and this Cowboys team just made it look like a walk in the park.\nSuper Bowl XXVVIII: 1994, vs Buffalo Bills (win) The Cowboys and Bills rematch just one year later ended with a second consecutive Super Bowl victory for the Boys, 30-13 over the Bills. Again, the Cowboys just waltzed in and danced around the Bills, with Emmitt Smith rushing for 132 yards and two touchdowns.\nSuper Bowl XXX: 1996, vs Pittsburgh Steelers (win) Things were heating up for the Cowboys in this decade. They took an early lead over the Steelers with Troy Aikman , J ay Novacek , and Chris Boniol helping to gain an early 13 to zip lead. Hall of Famers Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin could not be stopped and in the end, the Cowboys finally got their victory revenge over the Steelers, 27 to 17.\nWho knew that would be the last time we’d see a Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl for over two decades? Yet, fans still believe they will get there again, and soon.\nAmerica’s Team is looking more like Super Bowl contenders than they have in a while. Good enough for a Super Bowl run?

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The earliest recorded use of the term is from Scotland in 1808.", "reference_documents": ["Most body parts come alone or in pairs. We have one nose, one tongue, and one navel. We sport two eyes, two knees, two feet, and so on. Fingers are a glaring exception—we’ve got a party of five on each side. This presents difficulties. When we want to single one out from the group—to specify which finger we slammed in the door, for instance—what do we do? We name them, naturally. But how?\nThis is a uniquely human problem. Pentadactyly —the condition of having five fingers—is pervasive in the biological world, but we are the only species that has the capacity (or occasion) to talk about those fingers. The problem is not just that we have five of them, but that they are so vexingly similar: they differ slightly in size and dexterity, but all have that pucker-knuckled, nail-capped look. How have people in different times and places solved this problem? How have they named the members of this confusable quintet? Answering this question offers a tour of the inventiveness of the human mind.\nConsider first the thumb . Appearance is an especially common source of thumb names. The modern English word, for example, comes from an older word meaning “stout” or “thick.” Other languages highlight the fact that the thumb is powerful, despite its short stature. The Latin term for this member— pollex , still used in medical contexts —comes from a verb meaning “to be strong.” In Kurdish, these associations of compactness and strength come together in the label “ram finger.”\nGet your fix of JSTOR Daily’s best stories in your inbox each Thursday.\nPrivacy Policy Contact Us\nYou may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message.\nThe case of “ram finger” hints at a broader pattern: we often see our fingers as animate beings, little agents with their own personalities. We thus often name them after animals or after human social roles. In some Native American languages , the thumb is called the “chief finger.” Elsewhere it is cast as a family member : the terms “mother,” “father,” “older brother,” or “grandfather finger” are all attested. Although scarce in Europe, labels that compare fingers to humans are common worldwide. One study found such names in a fifth of the 123 languages surveyed.\nThe thumb has attracted an array of other names. In Greek, it is known as “what is opposite the fingers.” In several Turkic languages , it is known as the “head finger.” In some parts of the Middle East and Mediterranean, the name for the thumb stems from an unsavory function that, thankfully, it no longer has to serve (much): the lice killer.\nUp next: the index finger . This label comes from the finger’s use in pointing: the English word index is rooted in an earlier word meaning “to show.” Names that associate this finger with pointing can be found around the globe, but others come into play as well. English speakers also call it the forefinger because of its position as the first of the fingers proper, excluding the thumb. Medieval texts refer to it as the “greeter” and “teacher.” In Anglo-Saxon times, it was known as the “scythe finger,” for reasons that are murky, and as the “shooting finger,” because it was used to draw back a bowstring.\nAround the world, the index finger is associated with other functions. In Iranian languages, it is considered the finger of beckoning, cursing, and protecting. It is also known as the “prayer finger” or “testimony finger”—the label in modern Turkish—because of its use in the Muslim practice of shahada , or profession of faith. One of its most colorful nicknames was based on its penchant for swiping up sauces: the “pot licker.”\nNext up: the middle finger . English is not the only language to name this finger for its central position—the “half-way finger” is another example. Some embellish the idea: in Choctaw, it is known as the “middle son,” and in some Turkic languages, it is dubbed the “middle poplar,” evoking the image of the fingers as a stand of trees. Another salient aspect of this middlemost finger is, of course, its length. So we find monikers like the “long finger” or “tall finger,” and colorful variants like the “high grass” or “tall Turk.”\nIn Latin, the middle finger was known as the digitus impudicus or obscenus —that is, the shameless or lewd finger. Some suggest these terms were due to its use in one of our crudest gestures , but a deeper reason may lie in its appearance. The middle finger, when extended and flanked on either side, is said to resemble a penis and testicles. This phallic form is, in fact, what motivated the gesture in the first place. Another explanation for the lewdness, as one observer notes, is that this is the digit often used to stimulate the female genitals.\nFourth in line: the ring finger . Everyone will recognize the origins of this nickname in modern ring-wearing practices. But not all are aware of the deeper history behind this tradition. According to medieval belief, a nerve or artery ran from the ring finger to the heart. This notion led people to don rings on this digit. It also gave the finger a prominent role in medical lore and practice. Doctors would use the ring finger when applying treatments, for example. Such associations inspired the terms “doctor finger,” “healing finger,” “heart finger,” and “leech finger”—the last because leech was another word for physician.\nThe term “ring finger” is now found around the globe. But another, somewhat paradoxical name is also popular: the “nameless finger.” This label was once used in parts of Europe, leading Wilhelm Grimm, of fairy tale fame, to speculate about its origins. One of his ideas was that the name alludes to this digit’s squeaky-clean reputation, in contrast to that of its lewd neighbor. Another was that, because of the finger’s quasi-mystical uses in healing, some dared not speak its name.\nA simpler explanation may be in order, however. This same paradoxical label is found in Native American languages and in Chinese, making it unlikely that it stems from cultural beliefs peculiar to Europe. Rather, the nameless-ness of this finger may be due to its utter unremarkability. Sandwiched between more distinctive fingers, and not particularly useful, the ring finger is—let’s face it—the forgettable also-ran of the bunch.\nLittlest but not least: the pinky . Appearances aside, the English word has nothing to do with the color pink—rather, it was borrowed from Dutch. The deeper origins of the word are debated, but it may have stuck around because it bears a suffix (“-y”) often used in English for small, endearing things. The pinky is, after all, the loveable runt of the hand.\nA fixation on the size of this digit is found the world over. It is variously called the “baby,” “youngest child,” or “last-born daughter.” In Turkish, it is known as the “sparrow finger,” after the distinctively diminutive bird. A related idea is that this finger is a bit of a straggler. In some places, it is known as the “orphan” or “behind” finger.\nFrankly, the little finger does not do a whole lot. Terms based on its functions are thus somewhat scarce. One exception is found in Latin, where the pinky was labeled the auricularis —that is, the “ear finger.” This aural association, still found in modern French, is due to what is perhaps this finger’s most noteworthy talent: wax removal.\nThese solutions to the finger-naming problem showcase the human mind at work—and at play. In language after language, digits are named for their appearance, position, and size. They are likened to birds, dogs, and sheep, compared to chiefs, children, parents, and grandparents. They are recognized for their roles in praying, hunting, healing, cursing, licking pots, and squashing pests. Surveying this colorful compendium, we find, on the one hand, unexpected patterns and, on the other, delightful diversity.\nIs this diversity a thing of the past? Is the finger-naming problem solved once and for all? There are some signs that digital nomenclature is, like much else, headed toward global homogeneity. But the matter is hardly settled. We keep finding new uses for our hands, which could inspire new names. Cultures are constantly changing and forging new associations. This curious corner of human communication will continue to bear the hallmarks of our species’ inventiveness. Or so we can hope."], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "From the perspective of light, it would take no time at all to get to Earth because light travels at the speed of light.", "reference_documents": ["Light-year is the distance light travels in one year. Light zips through interstellar space at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second and 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers) per year.\nWe use light-time to measure the vast distances of space.\nIt’s the distance that light travels in a specific period of time. Also: LIGHT IS FAST, nothing travels faster than light.\nHow far can light travel in one minute? 11,160,000 miles. It takes 43.2 minutes for sunlight to reach Jupiter, about 484 million miles away. Light is fast, but the distances are vast . In an hour, light can travel 671 million miles.\nEarth is about eight light minutes from the Sun. A trip at light-speed to the very edge of our solar system – the farthest reaches of the Oort Cloud, a collection of dormant comets way, way out there – would take about 1.87 years. Keep going to Proxima Centauri, our nearest neighboring star, and plan on arriving in 4.25 years at light speed.\nWhen we talk about the enormity of the cosmos, it’s easy to toss out big numbers – but far more difficult to wrap our minds around just how large, how far, and how numerous celestial bodies really are.\nTo get a better sense, for instance, of the true distances to exoplanets – planets around other stars – we might start with the theater in which we find them, the Milky Way galaxy\nOur galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars, swirling in a spiral through space. Based on the deepest images obtained so far, it’s one of about 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Groups of them are bound into clusters of galaxies, and these into superclusters; the superclusters are arranged in immense sheets stretching across the universe, interspersed with dark voids and lending the whole a kind of spiderweb structure. Our galaxy probably contains 100 to 400 billion stars, and is about 100,000 light-years across. That sounds huge, and it is, at least until we start comparing it to other galaxies. Our neighboring Andromeda galaxy, for example, is some 220,000 light-years wide. Another galaxy, IC 1101, spans as much as 4 million light-years.\nBased on observations by NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope, we can confidently predict that every star you see in the sky probably hosts at least one planet. Realistically, we’re most likely talking about multi-planet systems rather than just single planets. In our galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars, this pushes the number of planets potentially into the trillions. Confirmed exoplanet detections (made by Kepler and other telescopes, both in space and on the ground) now come to more than 4,000 – and that’s from looking at only tiny slices of our galaxy. Many of these are small, rocky worlds that might be at the right temperature for liquid water to pool on their surfaces.\nThe nearest-known exoplanet is a small, probably rocky planet orbiting Proxima Centauri – the next star over from Earth. A little more than four light-years away, or 24 trillion miles. If an airline offered a flight there by jet, it would take 5 million years. Not much is known about this world; its close orbit and the periodic flaring of its star lower its chances of being habitable.\nThe TRAPPIST-1 system is seven planets, all roughly in Earth’s size range, orbiting a red dwarf star about 40 light-years away. They are very likely rocky, with four in the “habitable zone” – the orbital distance allowing potential liquid water on the surface. And computer modeling shows some have a good chance of being watery – or icy – worlds. In the next few years, we might learn whether they have atmospheres or oceans, or even signs of habitability.\nOne of the most distant exoplanets known to us in the Milky Way is Kepler-443b.

The official general election results indicate that Trump received 304 Electoral College votes and 46.09% of the popular vote (62,984,825 votes), and Hillary Clinton received 227 Electoral College votes and 48.18% of the popular vote (65,853,516 votes).\nPrior to the 2016 election, there were four times in US history when a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote : 1824 (John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson), 1876 (Rutherford B. Hayes over Samuel Tilden), 1888 (Benjamin Harrison over Grover Cleveland), and 2000 (George W. Bush over Al Gore).\nThe Electoral College was established in 1788 by Article II of the US Constitution, which also established the executive branch of the US government, and was revised by the Twelfth Amendment (ratified June 15, 1804), the Fourteenth Amendment (ratified July 1868), and the Twenty-Third Amendment (ratified Mar. 29, 1961). Because the procedure for electing the president is part of the Constitution, a Constitutional Amendment (which requires two-thirds approval in both houses of Congress plus approval by 38 states) would be required to abolish the Electoral College.\nThe Founding Fathers created the Electoral College as a compromise between electing the president via a vote in Congress only or via a popular vote only. The Electoral College comprises 538 electors; each state is allowed one elector for each Representative and Senator (DC is allowed 3 electors as established by the Twenty-Third Amendment).\nIn each state, a group of electors is chosen by each political party. On election day, voters choosing a presidential candidate are actually casting a vote for an elector. Most states use the “winner-take-all” method, in which all electoral votes are awarded to the winner of the popular vote in that state. In Nebraska and Maine, the candidate that wins the state’s overall popular vote receives two electors, and one elector from each congressional district is apportioned to the popular vote winner in that district. For a candidate to win the presidency, he or she must win at least 270 Electoral College votes.\nAt least 700 amendments have been proposed to modify or abolish the Electoral College.\nOn Monday Dec. 19, 2016, the electors in each state met to vote for President and Vice President of the United States. Of the 538 Electoral College votes available, Donald J. Trump received 304 votes, Hillary Clinton received 227 votes, and seven votes went to others: three for Colin Powell, one for Faith Spotted Eagle, one for John Kasich, one for Ron Paul, and one for Bernie Sanders). On Dec. 22, 2016, the results were certified in all 50 states. On Jan. 6, 2017, a joint session of the US Congress met to certify the election results and Vice President Joe Biden, presiding as President of the Senate, read the certified vote tally.\nA Sep. 2020 Gallup poll found 61% of Americans were in favor of abolishing the Electoral College, up 12 points from 2016.\nFor the 2020 election, electors voted on Dec. 14, and delivered the results on Dec. 23.

The majority of Americans, public opinion data show, favor the concept of higher taxes on the wealthy -- a fact of which the White House and Democrats in Congress are well aware. As White House Senior Adviser Anita Dunn wrote in a memo for her White House associates, \"The President believes that we need to restore basic fairness to the tax code, and in the process generate revenues to invest in our competitiveness, children, and economy. And, the American people agree.\"\nI entitled my review of Gallup data a couple of years ago \"Americans' Long-Standing Interest in Taxing the Rich.\" Pew Research recently summarized its data: \"Far more Americans continue to say they are bothered 'a lot' by the feeling that some corporations and wealthy people do not pay their fair share of taxes than by the complexity of the tax system or even the amount they pay in taxes.\"\nJournalists have picked up on the data. The New York Times concluded , \"A wide range of polls now show broad public support for tax increases on high earners.\" A New York Magazine headline stated, \"Biden's Tax Hike on the Wealthy Is Incredibly Popular.\" Axios reported, \"The top pollster for Joe Biden's presidential campaign is advising the White House to do something that often makes Democrats nervous: Talk loudly and proudly about raising taxes on the rich. [Pollster] John Anzalone tells Axios his extensive polling and research has found that few issues receive broader support than raising taxes on corporations and people earning more than $400,000 a year.\" And the list goes on.\nThus, it is clear that the idea of taxing the rich generally resonates with Americans' underlying attitudes. But, as is true with most things in life, nothing is unambiguous, and few things are unequivocal. What follows is a brief review of several considerations I think can be usefully taken into account by policymakers as they move forward on efforts to reduce inequality by raising taxes on the rich and wealthy.\nAlthough clear majorities of Americans approve of the idea of taxing the rich, it is by no means 100% support, despite the \"incredibly popular\" headlines. Naturally enough, opposition is highest among Republicans (over 50% opposed in a recent Quinnipiac survey). Republican congressional leaders echo this negativity among their constituents, leading to the current stalemate on Biden's tax proposals. Thus, as is true with many policy issues, majority support from the people does not always or automatically translate into congressional action.\nIt is hard to find evidence that reducing inequality is a top priority for Americans. Concern about income inequality (or, for that matter, worry that taxes on the wealthy are not high enough) rarely shows up in Gallup's monthly updates on the most important problem facing the nation. In Gallup's May update , to cite the most recent example, only 2% of Americans mentioned the gap between the rich and the poor as the biggest problem facing the nation.\nGallup's research from 2019 found that \"the distribution of income and wealth\" tied for last place in a list of possible priorities for Congress and the president. Pew Research last year concluded that \"relatively few see [economic inequality] as a top policy priority for the federal government.\" Other more recent Gallup research shows that when placed in the context of many other worries, reducing inequality of income and wealth scores at about the middle range of all issues tested.\nWith that said, the Biden administration is pitching higher taxes on the wealthy as a practical way to fund Biden's social agenda, including expanded education, childcare, paid leave, combatting climate change, and in other ways expanding the nation's social safety net. An increased sense of priority for increased taxes on the rich could be generated to the degree that such actions are positioned as a means of achieving desirable policy objectives. And polling shows that most of these policies are, in fact, favored by the American public.\nGallup, over the years, has done interesting research on the \"rich,\" and the conclusion I keep coming back to is that Americans, in some ways, like having a rich class. The majority of Americans themselves would like to be rich someday. Further, Americans believe that having rich people in society is good for that society.\nAmericans thus do not harbor the heavy resentment toward the rich that might be assumed from their agreement that income inequality should be reduced. It appears that while Americans think the rich should pay more into the tax system, Americans don't broadly view them as evil or as of no benefit to our society. Demonizing the rich thus may not be the most advisable course of action for politicians -- even as they propose to raise their taxes. President Biden has taken note of this fact and has been cautious about making it clear that he doesn't want to eradicate the rich as a class, just to force them to pay more in taxes (As Biden opined, \"We're not going to deprive any of these executives of their second or third home, travel privately by jet,\" adding, \"It's [the tax increase] not going to affect their standard of living at all.\")\nAmericans are not all enthusiastic about the idea of government intervention in the economic system. This is in part because not all Americans are enthusiastic about the government in general. For example, our annual update on views of governance last fall showed that while 83% of Democrats want the government to do more to solve the nation's problems, only 22% of Republicans agree. As I've written about extensively , the exact determination of what the government's role should or should not be in American society today is one of the contentious issues that has confronted the nation since its founding almost 250 years ago.\nI should note that reducing income inequality does not have to be done by the government. Companies can make voluntary decisions to limit how much they pay their high-ranking employees, for example, and individuals in those roles could decline to accept high levels of compensation or restrict how much they are paid. One should not hold one's breath, however, that enough of this type of voluntary reduction in high incomes will occur to make a significant difference.\nReducing inequality of income and wealth does not deal with the other important dimension involved in any discussion of the topic -- who gets to be rich and wealthy and who doesn't. The process by which each generation of Americans is sorted into socioeconomic strata is highly complex but not random by any means. There are significant relationships between one's income and wealth and the income and wealth of one's parents, one's zip code of birth, one's physical attributes (including physical attractiveness and height), and one's gender, race and ethnic status. Thus, even though we may approve of the structure of income and wealth distributions, we may not approve of the process by which individuals are sorted out and end up at the various levels of income and wealth acquisition.\nIn other words, altering inequality of results does not directly address concerns with inequality of opportunity. Critics may be happy that the gap in income between rich and poor is reduced but may remain unhappy about who gets to be rich, to begin with.\nI would summarize American public opinion on this topic by saying that a majority of Americans on average are fine with addressing income and wealth inequality by increasing taxes on the rich, but I would at the same time advise policymakers to move forward along these lines with some caution. Any increase in the use of the government to intervene in Americans' economic life walks a tightrope between desirable objectives and trepidation about government overreach, and the idea of increasing taxes on the rich provides no exception."], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

It is called socket .\nThe library is really just a very thin wrapper around the system implementation of BSD Sockets\nLet’s spend a few minutes getting to know this module.\nWe’re going to do this next part together, so open up a terminal and start a python interpreter\nThe Python sockets library allows us to find out what port a service uses:\n>>> import socket >>> socket.getservbyname('ssh') 22\nYou can also do a reverse lookup , finding what service uses a given port : small\n>>> socket.getservbyport(80) 'http'\nThe sockets library also provides tools for finding out information about hosts . For example, you can find out about the hostname and IP address of the machine you are currently using:\n>>> socket.gethostname() 'heffalump.local' >>> socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) '10.211.55.2'\nYou can also find out about machines that are located elsewhere, assuming you know their hostname. For example:\n>>> socket.gethostbyname('google.com') '173.194.33.4' >>> socket.gethostbyname('uw.edu') '128.95.155.135' >>> socket.gethostbyname('crisewing.com') '108.59.11.99'\nThe gethostbyname_ex method of the socket library provides more information about the machines we are exploring:\n>>> socket.gethostbyname_ex('google.com') ('google.com', [], ['173.194.33.9', '173.194.33.14', ... '173.194.33.6', '173.194.33.7', '173.194.33.8']) >>> socket.gethostbyname_ex('crisewing.com') ('crisewing.com', [], ['108.59.11.99']) >>> socket.gethostbyname_ex('www.rad.washington.edu') ('elladan.rad.washington.edu', # <- canonical hostname ['www.rad.washington.edu'], # <- any machine aliases ['128.95.247.84']) # <- all active IP addresses\nTo create a socket, you use the socket method of the socket library. It takes up to three optional positional arguments (here we use none to get the default behavior):\n>>> foo = socket.socket() >>> foo <socket._socketobject object at 0x10046cec0>\nA socket has some properties that are immediately important to us. These include the family , type and protocol of the socket:\n>>> foo.family 2 >>> foo.type 1 >>> foo.proto 0\nYou might notice that the values for these properties are integers. In fact, these integers are constants defined in the socket library.\nLet’s define a method in place to help us see these constants. It will take a single argument, the shared prefix for a defined set of constants:\n>>> def get_constants(prefix): ... \"\"\"mapping of socket module constants to their names.\"\"\" ... return dict( ... (getattr(socket, n), n) ... for n in dir(socket) ... if n.startswith(prefix) ... ) ... >>>\nThink back a moment to our discussion of the Internet layer of the TCP/IP stack. There were a couple of different types of IP addresses:\n- IPv4 (‘192.168.1.100’)\n- IPv6 (‘2001:0db8:85a3:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334’)\nThe family of a socket corresponds to the addressing system it uses for connecting.\nFamilies defined in the socket library are prefixed by AF_ :\n>>> families = get_constants('AF_') >>> families {0: 'AF_UNSPEC', 1: 'AF_UNIX', 2: 'AF_INET', 11: 'AF_SNA', 12: 'AF_DECnet', 16: 'AF_APPLETALK', 17: 'AF_ROUTE', 23: 'AF_IPX', 30: 'AF_INET6'}\nYour results may vary\nOf all of these, the ones we care most about are 2 (IPv4) and 30 (IPv6).\nWhen you are on a machine with an operating system that is Unix-like, you will find another generally useful socket family: AF_UNIX , or Unix Domain Sockets. Sockets in this family:\n- connect processes on the same machine\n- are generally a bit slower than IPC connnections\n- have the benefit of allowing the same API for programs that might run on one machine __or__ across the network\n- use an ‘address’ that looks like a pathname (‘/tmp/foo.sock’)\nWhat is the default family for the socket we created just a moment ago?\n(remember we bound the socket to the symbol foo ) center\nHow did you figure this out?\nThe socket type determines the semantics of socket communications.\nLook up socket type constants with the SOCK_ prefix:\n>>> types = get_constants('SOCK_') >>> types {1: 'SOCK_STREAM', 2: 'SOCK_DGRAM', ...}\nThe most common are 1 (Stream communication (TCP)) and 2 (Datagram communication (UDP)).\nWhat is the default type for our generic socket, foo ?\nA socket also has a designated protocol . The constants for these are prefixed by IPPROTO_ :\n>>> protocols = get_constants('IPPROTO_') >>> protocols {0: 'IPPROTO_IP', 1: 'IPPROTO_ICMP', ..., 255: 'IPPROTO_RAW'}\nThe choice of which protocol to use for a socket is determined by the internet layer protocol you intend to use. TCP ? UDP ? ICMP ? IGMP ?\nWhat is the default protocol used by our generic socket, foo ?\nThese three properties of a socket correspond to the three positional arguments you may pass to the socket constructor.\nUsing them allows you to create sockets with specific communications profiles:\n>>> bar = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, ... socket.SOCK_DGRAM, ... socket.IPPROTO_UDP) ... >>> bar <socket._socketobject object at 0x1005b8b40>\nWhen you are creating a socket to communicate with a remote service, the remote socket will have a specific communications profile.\nThe local socket you create must match that communications profile.\nHow can you determine the correct values to use? center\nYou ask.\nThe function socket.getaddrinfo provides information about available connections on a given host.\nsocket.getaddrinfo('127.0.0.1', 80)\nThis provides all you need to make a proper connection to a socket on a remote host. The value returned is a tuple of:\n- socket family\n- socket type\n- socket protocol\n- canonical name (usually empty, unless requested by flag)\n- socket address (tuple of IP and Port)\nNow, ask your own machine what possible connections are available for ‘http’:\n>>> socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), 'http') [(2, 2, 17, '', ('10.29.144.178', 80)), ... (30, 2, 17, '', ('fe80::e2f8:47ff:fe21:af92%en1', 80, 0, 5)), ... ] ... >>>\nWhat answers do you get?\n>>> get_address_info('crisewing.com', 'http') [(2, 2, 17, '', ('108.168.213.86', 80)), (2, 1, 6, '', ('108.168.213.86', 80))] >>>\nTry a few other servers you know about.\nSockets communicate by sending a receiving messages.\nLet’s test this by building a client socket and communicating with a server.\nFirst, connect and send a message:\n>>> streams = [info ... for info in socket.getaddrinfo('crisewing.com', 'http') ... if info[1] == socket.SOCK_STREAM] >>> info = streams[0] >>> cewing_socket = socket.socket(*info[:3]) >>> cewing_socket.connect(info[-1]) >>> msg = \"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" >>> msg += \"Host: crisewing.com\\r\\n\\r\\n\" >>> cewing_socket.sendall(msg) >>> cewing_socket.shutdown(socket.SHUT_WR)\nThen, receive a reply, iterating until it is complete:\n>>> buffsize = 4096 >>> response = '' >>> done = False >>> while not done: ... msg_part = cewing_socket.recv(buffsize) ... if len(msg_part) < buffsize: ... done = True ... cewing_socket.close() ... response += msg_part ... >>> len(response) 19427 >>> cewing_socket.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RD) >>> cewing_socket.close()\nThere are two basic methods on a socket for sending messages, send and sendall . We’re using the latter here.\n- the transmission continues until all data is sent or an error occurs\n- success returns None\n- failure to send raises an error\n- you can use the type of error to figure out why the transmission failed\n- if an error occurs you cannot know how much, if any, of your data was sent\nWith send , you send the message one chunk at a time. You are responsible for checking if a particular chunk succeeded or not, and you are also responsible for determining when the full transmission is done.\nThe recv method handles incoming messages in buffers.\n- The sole required argument is buffer_size (an integer). It should be a power of 2 and smallish (~4096)\n- It returns a byte string of buffer_size (or smaller if less data was received)\n- If the response is longer than buffer size , you can call the method repeatedly. The last bunch will be less than buffer size .\nHotice that receiving a message is not a one-and-done kind of thing\nWe don’t know how big the incoming message is before we start receiving it.\nAs a result, we have to use the Accumulator pattern to gather incoming buffers of the message until there is no more to get.\nThe recv method will return a string less than buffsize if there isn’t any more to come.\nSockets do not have a concept of the “End Of Transmission”.\nSo what happens if the message coming in is an exact multiple of the buffsize ?\nThere are a couple of strategies for dealing with this. One is to punt to the application level protocol and allow it to predetermine the size of the message to come. HTTP works this way\nThe other is to use the shutdown method of a socket to close that socket for reading, writing or both.\nWhen you do so, a 0-byte message is sent to the partner socket, allowing it to know that you are finished.\nFor more information, read the Python Socket Programming How-To .\nTonight you’ll put this to work, first by walking through a basic client server interaction, then by building a basic echo server and client."], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Evaporation leads to cooling, while boiling produces bubbles and is faster than evaporation.", "reference_documents": ["A: To complement last month’s article about condensation , we will discuss evaporation (the opposite of condensation) and the closely related phenomenon of boiling. Both evaporation and boiling involve changing a liquid to a gas, but there are a number of differences between them.\nSpeed: Evaporation is a slower process and boiling is faster. Try this: In the weeks leading up to a lesson on the water cycle (including evaporation and condensation), set a tall glass of water on a shelf, and have students measure the height of the water every few days and keep a table showing the changing level (Figure 1). If students don’t already know what’s going to happen, don’t tell them; let them discover it. They can also graph the height of the water over time. Then when you’re ready to talk about evaporation, ask, “What happened to the water that was in the glass? Where did it go?” (This investigation could also be done with students reading the amount of water remaining in a graduated cylinder, but you might prefer to have students practice making measurements with the ruler.) In contrast, you can boil water on a hot plate and watch the water level lower in a matter of minutes, rather than the days and weeks it takes for water to evaporate.\nTemperature required: A liquid will evaporate at any temperature above freezing. In the previous example, the water was at room temperature, and it slowly evaporated. If the water was warmer, it would have evaporated faster. In contrast, boiling occurs only when the liquid reaches a certain temperature, which we call the boiling point. The boiling point of water at sea level is 100°C (212°F).\nBubbles: Evaporation does not involve the formation of bubbles. When liquid evaporates, individual molecules leave the liquid and become part of the air. In Figure 2, the dots represent molecules. The ones that leave the liquid and become part of the gas (air) are evaporating. The ones that go from gas to liquid are condensing. When the water in your glass was evaporating, molecules must have been moving from the water to the air more often than molecules were moving from the air to the water. So there was a net transfer of water molecules from the liquid in the glass to the air. As you can see from Figure 2, this process does not involve any bubbles. In contrast, when you boil water, the liquid is changing to a gas so rapidly that bubbles of water vapor form. Here’s a think-pair-share question for students: When you boil water and see bubbles, is there anything in the bubbles? If so, what are the bubbles made of? Some students might think those are air bubbles. But now you understand that they’re not air bubbles; they’re bubbles of water vapor—water that has changed from a liquid to a gas. Is there an easy way to demonstrate that the bubbles contain water molecules? Yes! Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Put a lid on it for about 20 seconds, and then remove the lid and look at the inside of it. It’s covered with drops of water from those bubbles that condensed on the cooler lid (Figure 3).\nLocation of the change to a gas: You’ve probably noticed that when you heat water to bring it to boiling, bubbles first form on the bottom of the pot. (Students wearing safety goggles can observe this close up.) That’s because, at first, the bottom of the pot is the only place where it’s hot enough to heat the water to the boiling point and change it to a gas. But once you have a rolling boil, the entire pot of water is at the boiling point (100°C), and bubbles form throughout the bulk of the water. Evaporation, on the other hand, occurs only at the surface of the water. (Recall Figure 2, showing the evaporating molecules leaving the surface of the water.)\nSource of energy: Boiling usually requires an external source of energy, such as the burner under the pot of water in which you’re boiling your eggs. Evaporation, however, uses the energy already in the liquid. If you have a puddle of water, it has some heat energy, which usually just came from the environment. The heat in that water results in some molecules moving fast enough to escape into the air, that is, evaporate. No additional source of energy is required for evaporation, and the water does not need to reach the boiling point to evaporate. As we’ve seen, water will evaporate at room temperature. What you just read implies that evaporation, but not boiling, is a natural process. Your puddle of water or the water on your hair that you just washed will evaporate without you doing anything special. Just wait, and it dries. But boiling does not usually happen naturally. We have to deliberately heat the liquid to get it to boil.\nTemperature change of the liquid: While water is boiling, its temperature remains constant at 100°C. A rolling boil doesn’t make the water any hotter than a medium boil. Your eggs will cook just as fast either way. On the other hand, evaporation of water will cool the water—and any surface that the water is evaporating off of. That’s why if you wait to dry off after you step out of the shower, you feel cold. The evaporating water molecules carry away heat from your skin. This is also why you perspire on a hot, summer day. The additional moisture on your skin results in more evaporation, which cools your skin. So don’t wipe that sweat off your brow; let it evaporate, and you’ll feel cooler!\nWhy did I say, “at sea level”? Because at high altitudes, the air pressure is lower. With lower air pressure, there’s less of a “lid” on the water, and it can change to a gas at a lower temperature. Any cooks out there? I just picked up my old copy of Joy of Cooking, in which the authors include how cooking instructions must be modifi ed at high altitudes. For example, in the soup section, they say, “Above 2,500 feet, soups need longer cooking periods than called for in the regular recipes, as the liquids boil at a lower temperature.” There’s so much cool science in cooking! Remind me to do an article on that.\nAsk students, “What can we do to make water evaporate faster?” Here are some things that affect how fast a liquid will evaporate:\nHeat. Clothes drying on a clothesline will dry faster on a summer day than in winter.\nWind. If you step out of an outdoor swimming pool when the wind is blowing, you feel colder because the wind causes the water to evaporate faster from your skin, carrying away heat energy from your skin faster, leaving your skin colder (Figure 4). This effect is also the cause of the “wind chill factor” that we hear about in weather reports on cold, winter days. You weren’t in a swimming pool, but your skin always has some moisture on it. The wind causes that moisture to evaporate faster, carrying away more heat from your skin. That’s why it’s important to stay covered up on cold, windy days.\nHumidity. Water evaporates faster when the air is dry. When the air is dry, there are fewer water molecules in the air returning to the liquid, so the water evaporates faster. When the air has many water molecules in it (i.e., it is humid), like on a rainy day, evaporation is slower because more water molecules return to the liquid. Try this investigation: Put an equal amount of water in three identical jars. Leave one uncovered, cover another one with aluminum foil, and cover the last jar with a tightly fitting lid (Figure 5). Based on what we’ve learned, what would you expect to see after a few days to a week? The tighter the lid, the less evaporation. But why, exactly? Students might suggest that, with the lid on a jar, the water molecules have no place to go. You can respond, “Yes, but can’t the water molecules still go into the air above the water in the jar?” They can, but that will result in a lot more water molecules in the air in the jar (higher humidity) and a lot more water molecules returning to the liquid (as in Figure 2). It quickly gets to the point where the number of water molecules returning to the liquid is equal to the number leaving the liquid, so there’s no net change in the amount of liquid water (i.e., no evaporation). That’s a much more sophisticated explanation than the lid simply holding in the water. You probably won’t need to go into that much detail with your students, but you’ll have a lot more confidence in your content knowledge if you understand the process in-depth.\nSurface area. Increasing surface area will provide more surface from which water can evaporate. So a wet towel will dry faster if it’s spread out rather than left folded or bunched up.\nTo summarize, evaporation is slower, occurs only from the surface of the liquid, does not produce bubbles, and leads to cooling. Boiling is faster, can occur throughout the liquid, produces lots of bubbles, and does not result in cooling.\nBetween last month’s article and this one, you’re ready to discuss the water cycle. In its simplest form, the water cycle is how water changes from being water vapor (a gas) to liquid water (condensation) and then back to a gas (evaporation). Holy cow, it just hit me how many real-life applications we found for this one simple topic. There’s so much to discover in our day-to-day activities. That’s why I always say, “Never stop learning!”\nMatt Bobrowsky is the lead author of the NSTA Press book series, Phenomenon-Based Learning: Using Physical Science Gadgets & Gizmos .

The film series started with a trilogy set in medias res that was later expanded to a trilogy of trilogies, known as the \" Skywalker Saga \".\nThe 1977 self-titled film , later subtitled Episode IV – A New Hope , was followed by the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), respectively subtitled onscreen as Episode V and Episode VI ; these films form the original trilogy . Sixteen years later, the prequel trilogy was released, consisting of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). After creator George Lucas sold the Star Wars franchise to Disney in 2012, a sequel trilogy consisting of Episodes VII through IX was released, consisting of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nThe first three spin-off films produced were the made-for-television Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), The Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985). Following Disney's 2012 acquisition of the franchise, these earlier films were dropped from the official canon , but the theatrical animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) and its television series continuation retain their canonical status. Two standalone films were produced and released between the sequel trilogy films: Rogue One (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), both set between the original and prequel trilogies. Untitled movies from Taika Waititi , James Mangold , Dave Filoni , and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy have been officially announced as being written, while other unspecified films are reportedly in early stages of development. [a]\nThe combined box office revenue of the films amounts to over ten billion dollars, and it is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise . The major live-action releases (including all the films within the Skywalker Saga) were nominated for Academy Awards . The original film was nominated for most of the major categories, including Best Picture , Best Director , Best Original Screenplay , and Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness (who played Obi-Wan Kenobi ), while all theatrical live-action films have been nominated for particular categories. Several official Star Wars television series have also been released, all now on Disney+ .\nThe main Star Wars film series is a trilogy of trilogies; as it neared completion, Disney began to refer to it as the \"Skywalker Saga\". [1] [2] It was released beginning with the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI , 1977–1983), followed by the prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II and III , 1999–2005) and the sequel trilogy (Episodes VII, VIII and IX , 2015–2019). [b] The first film released, Star Wars (1977), is the fourth film chronologically and was later subtitled Episode IV – A New Hope . The saga begins chronologically with Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) and concludes with Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nThe story follows each generation of the Force -sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against the evil Sith Lord Darth Sidious (Palpatine) . The prequel trilogy focuses on Anakin Skywalker , his training as a Jedi , and his eventual fall to the dark side as Darth Vader due to Palpatine's machinations and his fear of losing his wife Padmé Amidala . The original trilogy follows their children, Luke and Leia , as they join the Rebel Alliance and battle Vader, Palpatine, and his Galactic Empire . The sequel trilogy features Kylo Ren (Ben Solo)—the son of Leia and Han Solo , nephew and former Jedi apprentice of Luke, and grandson of Padmé and Anakin—who fell to the dark side and seeks to rule the galaxy with Rey , the granddaughter of Palpatine and the last Jedi apprentice of Luke and Leia.\nEach episodic film begins with an opening crawl , accompanied by the main Star Wars theme by John Williams , who composes the scores for each film. All nine films—most notably the original trilogy—have had retroactive changes made after their initial theatrical releases.\n|Film||U.S. release date||Director||Screenwriter(s)||Story by||Producer(s)||Refs|\n|Prequel trilogy|\n|Episode I – The Phantom Menace||May 19, 1999||George Lucas||Rick McCallum||[3]|\n|Episode II – Attack of the Clones||May 16, 2002||George Lucas||George Lucas and Jonathan Hales||George Lucas||[4] [5]|\n|Episode III – Revenge of the Sith||May 19, 2005||George Lucas||[6] [7]|\n|Original trilogy|\n|Episode IV – A New Hope||May 25, 1977||George Lucas||Gary Kurtz||[8] [9]|\n|Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back||May 21, 1980||Irvin Kershner||Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan||George Lucas||[10] [11]|\n|Episode VI – Return of the Jedi||May 25, 1983||Richard Marquand||Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas||Howard Kazanjian||[12] [13]|\n|Sequel trilogy|\n|Episode VII – The Force Awakens||December 18, 2015||J.

[19] The first theatrical films set outside the main episodic series were the Ewok spin-off films Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985), the first of which was screened internationally after being produced for television . [20]\nAfter the conclusion of his then-six-episode saga in 2005, Lucas returned to spin-offs in the form of television series . An animated film, The Clone Wars (2008), was released as a pilot to a TV series of the same name . An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy, [21] described by Disney chief financial officer (CFO) Jay Rasulo as origin stories . [22] The first entry, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans directly before Episode IV . [23] [24] Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) focuses on Han's backstory, also featuring Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian .\n|Film||Release date||Director||Screenwriter(s)||Story by||Producer(s)||Refs|\n|The Clone Wars||August 15, 2008||Dave Filoni||Henry Gilroy , Steven Melching, and Scott Murphy||George Lucas, Dave Filoni, and Henry Gilroy||Catherine Winder||[25]|\nPreceding the airing of the animated TV series in late 2008, the theatrical feature Star Wars: The Clone Wars was compiled from episodes \"almost [as] an afterthought.\" [26] [27] It reveals that Anakin trained an apprentice between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith ; the series explains Padawan Ahsoka Tano 's absence from the latter film.

[21] In February 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger made public the development of a Kasdan film [31] and Entertainment Weekly reported that it would focus on Han Solo. [32] Disney CFO Jay Rasulo has described the standalone films as origin stories . [22] Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that there was \"no attempt being made to carry characters (from the standalone films) in and out of the saga episodes.\" [33] The standalone films are subtitled \"A Star Wars Story\" . [23] [34]\nMain article: Rogue One\nRogue One is set directly before Episode IV: A New Hope and focuses on the eponymous group of rebels who obtain the plans to the Death Star. [35] Its laser was developed by scientist Galen Erso (played by Mads Mikkelsen ) after the Empire forcibly abducted him, separating him from his daughter Jyn . Galen secretly sends a defecting Imperial pilot, Bodhi Rook , to deliver a message warning of the weapon's existence and revealing its weakness to his rebel friend Saw Gerrera . Under the false promise of her father's liberation, Jyn agrees to help Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor and his droid K-2SO retrieve the message from Saw, now the paranoid leader of an extremist cell of rebels.\nThe idea for the movie came from John Knoll , the chief creative officer of Industrial Light & Magic . [36] In May 2014, Lucasfilm announced Gareth Edwards as the director of an anthology film, with Gary Whitta writing the first draft for a release on December 16, 2016. [37] The film's title was revealed to be Rogue One , with Chris Weitz rewriting the script, and Felicity Jones in the starring role. [38] Ben Mendelsohn and Diego Luna also play new characters, [39] with James Earl Jones returning to voice Darth Vader . [40] Edwards stated, \"It comes down to a group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy.\" [41] The film was the first to feature characters introduced in animated Star Wars TV series, namely The Clone Wars ' Saw Gerrera, portrayed by Forest Whitaker in the film. The movie received generally positive reviews, with its performances, action sequences, soundtrack, visual effects and darker tone being praised. The film grossed over US$500 million worldwide within a week of its release. [42]\nSolo , the second anthology film, focuses on Han Solo about 10 years before A New Hope . [35] After an escape attempt from his Imperial-occupied home planet of Corellia goes wrong, a young Han vows to return to rescue his girlfriend Qi'ra . Han \"Solo\" joins the Imperial Academy; however, he is expelled for his reckless behavior. Han and his newfound Wookiee friend Chewbacca resort to a criminal life, mentored by veteran smuggler Tobias Beckett . After angering gangster Dryden Vos, Han and his company's lives depend on pulling a heist for him. Without a ship to travel, they hire Lando Calrissian , the captain and owner of the Millennium Falcon .\nBefore selling Lucasfilm to Disney, George Lucas had hired Star Wars original trilogy veteran Lawrence Kasdan to write a film about a young Han Solo. [21] The film stars Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo, Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca (after serving as a double for the character in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi ), Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, and Woody Harrelson as Beckett. Lucasfilm originally hired Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to direct, but they were fired during principal photography , and replaced by Ron Howard . A twist ending acknowledges one of the major story arcs of The Clone Wars and Rebels animated series, while leaving the story open ended for sequels. [43]\nIn mid-2018, Lucasfilm confirmed that multiple anthology films were in development, [44] with their release following a hiatus after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker . [45] Two films are scheduled for December 2025 and 2027. [46] [c]\nKathleen Kennedy stated in May 2022 that \"There's a couple of [filmmakers] that we've been in conversation with over quite a long period of time that I'm hoping will come in\" to oversee future films in the same way that Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni have done for multiple Star Wars television series. [48] Kennedy stated that \"We need to create a whole new saga\" [49] and that the sequel trilogy era was likely to be expanded from. [50]\nThree separate new live-action films were officially announced at April 2023's Star Wars Celebration : a film about the dawn of the Jedi (set 25,000 years before A New Hope ) by James Mangold , a Dave Filoni-helmed film concluding the story set up by The Mandalorian and its spin-offs, and a Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy -helmed film set 15 years after The Rise of Skywalker , with Daisy Ridley reprising her role as Rey. [51] [52] Upcoming films were announced to include the trademark opening crawl.

THR reported that according to its sources, \"the project is intended as a stand-alone but in success could lead to more movies\", taking place after the sequel trilogy and possibly featuring some of its characters. [54] [55] [56] In March 2023, it was reported that Lindelof and Britt-Gibson had left the project in mid-February and that Steven Knight was hired to replace them as screenwriter. Filming was reportedly set to begin in February 2024. [57] [58]\nAt April 2023's Star Wars Celebration, Kennedy officially announced a Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy-directed movie, with Daisy Ridley returning as Rey as she constructs a new Jedi Order 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker . [51] She reportedly may be a supporting character in the vein of Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker in the original and sequel trilogies, respectively. [59] Lucasfilm reportedly hoped to release the film on the next scheduled date planned for a Star Wars film: December 19, 2025. [60]\nOn May 4 , 2020, Taika Waititi (who directed the first-season finale of The Mandalorian and voiced IG-11 ) was officially announced to direct a Star Wars film from a screenplay he was co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns . [61] As of May 2022, his film was expected to be released before Rogue Squadron [62] (originally scheduled for December 2023 prior to its delay), [48] [47] with Kathleen Kennedy asserting that Waititi's film may be released in late 2023. [63] In June 2022, Waititi agreed with Kennedy's view that the films should move into new territory in favor of origin stories, [64] and stated he would continue writing the project through the end of 2022 while filming other projects. [65] In early July, The Hollywood Reporter indicated that \"an early 2023 start\" was being considered. [66] The movie will reportedly be shot in Los Angeles. [67] By March 2023, Waititi was also likely to appear in the film. [68] By April 2023, Kennedy stated that Waititi was now writing the film alone. [69] At the beginning of May 2023, Deadline Hollywood stated that filming for his film would begin in 2024. [70]\nRian Johnson , the writer/director of The Last Jedi (2017), is confirmed to write and direct the first film of a new trilogy he was outlining as of early 2019 with Ram Bergman producing alongside Kennedy. [71] [72] [73] It was said to differ from the Skywalker-focused films in favor of focusing on new characters and possibly a different era than the main film franchise. [74] The project was considered to have been \"back-burnered\" by May 2022 due to Johnson's involvement with other projects, including the Knives Out franchise. [62] In October, Johnson indicated that he would make at least one more film in that series before returning to Star Wars . [75] By April 2023, Kennedy agreed with Johnson that he would return to Star Wars after at least one more Knives Out film. [76]\nIn November 2022, Deadline Hollywood reported that Shawn Levy was in talks to direct a Star Wars film, following his work on Deadpool 3 (2024) and the fifth and final season of Stranger Things . [77]\nThe first spin-off film (also the first sequel to be released) was a holiday TV special aired in 1978. Two live-action TV films created in the mid-1980s feature the Ewoks.\n|Film||Release date||Director||Screenwriter(s)||Network|\n|Star Wars Holiday Special||November 17, 1978||Steve Binder||Pat Proft , Leonard Ripps, Bruce Vilanch , Rod Warren and Mitzie Welch||CBS|\nProduced for CBS in 1978, the Star Wars Holiday Special was a two-hour television special, in the format of a variety show . Stars of the original film and archive footage from the original Star Wars film appeared alongside celebrity guest stars in plot-related skits, musical numbers, and an animated segment, all loosely tied together by the premise of Chewbacca 's family waiting for his arrival for the \"Life Day\" celebration on his home planet, Kashyyyk . The special is notorious for its extremely negative reception and was aired only once. [78] Only the 11-minute animated sequence, which features the debut of bounty hunter Boba Fett , was positively received. [79]\nThe Ewoks from Return of the Jedi were featured in two spin-off television films, The Ewok Adventure and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor . Both aired on ABC on the Thanksgiving weekends of 1984 and 1985, respectively, [80] with at least the first also being given a limited international theatrical release. [20] Warwick Davis reprised his debut role as the main Ewok, Wicket , in both. [81] [82] They are set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi . [83] Both films were released on VHS, LaserDisc, and on a double-feature DVD. Although based on stories written by George Lucas, they do not bear Star Wars in their titles, and were considered to exist in a lower level of canon than the episodic films. Following Disney's acquisition of the franchise, they were excluded from the canon.

[162]\nIn early 2013, Bob Iger announced the development of a spin-off film written by Simon Kinberg , [163] reported by Entertainment Weekly to focus on bounty hunter Boba Fett during the original trilogy. [164] In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, [165] but had left the project a year later due to creative differences, [166] causing a teaser for the film to be scrapped from Star Wars Celebration. [167] By October 2018, the Fett film [e] was reportedly no longer in production, with the studio instead focusing on The Mandalorian , which utilizes a similar character. [169]\nRogue One and Solo actors Felicity Jones, Alden Ehrenreich and Emilia Clarke all stated that their contracts also included future installments. [170] [171] [172] Solo director Ron Howard said that while no sequel was in development, it was up to the fans to decide. [173] Kennedy and Glover also said that a film focusing on Lando could happen, but was not a priority. [174] (A Lando series was later announced.) [175] Although critics noted that Solo left room open for sequels, [45] in 2022, Howard confirmed that the studio had no plans to make one. [176]\nIn August 2017, it was rumored that films focused on Jabba the Hutt , and Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda were being considered or were in development. [177] Stephen Daldry was reportedly in early negotiations to co-write and direct the Obi-Wan movie. [178] At D23 Expo in August 2019, a TV series about the character was announced to be produced instead, which was released in 2022. [179]\nGame of Thrones creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss were to write and produce a trilogy of Star Wars films scheduled to be released in December 2022, 2024, and 2026, [180] which were first announced to be in development in February 2018. [181] The duo stepped away from the project in October 2019, citing their commitment to a Netflix deal, although Kennedy stated her openness to their returning when their schedules allow. [182] [180]\nIn April 2019, Kathleen Kennedy was asked by MTV News about a potential Knights of the Old Republic adaption and stated, \"Yes, we are developing something to look at. Right now, I have no idea where things might fall.\" [183] The following month, BuzzFeed News reported that Laeta Kalogridis had been hired in the spring of 2018 to write a film based on the 2003 video game , and that she was close to completing the first script of a potential trilogy.

[186] [f] In May 2022, Waldron confirmed the project was moving forward and that it would more or less stand alone, [188] however in a separate interview the same month Kennedy denied that the film was in active development. [62] By March 2023, it was reportedly confirmed to no longer be in development. [68] Contrary to earlier comments, Kennedy clarified the following month that the project was more something conflated through the media, that \"nothing ever got developed. We never discussed an idea... If [Feige] did come up with something, I would be all ears. But, that's never really happened, so it's not an abandoned project. It just never really happened.\" [189]\nJ. D. Dillard and Luke Cage writer Matt Owens were reportedly involved in the early stages of developing a film in February 2020, [190] which may have taken place on the Sith planet Exegol . [191] In November 2022, Dillard announced that he was no longer involved in the project. [192]\nOn December 10, 2020, during Disney Investor Day, Wonder Woman (2017) director Patty Jenkins was announced as the director of a film titled Rogue Squadron , initially set to be released on December 22, 2023. [193] [c] [g] According to the official Star Wars website, the film would \"introduce a new generation of starfighter pilots as they earn their wings and risk their lives in a boundary-pushing, high-speed thrill-ride, and move the saga into the future era of the galaxy.\" [175] According to Jenkins, the film would be an original story \"with great influence from the games and the books \". [194] A script was being worked on as of December 2020, [195] at which time, Wonder Woman 3 's story was still being worked on. [196] Matthew Robinson was hired to write Rogue Squadron in May 2021; [197] [198] late the next month, Jenkins revealed that the script was almost finished. [199] On November 8, the film's production was delayed from 2022 due to Jenkins' busy schedule. [200] A month later, Jenkins had left her planned Cleopatra film as director in order to focus on Rogue Squadron and Wonder Woman 3 . [201] Disney announced in April 2022 that the film was still set to be released in December 2023. [202] Kathleen Kennedy stated in May that the film has been \"pushed off to the side for the moment\", with the script still being worked on and Waititi's film expected to be released first. [48] On September 15, 2022, the film was confirmed to be taken off from Disney's release schedule, [47] although in December Jenkins said she was actively working on it amid the apparent cancellation of Wonder Woman 3 . [203] By March 2023, fans reported it as no longer in development. [68] The following month, Kennedy stated the project could still happen either as a film or a television series.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Cream of tartar can be replaced with vinegar or lemon juice in a 1:2 ratio.", "reference_documents": ["Cream of tartar is a fine, white powder that's typically sold in the spice and baking section of the grocery store. When you don't have any cream of tartar in the pantry, don't worry. You may be able to use lemon juice, vinegar, or baking powder, or skip it entirely. Which substitute is best depends on the role cream of tartar plays in your recipe.\nThere are a few possible substitutes for cream of tartar. Before deciding which ingredient to use, think about what cream of tartar brings to the recipe. You'll also want to consider any undesirable flavor changes that might occur.\nWhile these substitutions will give you good results, the finished product might still come out a bit differently than you're used to. Expect subtle changes in texture and appearance because that's just the nature of substitutions.\n- Lemon Juice : Use an equal amount of lemon juice to replace cream of tartar in a recipe. Lemon juice has a similar acidity and the flavor is pleasant, so it works in many recipes. It prevents the crystallization in syrups and frostings and will help stabilize egg whites.\n- White Vinegar : Use an equal amount of distilled white vinegar instead of cream of tartar in recipes that require an egg white stabilizer. Be judicious about this substitution in baked goods because it can alter the taste and texture.\n- Baking Powder : When a recipe uses both baking soda and cream of tartar, replace both ingredients with baking powder and you won't notice a difference. Baking powder is comprised of two parts cream of tartar to one part baking soda, so it's important to keep the proportions intact. For example, use one teaspoon of baking powder to replace 2/3 teaspoon of cream of tartar and 1/3 teaspoon of baking soda.\n- Buttermilk : The acidity of buttermilk may work in some baked good recipes. Since it's a liquid, you will need to reduce another liquid, so it's not an ideal substitute. Use 1/2 cup of buttermilk for every 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar, then eliminate 1/2 cup of liquid from the recipe.\n- Yogurt : Also a decent substitution for baked goods, yogurt can be used as a substitute for cream of tartar. Use the same measurement as buttermilk, replacing 1/2 cup of the recipe's liquid for each 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar. Yogurt is not as fluid, and you may need to thin it out a bit to reach the consistency of buttermilk.\nCream of tartar is the powdered form of tartaric acid, a substance that forms at the bottom of barrels when making wine. 1 Its acidic properties are useful in recipes for three specific reasons:\n- Stabilizes Egg Whites: You'll frequently see meringue pie and soufflé recipes call for a pinch of cream of tartar. It's the ingredient that helps meringue maintain its high peaks, even after a trip through the oven.\n- Acts as a Leavening Agent: In cookies, pancakes, and other yeast-free baked goods, cream of tartar may be combined with baking soda. The resulting chemical reaction makes your treats fluffier.\n- Prevents Sugar From Crystallizing: In frostings , icings, and syrups, adding cream of tartar can keep sugar from crystallizing and result in a creamier texture.\nIn most cases, you can simply leave the cream of tartar out. The food may not be as fluffy or perfect as you hope, but it will still work out and taste good. There is a slight risk that your meringue will lose some of its height or collapse, especially when baking.\nWhen the cream of tartar is used to prevent sugar crystallization, no substitution is necessary. It's mostly a precautionary measure. If you're making a simple syrup that you plan to store for an extended time, it may crystallize eventually. That can be easily remedied by reheating it in the microwave or on the stove.\nAs long as you keep your cream of tartar in an air-tight container, and away from light, heat, and moisture, it should keep for a few years , if not indefinitely. Don't sweat it if the container in your pantry is so old that you don't even remember when you bought it—just dust it off and put it back into service."], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "To become a chemistry teacher, one must have a bachelor's degree in chemistry or another physical science, a master's degree, or a doctorate.", "reference_documents": ["By\nChron Contributor\nUpdated September 04, 2020\nThe American Chemical Society reports that high school science teachers are in demand, particularly those who can teach chemistry and physics. Secondary school chemistry teachers need a minimum of a bachelor's degree, and those who teach in public schools must fulfill additional state requirements, which may mean graduate credits or a master's degree. Chemistry teachers need graduate degrees to teach at the college level.\nThe basic requirement for high school chemistry teachers is a bachelor's degree in chemistry. As explained on the employment website ZipRecruiter , a state-issued teaching certificate is mandatory to teach in the public schools. Requirements vary by state so it's important to check with an academic advisor to be sure you're taking all the necessary courses.\nSample courses for a chemistry degree include biology, physics, calculus, general chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry and chemistry labs. In addition, teacher preparation includes classes in psychology, instructional techniques and methods of dealing with students. Prospective teachers must complete supervised practice teaching and pass state examinations. For chemistry teachers, these typically include a general test for all teachers plus a chemistry certification exam.\nMany chemistry teachers also have master's degrees in education or chemistry. Some states require teachers to complete a master's degree as part of the final certification process. In addition, alternative certification programs often award master's degrees. In these programs, students who already have bachelor's degrees take education classes and do supervised student teaching to become certified. Alternately, bachelor's degree graduates can qualify to teach in two-year colleges and technical schools by completely a master's in chemistry.\nMost four-year colleges and universities require teachers to have a doctorate in the field they teach, although sometimes part-time jobs go to those with master's degrees. A Ph.D. degree in chemistry usually takes six years beyond the bachelor's degree and includes both supervised research and specialized coursework.\nThe employment website PayScale reports that chemistry teachers earned an average of $50,017 per year as of 2020, with typical salaries ranging between $36,000 and $77,000 . Pay varies state to state and even among school districts within a state. Other factors affecting salary include level of education and number of years in the teaching profession.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), jobs for high school teachers overall will grow by 4 percent through 2029, a rate considered average when compared to other jobs.. Chemistry teachers, however, will have better prospects than most because of the scarcity of qualified applicants.\nFor post-secondary teachers, the BLS predicts a 9 percent job growth rate through 2029, which is much faster than average growth. As is the case with high school jobs, those qualified to teach chemistry may have even more opportunities than teachers of other subjects. According to the BLS, the 2019 median pay for postsecondary teachers was $79,540 . Median salary means that half in the profession earned more, while half earned less.\nReferences\nResources"], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

Astronomers can measure how near to a perfect circle an orbit is by calculating its 'eccentricity'.\nThis is expressed by a number that is between 0 and 1. The closer the eccentricity is to 0, the closer the orbit is to a circle. In fact, a circle can be thought of as a special kind of ellipse that has an eccentricity of 0.\nVenus’ orbit is the least eccentric out of all of the planets in our Solar System and closest to a circle, with a value of 0.007. Mercury’s is the most eccentric with a value of 0.2.\nThe eccentricity of the Moon’s orbit is 0.05 . Furthermore, the Earth is not at the very centre of the Moon’s orbit either. It is located at one of the foci of the Moon’s elliptical orbit, so is closer to one edge of the orbit than the other.\nAstronomers tend to talk about three different numbers when talking about the distance between the Earth and the Moon.\nAt its furthest point from the Earth, the Moon is about 405 696 km (252 088 miles) away and astronomers say that the Moon is at apogee (‘apo’ means ‘away’).\nOn the other hand, when the Moon is at perigee (‘peri’ means ‘near’), the Moon is at its closest approach to the Earth . The distance between them is only 363 104 km (225 623 miles).\nThese two figures differ by 42 592 km (26 465 miles) - more than three times larger than the diameter of the Earth! The average distance between the Earth and the Moon is 384 400 km (238 855 miles) .\nThe Moon’s elliptical orbit with the distances at apogee and perigee. Note that the Earth is not at the very centre of the orbit and that the eccentricity of the orbit has been exaggerated here!

The full Moon will look slightly bigger if it occurs during perigee (sometimes called a supermoon) and slightly smaller at apogee (a micromoon). However, the difference won’t be easily noticeable to the naked eye and a side by side photographic comparison is the only way to really see it.\nComparison between a micromoon and a supermoon. Supermoons appear to be 14% larger and 30% brighter than a micromoon. Credit: Marcoaliaslama.\nOur tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun and the Earth’s rotation . High tides are highest and low tides are lowest when it is a full moon or a new moon because of the gravitational pull of our natural satellite and star add up. These tides are called spring tides, as the tides spring out and spring back, they do not have anything to do with the spring season. At perigee, the Moon’s gravitational pull will be slightly stronger than usual and so the difference between high and low tides would be larger – but only by about 5cm! Similarly, when the Moon is at apogee, the difference between high and low tides will only be about 5cm smaller than usual.\nThe biggest tides occur when the Sun, Moon and Earth align because the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon combine. Neap tides are smaller and occur when the Sun and Moon are perpendicular to each other. Credit: NASA/Luc Viator/HalloweenNight/Affelia Wibisono.\nSince the Moon orbits the Earth and the Earth orbits the Sun, both the Moon and the Earth are the same average distance away from the Sun. On average, the Earth and Moon are about 150 million kilometres (or 93 million miles) from the Sun!\nThat distance is so large that it takes light eight minutes to reach us (remember that light travels at 300,000 kilometres per second). That means that if the Sun were to stop shining right now, we wouldn’t know for another eight minutes.\nOn average it would take three days , but it depends on how fast you are travelling and the exact route you take. It also depends on what you want to do – passing by the Moon does not require you to slow down to enter its orbit, minimising the time it would take to get there.\nThe record for the shortest journey time to the Moon is currently held by the New Horizons spacecraft with a time of 8 hours and 35 minutes.\nThe first spacecraft to attempt to reach the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 1 in 1959. Unfortunately, it did not slow down enough to complete its mission, but it did reach the vicinity of the Moon within 34 hours (1 day 10 hours).\nSMART 1 , a European Space Agency spacecraft powered by an ion engine, was launched in 2003. It was very fuel efficient but did take 13.5 months to complete its journey!\nHuman space travel will usually take longer than robotic ones. On average, the nine crewed missions to the Moon, (including Apollo 8, Apollo 10, Apollo 13 and the six that landed on the surface) took just over 78 hours (3 days 6 hours) to enter lunar orbit. The quickest was Apollo 8 which took 2 days, 21 hours and 8 minutes, while Apollo 17 took the longest with a time of 3 days, 14 hours and 41 minutes (times include the time spent in Earth orbit).\nIf you were driving at a speed of 40mph it would take approximately 5,791.375 hours to get to the Moon. However, this depends on whether the Moon is in apogee or perigee - and what kind of rocket car you have of course.\nThe lunar phase cycle takes 29.5 days to complete , and is directly connected to the orbit of the Moon around the Earth. However this is not how long it takes for one orbit to complete. Instead the Moon takes 27.3 days to orbit the Earth once .\nThis difference comes from how you measure the motions of objects in space. As there are no truly fixed points in space to measure against, you are forced to use objects that are considered not to move to within a reasonable level of uncertainty.\nVery distant stars and galaxies, while all technically in motion, don’t noticeably move in the sky on human timescales. Therefore they can be considered fixed.\nIf you measure how the Moon orbits compared to these distant stars you get 27.3 days, the true orbital period of the Moon. However, the phases of the Moon are dependent on how the Moon, Earth and Sun are placed. During the time the Moon orbits the Earth, the Earth has moved on in its orbit around the Sun. In effect, the Moon needs a couple of extra days to catch up and return to the same point in space relative to the Sun. Hence the 29.5 day lunar phase cycle.\nYou may have noticed that the full Moon always looks about the same. You always see the same pattern of craters, hills, valleys and mare (seas) on the full Moon. In fact if you look at any phase of the Moon, it will always show the same features, though not all of the features will be lit up.\nThis is because the Moon spins at the same rate as it orbits around the Earth, with the exception of a couple of minor wobbles (known as libration) that brings a little more of the Moon into view. This means we only ever see the near side of the Moon from Earth, and never the far side. This is sometimes known as the “dark side” of the Moon - not because it actually is dark, but because it was mysterious and unknown until humans explored it.\nThe result is a very slowly rotating Moon: it takes 29.5 days to go from midday to midday on the Moon. Daylight lasts about two weeks and night time another two weeks. That, coupled with the lack of an atmosphere on the Moon, means the temperature changes wildly from over 100°C during the day to around -150°C at night.\nAstronomers have discovered that the Moon is currently moving away from the Earth by 3.8 cm every year!\nAstronauts from the Apollo 11, 14 and 15 missions and the two Soviet Union rovers, Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2 , left a total of five mirrors on the surface of the Moon. Astronomers on Earth can reflect laser beams off these mirrors and record the time it takes for the laser to return. We know how fast the laser beam is travelling (the speed of light) so we can easily calculate the distance that the laser beam has travelled. The Earth-Moon distance would then be half of this value.\nThis would mean that in the far future, total solar eclipses would be a thing of the past as the Moon will appear to be smaller: therefore, its disc will not be large enough to completely obscure the Sun. It will eventually stop receding from the Earth in about 50 billion years’ time according to theory. However, the Sun would have already entered the next stage of its life long before that happens. As it expands into a red giant star in 5 billion years or so, it will push the Moon back towards the Earth causing it to disintegrate due to strong tidal forces.\nThis article has been written by an astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich\n01/06/2018: Affelia Wibisono"], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "While scientists have made liquid water as cold as -50 Fahrenheit (-45 Celsius), it is not recommended to drink water at such low temperatures.", "reference_documents": ["By\nYou’re definitely familiar with water’s freezing point: 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius). But that’s not the coldest water could be. “Supercooled” water is water that exists below that point. Scientists in a few labs have now made the coldest water yet.\nOne team of researchers got their liquid water as cold as 230 Kelvin, and another down to 228 Kelvin—that’s around -50 Fahrenheit (-45 Celsius). This is cool for science reasons alone, since this “deeply supercooled” region is difficult to probe with experiments. But there are other reasons: Water is weird and super important for understanding this planet we live on. And it doesn’t always obey the rules you learned in high school: It can exist as a liquid at temperatures as low as -31 degrees F (-35 degrees C) in our own atmosphere, and it has strange properties that only get weirder at temperatures that cold. Right around these cold temperatures, in fact, it reaches a sort of weird mathematical kink, also known as a “singularity.”\n“Yet what sort of singularity might water be approaching still represents an unresolved puzzle that has prompted the formulation of conflicting scenarios to interpret its origin,” the authors write in one of the studies published last week in Physical Review Letters, lead by Ph.D student Claudia Goy from the Institute for Nuclear Physics at Goethe University, Frankfurt. Another team from Sweden, Korea and Japan may have reached that singularity, and published their paper last month in Science.\nHere’s a reminder: physicists use temperature simply as the average kinetic energy of a collection of molecules. Basically, the less the molecules move around and vibrate, the lower their temperature. This isn’t really temperature like stepping into the arctic. It’s describing the behavior of a tiny collection of particles in a system built by physicists.\nWhether those molecules actually begin to “freeze,” or form a crystal, depends on a host of other factors. It requires an initial crystal, or nucleus, to form and begin attracting other molecules. Water prefers to be a crystal at temperatures below its freezing point, but scientists can build systems which prevent that crystallization. Some of water’s physical properties are unlike those of other liquids, too: think about how water expands when it freezes, something that normally doesn’t happen in other liquids\nBoth teams created their own super-cold water by shooting jets of tiny droplets into a vacuum. The smaller the droplet, the colder they’d be able to make it while still keeping it a liquid. Small droplets are also less likely to crystallize from foreign particles. Dividing into smaller pieces exposes more of them to the vacuum, leading to a strange kind of vacuum cooling. Essentially, lowering the pressure causes the particles on the surface to quickly evaporate off. This quickly removes the heat from the droplets and causes their temperature to drop precipitously. The droplets, when measured, record frigid temperatures.\nTaking that temperature is difficult, too. Both experiments used laser pulses to measure the droplets as they traveled and evaporated in the vacuum. Observing how the diameter of the water droplets change as they leave the nozzle gives the researchers a number they can turn into a temperature using a mathematical formula.\nThis might seem like a roundabout way to measure temperature, but “you cannot put a thermometer next to the droplets and say ‘okay, this is the temperature,’” Renato Torre from the European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy who was not involved in the research, told Gizmodo. Still, he felt that the methods used by the researchers support the claims in the paper. He also wondered if this would open a debate as to the most reliable temperature-taking methods in these experiments.\nAs for the singularity, the group who got their water down to 228 Kelvin definitely noticed some weirdness: The water appeared to exist with two different density phases simultaneously, based on how clusters of a few connected water molecules stacked up in the droplets. Computer modeling demonstrated that this surprising result could explain water’s weird density behaviors, explained Tim Wogan for PhysicsWorld.\nPaola Gallo from Roma Tre University in Italy called that experiment important in a commentary for Science. But another researcher, Alan Soper from the UK’s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, told Wogan that he didn’t think one could draw detailed conclusions, and that perhaps the changes observed by that team were the beginning of the water crystallizing. “They’ve clearly seen something and it’s very interesting,” he said, “But what’s actually causing it is probably something we don’t have a straightforward answer to.”\nRegardless, water is important. It’s present in the clouds, in our tissues, and required to understand all sorts of phenomena present on our planet. And scientists are only beginning to understand its extremes."], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

All you need is a vinyl record, heat resistant bowl, cookie sheet, oven mitts and of course a oven and a few minutes of free time.\nMy brother came over last week and handed me a beautiful bowl filled with succulents. Since he is always making things from scratch I asked him how he made it, I couldn’t believe he made it out of a vinyl record! He quickly reminded me we used to make them all the time as kids, for the life of me I can not remember. In my defense, my brothers and I have a huge age gap between us, so when they were teens making bowls out of records I was just a little toddler getting into trouble. So a huge thanks to my amazing brother for giving me this idea!\nOver the weekend I stopped by our local Good Will store hoping I could find a record since I donated all of mine years and years ago. To my surprise, they had hundreds of them, each for $1.99. If I had the time I would have sat on the floor and gone through them one by one but I only had a few minutes. I was lucky enough to quickly find Frankie Laine, It brought back memories of my beautiful mom playing his music when she was cooking in the kitchen, the song “I Believe” was one of her favorites.\nAmazon links listed below\nSupplies\nDirections:\nMake sure you have adequate ventilation for this project — melting vinyl can produce harmful fumes.\nWash both sides of the record with soap, rinse, and dry it with a lint-free cloth. This removes any lint, pet hair, or other debris that may stick to the record after melting.\nYou will want to pick an oven-safe bowl that is about the shape and size that you want your bowl to be.\nPreheat the oven to 200 degrees (do not set the oven any higher then 200 or toxic fumes could be released)\nStack the bowl on top of the cookie sheet, place the record centered on top. . The side of the record placed directly on top of the bowl will become the inside of the vinyl bowl.\nPlace in oven for about 8-10 minutes.\nUsing oven mitts, take the bowl, and cookie sheet and record out of the oven. Take the record off of the bowl and start shaping it by bending and pinching until you get the look you want. You will need to work quickly before it hardens. *this is what the record will look like when it’s ready to be pulled out of the oven\nYou can use the inside of another bowl to help with forming the edges, just place the record inside.\nYou can always place it back in the oven to soften it up again for a few minutes if you don’t like the results ( I might have done this twice)\nLeave the album black or have a little fun with paint, I spray-painted mine for a pop of color! I simply layered red and pink spray paint, I did not let coats dry in between each spray so they would mix. You can use these as decorative bowls, a catch-all for keys, jewelry, junk, or make a beautiful planter out of it.\n*Note I would not put any type of food in the bowl especially if you have spray-painted it.\nIt almost reminds me of a beautiful clam shell.\nHere is the succulent planter my brother made, isn’t it gorgeous!\nI can spritz the plants with water about once a week and if it ever needs extra water it has a hole at the bottom for drainage!\nHave fun with them, you really can’t go wrong or make a mistake, they would make such a fun and funky gift as well.\nTime to check out all the other thrift store makeovers!\nVinyl Record Bowl My Uncommon Slice of Suburbia\nDIY Earring Holder House of Hawthornes"], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Root cause analysis (RCA) is a collective term that describes a wide range of approaches, tools, and techniques used to uncover causes of problems, such as Pareto Charts, 5 Whys, Scatter Plot Diagrams, and Fishbone Diagrams.", "reference_documents": ["Eventually all manufacturing processes will experience problems with non-conforming parts, equipment failure resulting in lost productivity or rework expenses and possible increased scrap. Even with the best quality systems, training and Statistical Process Control (SPC) , problems can happen. What must be prevented are the repeat problems. The problems you thought were resolved only to reoccur. Repeat problems can be experienced in everyday life. If you compare a manufacturing process to a garden, the process problems would be the weeds in the garden. If you pull up a dandelion and don’t get the entire root it will just keep popping back up. It is much the same with manufacturing problems – if you don’t get to the root cause of the problem, it is eventually (if not frequently) going to re-occur. The goal of a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is to get down to the true cause of the problem, the root cause.\nRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) is a comprehensive term encompassing a collection of problem solving methods used to identify the real cause of a non-conformance or quality problem. Root Cause Analysis is the process of defining, understanding and solving a problem. The root cause has also been described as an underlying or fundamental cause of a non-conformance, defect or failure. Furthermore, the term “root cause” can also be referred to as the precise point in the causal chain where applying a corrective action or intervention would prevent the non-conformance from occurring.\nRepeat problems are a source of waste in manufacturing. Waste in the form of machine downtime, product rework, increased scrap and the time and resources spent “fixing” the problem. Many times we may believe that the problem is resolved but in reality we have just addressed a symptom of the problem and not the actual root cause. Correctly performed, a Root Cause Analysis can identify breakdowns in your processes or systems that contributed to the non-conformance and determine how to prevent it from happening again. An RCA is performed to identify what happened, why it happened and then determine what improvements or changes are required. Through the proper application of RCA, repeat problems can be eliminated.\nRCA methods and tools are not limited to manufacturing process problems only. Many industries are applying RCA methodology in various situations and are using this structured approach to problem solving. Some examples of where RCA is being used include, but are not limited to:\n- Office Processes and Procedures\n- Quality Control Problems\n- Healthcare Incident Analysis\n- Safety-based Situations or Accident Analysis\n- Failure Analysis in Engineering and Maintenance\n- Change Management or Continuous Improvement Activities\n- Computer Systems or Software Analysis\nThe point is that RCA can be applied to almost any type of problem that companies face every day. Another example where RCA could be used is for a company that is experiencing a high level of incorrect customer orders and shipments. The process can be mapped, analyzed and the root cause (s) of the problems can be identified and resolved. The end result is a happy, loyal customer-base and lower overall cost to the company.\nRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) is usually a step in a larger problem solving exercise. There are multiple tools that may be used during a Root Cause Analysis. Some of them can sometimes be completed by one person, but in most cases a Cross Functional Team (CFT) approach will reap the greatest benefits and increase chances of reaching the true “root cause”.\nThere are also several problem solving methods that use Root Cause Analysis within their problem solving process, such as Eight Disciplines of Problem Solving (8D) , Six Sigma / DMAIC , or Kaizen . The RCA is a critical step in each of these examples.\nBefore RCA can be performed, the problem must be well defined. The following information must be determined and documented:\n- Who discovered the problem?\n- What exactly happened?\n- Where in the process was the problem discovered?\n- When was the problem discovered?\n- How many / How often does it happen?\n- How was the problem detected?\nNext, the team may want to collect data or other additional information. It may also be necessary to initiate interim containment or corrective actions. The team should review all gathered information and further define the problem. The problem should be defined based on facts and data. Once the problem is fully described the team can then begin the Root Cause Analysis phase.\nThe Team should be comprised of personnel that have direct knowledge of the process being examined and responsibility for implementing any permanent corrective actions. In addition, the team should include representatives from Quality, Process Engineering and, when appropriate, team members from the next step in the process or from other shifts. Each member of the CFT will bring their own knowledge and view of the process and the non-conformance.\nThere are multiple tools that could be utilized during a Root Cause Analysis. This section will cover some of the tools including how and when they could be of value to the analysis. The first step is to determine what is included and what is not included in the problem investigation using the Is/Is Not analysis.\nThe “Is/Is Not” analysis may be used at different points in the RCA. It can be used while defining the problem to determine what is in scope and will be considered during the analysis and what is out of scope and will not be considered. It can also be used when planning a solution, to help the team decide what to include and what to exclude. The Is-Is Not analysis allows the team to think about the problem and the boundaries of what it is or is not. The tool helps the team maintain their focus. If the boundary of the problem is not clearly defined the team may stray off the initial path and work on solving inconsequential problems.\nDocument what “Is” and “Is Not” part of or a characteristic of the problem. The process works by asking the team various questions such as:\n- Who is impacted by this problem?\n- Does the team have the authority to resolve this issue?\n- What do we already know about the problem?\n- Is this something that will impact the customer?\n- Will we actually do something about this?\nAsk the team enough questions until there is a clear definition of the problem / scope of the problem solving process.\nThe Ishikawa or Fishbone Diagram is a useful tool in determining the most likely causes (MLCs) of a quality problem. The diagram is sometimes referred to as a Fishbone Diagram because it looks much like a skeleton of a fish with the effect or problem being listed in a box at the end. The main sections of the diagram are used to address the 6Ms (Man, Material, Method, Machine, Measurement and Mother Nature (Environment). The diagrams are usually worked right to left, with each large “bone” of the fish branching out to include smaller bones with additional details. It is important not to limit the teams brainstorming ideas here. If an idea is in a different section of the diagram, simply list it in the appropriate section and then go back to it later. Once the team has brainstormed all the possible causes of the problem, the team should rate the potential causes according to their level of importance and likelihood of contributing to the failure and develop a hierarchy. From the hierarchy the team should select which causes to further investigate.\nThe 5 Why method is simply asking the question “Why” enough times until you get through all the symptoms of a problem and down to the root cause. The 5 Whys is often used during the problem solving activities. It is also used in coordination with other analysis tools, such as the Cause and Effect Diagram, but can also be used as a standalone tool. The 5 Whys is most effective when the answers come from people who have hands-on experience of the issue being examined. To discover the root cause of a problem, keep asking “why”. By repeating “why”, you can drive down to the root cause of the problem. A general rule of thumb is that you should reach the 3rd to 5th “why”, or you may just address a symptom of the problem and not the actual root cause. The 5 Why Form can sometimes have three separate areas (or “legs”) to address the 5 Whys: Why it occurred, Why it was not detected and Why our systems failed. Each area should be explored and you may have more than one causal progression for each area.\nFailure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a well-defined tool that can identify various modes of failure within a system or process. In many companies if a major problem is detected in the process or product, the team is required to review any existing FMEAs in relation to the problem. The team should determine if the problem or effect of the failure was identified in the FMEA and if it was, how accurately the team evaluated the risk. If the problem is not included in the FMEA, the team should add any known information and then complete the following steps:\n- List the current problem as a failure mode of the design or process\n- Identify the impact of the failure by defining the severity of the problem or effect of failure\n- List all probable causes and how many times they occur\n- When reviewing a process FMEA, review the process flow or process diagram to help locate the root cause\n- Next identify the Escape Point, which is the closest point in the process where the root cause could have been detected but was not\n- Document any controls in place designed to prevent or detect the problem\n- List any additional actions that could be implemented to prevent this problem from occurring again and assign an owner and a due date for each recommended action\n- Carry any identified actions over to the counter-measure activity of the RCA\nOnce the team has determined the root cause using any combination of the tools listed above then they must develop the appropriate counter-measures or corrective actions. In addition, the team should develop an action plan for implementation of the counter-measures.\nThe counter-measures are usually divided into two categories:\n- Short-term or immediate counter-measures – generally accomplishable in less than 1 week. If not it should be designated as a “Long-term” counter-measure.\n- Long-term or permanent counter-measures – usually more complex and may require additional resources to complete. All “Long-term” counter-measures should be able to complete in less than 1 month. If not, they should be forwarded to the Continuous Improvement (CI) team for evaluation as part of a Kaizen or Black Belt project.\nThe corrective action must be clearly defined and achievable by the team member assigned to complete the task. The action plan should also contain expected due dates for each of the corrective actions. It is often discovered that corrective actions without an owner or an expected due date seldom get completed. Occasionally the counter-measures require tasks to be completed by more than one of the team members simultaneously or in a certain order. The action plan should be used to track progress of individual action items required to complete implementation of the countermeasures.\nThe team should also determine a Verification (or Validation) Plan. This is used to provide a documented performance appraisal of the counter-measures effectiveness. This could entail recording data or auditing any special controls developed and implemented during the RCA exercise. Evidence should be collected to verify the effectiveness of the counter-measures or corrective actions. In addition, it is good practice to re-assemble the team approximately 30 days after the permanent counter-measures are in place. The team should review the effectiveness of the counter-measures and determine if the problem has occurred since implementation of the counter-measures. The team should also review the process (if applicable) to assure all counter-measures are being followed.\nThe development of a robust, well-planned Root Cause Analysis (RCA) process can be very valuable to the company by determining the root cause and taking action to prevent it from re-occurring. The lessons learned during an effective RCA can often be carried over to similar designs or processes. This should initiate a problem solving continuous improvement mind-set to spread throughout the company.\nQuality-One offers Quality and Reliability Support for Product and Process Development through Consulting, Training and Project Support.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The federal Lanham Act and the FTC Act both prohibit unfair or deceptive advertising.", "reference_documents": ["The Internet is connecting advertisers and marketers to customers from Boston to Bali with text, interactive graphics, video and audio. If you're thinking about advertising on the Internet, remember that many of the same rules that apply to other forms of advertising apply to electronic marketing. These rules and guidelines protect businesses and consumers - and help maintain the credibility of the Internet as an advertising medium. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has prepared this guide to give you an overview of some of the laws it enforces.\nAdvertising must tell the truth and not mislead consumers.\nIn addition, claims must be substantiated.\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act allows the FTC to act in the interest of all consumers to prevent deceptive and unfair acts or practices. In interpreting Section 5 of the Act, the Commission has determined that a representation, omission or practice is deceptive if it is likely to:\n- mislead consumers and\n- affect consumers' behavior or decisions about the product or service.\nIn addition, an act or practice is unfair if the injury it causes, or is likely to cause, is:\n- substantial\n- not outweighed by other benefits and\n- not reasonably avoidable.\nThe FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive advertising in any medium. That is, advertising must tell the truth and not mislead consumers. A claim can be misleading if relevant information is left out or if the claim implies something that's not true. For example, a lease advertisement for an automobile that promotes \"$0 Down\" may be misleading if significant and undisclosed charges are due at lease signing.\nIn addition, claims must be substantiated , especially when they concern health, safety, or performance. The type of evidence may depend on the product, the claims, and what experts believe necessary. If your ad specifies a certain level of support for a claim - \"tests show X\" - you must have at least that level of support.\nSellers are responsible for claims they make about their products and services. Third parties - such as advertising agencies or website designers and catalog marketers - also may be liable for making or disseminating deceptive representations if they participate in the preparation or distribution of the advertising, or know about the deceptive claims.\nAdvertising agencies or website designers are responsible for reviewing the information used to substantiate ad claims. They may not simply rely on an advertiser's assurance that the claims are substantiated. In determining whether an ad agency should be held liable, the FTC looks at the extent of the agency's participation in the preparation of the challenged ad, and whether the agency knew or should have known that the ad included false or deceptive claims.\nTo protect themselves, catalog marketers should ask for material to back up claims rather than repeat what the manufacturer says about the product. If the manufacturer doesn't come forward with proof or turns over proof that looks questionable, the catalog marketer should see a yellow \"caution light\" and proceed appropriately, especially when it comes to extravagant performance claims, health or weight loss promises, or earnings guarantees. In writing ad copy, catalogers should stick to claims that can be supported. Most important, catalog marketers should trust their instincts when a product sounds too good to be true.\nOther points to consider:\nDisclaimers and disclosures must be clear and conspicuous. That is, consumers must be able to notice, read or hear, and understand the information. Still, a disclaimer or disclosure alone usually is not enough to remedy a false or deceptive claim.\nDemonstrations must show how the product will perform under normal use.\nRefunds must be made to dissatisfied consumers - if you promised to make them.\nAdvertising directed to children raises special issues. That's because children may have greater difficulty evaluating advertising claims and understanding the nature of the information you provide. Sellers should take special care not to misrepresent a product or its performance when advertising to children. The Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has published specific guidelines for children's advertising that you may find helpful.\nDot Com Disclosures: Information About Online Advertising , an FTC staff paper, provides additional information for online advertisers. The paper discusses the factors used to evaluate the clarity and conspicuousness of required disclosures in online ads. It also discusses how certain FTC rules and guides that use terms like \"writing\" or \"printed\" apply to Internet activities and how technologies such as email may be used to comply with certain rules and guides.\nThe Internet provides unprecedented opportunities for the collection and sharing of information from and about consumers. But studies show that consumers have very strong concerns about the security and confidentiality of their personal information in the online marketplace. Many consumers also report being wary of engaging in online commerce, in part because they fear that their personal information can be misused.\nThese consumer concerns present an opportunity for you to build on consumer trust by implementing effective voluntary industry-wide practices to protect consumers' information privacy. The FTC has held a number of workshops for industry, consumer groups and privacy advocates to explore industry guidelines to protect consumers' privacy online.\nIn June 1998, the FTC issued Online Privacy: A Report to Congress. The Report noted that while over 85 percent of all websites collected personal information from consumers, only 14 percent of the sites in the FTC's random sample of commercial websites provided any notice to consumers of the personal information they collect or how they use it. In May 2000, the FTC issued a follow-up report, Privacy Online: Fair Information Practices in the Electronic Marketplace. While the 2000 survey showed significant improvement in the percent of websites that post at least some privacy disclosures, only 20 percent of the random sample sites were found to have implemented four fair information practices: notice, choice, access and security. Even when the survey looked at the percentage of sites implementing the two critical practices of notice and choice, only 41 percent of the random sample provided such privacy disclosures. You can access the FTC's privacy report at www.ftc.gov.\nThe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC's implementing Rule took effect April 21, 2000. Commercial websites directed to children under 13 years old or general audience sites that have actual knowledge that they are collecting information from a child must obtain parental permission before collecting such information.\nThe FTC also launched a special site at www.onguardonline.gov/topics/kids-privacy.aspx to help children, parents and site operators understand the provisions of COPPA and how the law will affect them.\nListed here are some FTC laws about specific marketing practices and the promotion of\nproducts and services in specific industries.

Or visit the FTC at www.ftc.gov.\nThe Franchise and Business Opportunity Rule requires franchise and business opportunity sellers to give consumers a detailed disclosure document at least 10 days before the consumer pays any money or legally commits to a purchase. The document must include:\n- the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of other purchasers;\n- a fully-audited financial statement of the seller;\n- the background and experience of the business's key executives;\n- the cost of starting and maintaining the business; and\n- the responsibilities of the seller and purchaser once the purchase is made.\nIn addition, companies that make earnings representations must give consumers the written basis for their claims, including the number and percentage of owners who have done at least as well as claimed.\nSee Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures .\nMLM - also known as \"network\" or \"matrix\" marketing - is a way of selling goods and services through distributors. These plans typically promise that people who sign up as distributors will get commissions two ways - on their own sales and on the sales their recruits have made.\nPyramid schemes - a form of multi-level marketing - involve paying commissions to distributors only for recruiting new distributors. Pyramid schemes are illegal in most states because the plans inevitably collapse when no new distributors can be recruited. When a plan collapses, most people - except those at the top of the pyramid - lose their money.\nMLMs should pay commissions for the retail sales of goods or services, not for recruiting new distributors. MLMs that involve the sale of business opportunities or franchises, as defined by the Franchise Rule, must comply with the Rule's requirements about disclosing the number and percentage of existing franchisees who have achieved the claimed results, as well as cautionary language.\nSee Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures .\nThe Truth in Lending Act requires creditors who deal with consumers to disclose information in writing about finance charges and related aspects of credit transactions, including finance charges expressed as an annual percentage rate. In addition, the Act establishes a three-day right of rescission in certain transactions involving the establishment of a security interest in the consumer's principal dwelling (with certain exclusions, such as interests taken in connection with the purchase or initial construction of a dwelling). The Act also establishes certain requirements for advertisers of credit terms.\nSee Truth in Lending Act .\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act is important if you are a creditor billing customers for goods or services. The Act requires you to acknowledge consumer billing complaints promptly in writing and to investigate billing errors. The Act prohibits creditors from taking actions that adversely affect the consumer's credit standing until the investigation is completed, and affords other consumer protections during disputes. The Act also requires that creditors promptly post payments to the consumer's account, and either refund overpayments or credit them to the consumer's account.\nSee The Fair Credit Billing Act .\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) - such as credit bureaus and resellers of consumer reports - that provide information to creditors, insurers, employers, and others, do so with due regard for the confidentiality, accuracy, and legitimate use of such data. When those parties take adverse action on the basis of information in a credit report, they must identify the CRA that provided the report so that the consumer can learn how to get a copy to verify or contest its accuracy and completeness. Creditors and others may not knowingly provide false information to CRAs, which are required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of their data.\nSee Fair Credit Reporting Act , Credit Reports: What Information Providers Need to Know, Using Consumer Reports: What Employers Need to Know , and Consumer Reports: What Insurers Need to Know.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits lenders from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance income, or an applicant's good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The ECOA requires creditors to provide applicants with the reasons credit was denied if the applicant asks.\nSee Equal Credit Opportunity Act .\nThe Electronic Fund Transfer Act establishes the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfer systems. The EFTA requires participants to adopt certain practices when they deal with transaction accounting and preauthorized transfers and error resolution, and sets liability limits for losses caused by unauthorized transfers.\nSee Electronic Fund Transfer Act .\nThe Consumer Leasing Act regulates personal property leases that exceed four months and are made to consumers for personal, family, or household purposes. The statute requires that certain lease costs and terms be disclosed, imposes limitations on the size of penalties for delinquency or default and on the size of residual liabilities, and in some instances, requires certain disclosures in lease advertising.\nIt's deceptive to misrepresent - directly or indirectly - that a product offers a general environmental benefit. Your ads should qualify broad environmental claims - or avoid them altogether - to prevent deception about the specific nature of the benefit. In addition, your ads shouldn't imply significant environmental benefits if the benefit isn't significant. Say a trash bag is labeled \"recyclable\" without qualification. Because trash bags ordinarily are not separated from other trash for recycling at a landfill or incinerator, it is unlikely that they will be used again. Technically, the bag may be \"recyclable,\" but the claim is deceptive because it asserts an environmental benefit where there is no significant or meaningful benefit.\nSee Environmental Advertising and Marketing Practices Guide, and Complying with the Green Guides.\nA product that's advertised as free if another is purchased - \"buy one, get one\" - indicates that the consumer will pay nothing for the one item and no more than the regular price for the other. Ads like these should describe all the terms and conditions of the free offer clearly and prominently.\nSee Guide Concerning the Use of the Word Free and Similar Representations .\nThe FTC's Jewelry Guides tell you how to make accurate and truthful claims about jewelry you offer for sale.\nThe Guides cover claims made for gold, silver, platinum, pewter, diamonds, gemstones, and pearls and define how certain common terms may be used in ads. For example, the Guides explain when a product can be called \"gold plated\" or when a diamond can be called \"flawless.\"\nThe Guides also describe information that sellers should disclose in their ads so that consumers are not misled. For example, if you sell synthetic or imitation gemstones, you must tell the consumer that the gemstone is not natural. In addition, you should tell consumers if the pearls that you are selling are cultured or imitation, so that consumers are not misled about the type of pearl being offered.\nSee Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals and Pewter Industries .\nAccording to the Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule , you must have a reasonable basis for stating or implying that a product can be shipped within a certain time. If your ad doesn't include a shipping statement, you must have a reasonable basis to believe you can ship within 30 days.\nIf you can't ship when promised, you must notify the customer of the delay and the right to cancel. For definite delays of up to 30 days, you may treat the customer's silence as agreement to the delay. For longer or indefinite delays, and second and subsequent delays, you must get the customer's consent. If you don't, you must promptly refund all the money the customer paid you without being asked.\nYou can give updated shipping information over the phone if your Internet ad prompts customers to call to place an order. This information may differ from what you said or implied about the shipping time in your ad. The updated phone information supersedes any shipping representation made in your ad, but you still must have a reasonable basis for the update.\nSee Complying with the FTC’s Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule\nThe Negative Option Rule applies to sellers of subscription plans who ship merchandise like books or compact discs to consumers who have agreed in advance to become subscribers. The Rule requires ads to clearly and conspicuously disclose material information about the terms of the plan. Further, once consumers agree to enroll, the company must notify them before shipping to allow them to decline the merchandise. Even if an automatic shipment or continuity program doesn't fall within the specifics of the Rule, companies should be careful to clearly disclose the terms and conditions of the plan before billing consumers or charging their credit cards.\nSee Negative Option Rule .\nThe 900-Number Rule requires that ads for pay-per-call services disclose the cost of the call. Ads for services that promote sweepstakes or games of chance, provide information about a federal program (but are not sponsored by a federal agency), or target individuals under 18 years of age require additional disclosures. Ads for 900-numbers cannot be directed to children under 12 unless the ads deal with a bona fide education service, as defined by the Rule.\nSee Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act and Complying with the 900-Number Rule .\nAdvertisements promoting credit repair, promising loans for a fee in advance, or touting investment opportunities may trigger application of the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule if the ad allows consumers to order goods or services by telephone. In general, this Rule does not apply to general media advertisements. If you're advertising credit repair, advance fee loans, or investment opportunities, or offering to recover money paid in previous telemarketing transactions, however, the Rule likely applies to you. Among other things, the Rule requires that certain disclosures be made before a customer pays for the goods or services. The Rule also prohibits material misrepresentations.\nSee Complying with the Telemarketing Sales Rule .\nTestimonials and endorsements must reflect the typical experiences of consumers, unless the ad clearly and conspicuously states otherwise. A statement that not all consumers will get the same results is not enough to qualify a claim. Testimonials and endorsements can't be used to make a claim that the advertiser itself cannot substantiate.\nConnections between an endorser and the company that are unclear or unexpected to a customer also must be disclosed, whether they have to do with a financial arrangement for a favorable endorsement, a position with the company, or stock ownership. Expert endorsements must be based on appropriate tests or evaluations performed by people that have mastered the subject matter.\nSee FTC Guides Concerning Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising .\nThe Rule on Pre-Sale Availability of Written Warranty Terms requires that warranties be available before purchase for consumer products that cost more than $15. If your ad mentions a warranty on a product that can be purchased by mail, phone or computer, it must tell consumers how to get a copy of the warranty.\nSee Pre-Sale Availability of Written Warranty Terms Rule .\nIf your ad uses phrases like \"satisfaction guaranteed\" or \"money-back guarantee,\" you must be willing to give full refunds for any reason. You also must tell the consumer the terms of the offer.\nSee Guides for the Advertising of Warranties and Guarantees , A Businessperson’s Guide to Federal Warranty Law , and Consumer Product Warranties .\nThe Textile and Wool Acts require you to disclose country of origin information in catalogs and other mail order advertising and in Internet ads that sell textile and wool products. The description of each advertised item must include a statement that it was made in the U.S.A., imported or both. A general statement in your ads that all products are either made in the U.S.A. or imported is not adequate.\nAds that say or imply anything about fiber content must disclose the generic fiber names (as assigned by the FTC) in order of predominance by weight. This requirement applies to all ads, whether or not they solicit direct sales. It is not necessary to state the percentage of each fiber, but fibers present in an amount less than 5 percent should be listed as \"other fiber(s).\" (There is an exception to the 5 percent requirement for fibers that have a functional significance even in an amount less than 5 percent.)\nSee Textile Fiber Products Identification Act and Calling It Cotton: Labeling and Advertising Cotton Products.\nA product has to be \"all or virtually all made in the United States\" for it to be advertised or labeled as \"Made in the U.S.A.\"\nSee Enforcement Policy Statement on U.S. Origin Claims .\nThe FTC periodically joins with other law enforcement agencies to monitor the Internet for\npotentially false or deceptive online advertising claims.\nIf your advertisements don't comply with the law, you could face enforcement actions or civil lawsuits. For advertisers under the FTC's jurisdiction, that could mean:\norders to cease and desist, with fines up to $50,120 per violation should they occur.\ninjunctions by federal district courts. Violations of some Commission rules also could result in civil penalties of up to $40,654 per violation. Violations of court orders could result in civil or criminal contempt proceedings.\nin some instances, refunds to consumers for actual damages in civil lawsuits.\nThe FTC works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid them.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "There is a lot of debate as to whether a universal basic income (UBI) should be implemented.", "reference_documents": ["27th May 2021\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) could be designed to reduce poverty, improve income security and boost well-being, but could be expensive and challenging to introduce. Many of its goals could be achieved through changes to the existing social security system and addressing the underlying causes of insecurity in the labour and housing markets.\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI, Citizens’ Basic Income – CBI, or simply Basic Income) is an idea whose time appears to have come. The Welsh Government has committed to trialling it, the Scottish Government has invested in the feasibility of pilots, several English cities are keen to test it out and a number of political parties included UBI trials in their manifestos. But is it really the right basis on which to build a post-pandemic society? What problems is it trying to solve? Is it the only or the best solution to those issues?\nThere are many models but at its heart it is a regular cash payment every individual receives, without any reference to their other income or wealth and without any conditions. Payment amounts can vary according to broad demographic characteristics, such as a different payment for working-age adults, children and pensioners.\nIt is important to distinguish UBI from a Minimum Income Guarantee, which at its most basic is simply a set of policies designed to ensure no one falls below a set income level.\nSome argue that Universal Basic Income is part of a radical rethinking of our economy and society, that provides a level of economic security to everyone and destigmatises the social security system. It is also seen as a potential solution to insecurity in the labour market.\nThe social security problems which UBI could help to address include -\n- Coverage. Too many people locked out of the support they need, due to:\nPolicy design - for example, deficiencies in maternity and paternity pay, support whilst training, and low-earning workers without Statutory Sick Pay.\nNon-take up - due to stigma, lack of awareness, mistakes, the difficulty or unpleasantness of the system.\nDropping out of the system - because of conditions or treatment.\nSanctions - losing part or all of your benefits because you are deemed not to have met the conditions of receipt.\nDelays, errors and problems with benefits - which can result in people having to go for long periods of time with little or no income.\n- Adequacy. High poverty rates for some groups even when they receive social security and are meeting work or activity requirements, demonstrate its current inadequacy. Official food insecurity statistics show 4 in 10 Universal Credit claimants can’t even afford food. Providing a high enough universal payment could ensure everyone has the resources to meet basic standards of living, preventing poverty or destitution.\n- Uncertainty. Many people, particularly those on low incomes, emphasise the importance of having predictable and stable payments. Yet people often experience variable and unpredictable fluctuations in benefit payments.\n- Complexity. Any system which tailors support to individual circumstances will entail some complexity. Introducing ever more means-testing and conditions attached to various benefits requires more complex systems and processes.\n- Dignity, respect and well-being. Not all benefit claimants experience problems or feel they are treated poorly. But some find the culture of our social security system suspicious, disrespectful and undignified. There is evidence of the negative impact of these experiences on people’s mental health. Over many years, the ramping up of conditionality and means testing has been accompanied by a narrative of ‘scroungers and skivers’, a presumption that there are large numbers of people trying to game the system, and a drive to reduce claimant numbers.\nSome advocates also argue that UBI could improve work incentives, if it was either not withdrawn at all as people earned more or was withdrawn at a lower rate than in the current benefit system. (Although others worry that the incentive to enter work at all might be reduced if people could rely on a high enough income outside it, discussed further below).\nAlongside problems in our social security system, many advocates also see UBI as a response to increasing insecurity in our labour market. Too often low-paid jobs are unpredictable and insecure. Workers don’t know what shifts or hours they will be working from one week to the next or how long the job will last. People cycle in and out of low-paid, temporary jobs, never able to rely on a steady income. UBI could provide a fixed income stream to offset this earnings volatility. In addition, some argue that UBI would free people to choose whether to take paid work or care for others, train or do other activities, and would recognise the value to society of such activities. In this scenario, it might bring wider benefits through better job matches and people holding out for better quality work, creating pressure on employers to pay more and achieve greater productivity. There are also wider debates about the extent to which automation may lead to significantly fewer jobs or climate change may necessitate such major economic changes that there will be a new norms of people doing much less paid work. For some, UBI is a necessary accompaniment to such radical economic changes.\nFinally, there are a range of other arguments put forward for UBI which do not relate to poverty, social security or labour market insecurity, such as the idea it would reduce the level of state involvement in people’s lives. In this piece, we focus on the arguments relating to poverty and insecurity. There are, of course, versions of UBI which would significantly increase poverty by reducing the support provided to those on low incomes, but we assume these would not be proposed by those aiming to reduce poverty.\nMost UBI proposals now include two features, in contrast to some earlier proposals which intended to replace all benefits with UBI or introduce UBI without accompanying tax changes. Alongside flat payments, there would continue to be a system of benefits linked to costs. A system of flat payments alone could not offer adequate support with varying costs of housing, childcare or disability. This means that there would continue to be a degree of complexity and means-testing even if UBI was introduced (sometimes known as UBI+ ), and that efforts to improve the existing system must continue. Second, UBI would replace parts of the tax system as well as social security. Most likely, the tax-free personal allowance would be removed, so people would pay tax on the entirety of their earned income. Depending on the design, many on lower- to middle-incomes would more than recoup this in the universal payment.\nA key design question is obviously the level at which UBI is set. Would it be based below, at, or just above current benefit levels? Or provide much higher payments, for instance at the level of JRF’s Minimum Income Standard?* This would be the main determinant of both the cost of UBI and its immediate impact on poverty levels.\nA recent study by the Fraser of Allander Institute, Manchester Metropolitan University and IPPR Scotland, examined the costs and benefits of a Citizen’s Basic Income in Scotland at current benefit or at Minimum Income Standard level. These costs relate to introducing the scheme in Scotland; those for a UK-wide version would be much higher. However, estimates of necessary tax rate increases would be similar whether in Scotland or across the whole country.\nA UBI based on current benefit levels would bring clear gains for those who are currently ineligible, where they are on a low income but are shut out, or fall out, of the existing system; it would probably bring smaller gains for many of those successfully claiming current benefits. Fraser of Allander et al estimates the costs and impacts of introducing this kind of UBI in Scotland. This scheme would require £7 billion in net additional funding (after existing benefits have been reduced and the tax-free personal allowance eliminated), paid for by increasing all tax rates by eight percentage points. UBI at this level would deliver lower levels of poverty and greater income security (reducing the number of people in poverty in Scotland by a quarter and child poverty by a third). However, it seems unlikely to achieve wider goals of significantly reducing insecurity and allowing more people to choose whether to care, train, or hold out for better jobs.\nIntroducing a higher level of UBI, for instance at Minimum Income Standard level , would potentially achieve these benefits and almost eradicate poverty in Scotland, but would be extremely expensive. Fraser of Allander et al estimates this would require £38 billion in net additional funding (again, after existing benefits have been reduced and the tax-free personal allowance eliminated). If funded through income tax it would require tax rates to start at 58p for the first £1 earned and rise to 85p for the higher and top rates. The Minimum Income Standard is significantly higher than the poverty line. An alternative would be to set UBI rates at or around the poverty line. This would be less costly than a version based on the Minimum Income Standard but still very expensive.\nThe specific design of UBI significantly impacts the distribution of winners and losers, and increases or decreases in poverty amongst different groups. Some proposals result in higher poverty for some groups than under the current social security system. One version with UBI payments based mainly on current benefit levels (funded by increasing tax rates by three percentage points and abolishing the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance thresholds) would reduce poverty overall but lead to higher poverty rates for children and lone parents. Around 20% of people in the poorest fifth would lose more than 5% of their income (despite the scheme being highly redistributive overall).\nOther proposals avoid big losses for people on low incomes. Malcolm Torry proposed a UBI payment of £60 per week, funded by raising the basic, higher and top rates of tax by two, three and four percentage points respectively (and substantially reducing – though not eliminating - the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance threshold). This reduces the number of people in poverty by 16% and children in poverty by 13%, while fewer than 2% of the poorest fifth of households lose more than 5% of their income. Compass proposed a scheme that reduces working-age poverty by a fifth and child poverty by a third, with only around 1% of people in the bottom fifth losing more than 5% of their income. It raises existing tax rates by three percentage points, abolishes the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance thresholds, and introduces a starter tax rate of 15% on the first £11,850 of earnings. However, that leaves a funding gap of £28 billion.\nThese models provide only illustrative examples of how UBI might be funded by income tax. In reality, such radical changes might require a more balanced tax response (such as wealth or carbon taxes) but there is no doubt that significant tax rises would be necessary.\nWould giving people an income regardless of work lead to many more people deciding not to take paid employment, valuing the unpaid work of carers and contributions to society other than paid jobs? If so, would that damage or improve our economy and society? Alternatively, UBI could increase work incentives by reducing the rate at which income from it was reduced as someone earned more. For example, Universal Credit is reduced by 63p in every pound earned above a set level; under some versions of UBI this would change to someone losing only 20p for every pound earned.\nEconomic models estimate employment effects purely through a financial lens. Work incentives are calculated according to the net financial gain from taking a job or increasing earnings. Most modelling suggests that UBI (accompanied by higher taxes on earnings to pay for it) would have a complex mix of impacts. Some groups see increased work incentives because their benefits are reduced by less as they move into work or earn more. Others have lower work incentives due to unearned income and higher tax rates. Under the version of UBI modelled by Fraser of Allander et al, the overall result was that UBI reduced financial incentives to work and so could lead to a lower labour supply and a smaller economy. By contrast, Martinelli and Pearce found that several UBI schemes strengthened work incentives on average for low- and middle-income households.\nA change on the scale of UBI would be likely to affect other aspects of our economy, for instance how wages were set. It is hard to predict how individuals and businesses might react to such changes. In addition, in the real world we don’t make decisions purely on the basis assumed in economic modelling. There is limited evidence about how people respond to UBI in practice. So far, trials suggest that providing an unconditional payment may not have the negative employment effects found in some modelling. Finland is the only country to have carried out a nationwide, randomised control trial of UBI. The evaluation found that people receiving basic income were more likely to be in work than those in the control group. This is not conclusive, due to the introduction of other unemployment policies at the same time, although the signs from other smaller trials have also been positive, such as those in Stockton (USA) and the Netherlands . However, these trials have not examined the potential employment effects of changes to tax rates or other measures to fund such a system.\nOne of the potential benefits of UBI is the removal of stress caused by means-tests, conditionality and uncertainty about whether support will be withdrawn, coupled with destigmatisation of social security support. This could lead to better mental and physical health. It is easy to see the well-being advantages of a system providing a reliable income, uncoupled from complex conditions, shorn of the fear of failing and the feeling of being seen as a scrounger or having to continually prove your eligibility. The limited evidence from trials backs up this theory. In Finland, people on basic income reported higher life satisfaction, better health and lower levels of depression and loneliness.\nSome versions of UBI could reduce poverty and improve recipients’ mental health and well-being. But it would be expensive. It would require significant increases in tax rates, which people may be reluctant to accept, even if many of those on low- to middle-incomes would be better off overall once receipt of their UBI payment is accounted for. The principle of offering payments without conditions might well also meet resistance among the public.\nPublic attitudes towards welfare have been softening in recent years , with increasing support for raising benefit levels. There has also been rising willingness to pay more tax to fund more public spending. However, when asked what kind of public spending additional taxes should be spent on , very few people prioritise social security. When asked directly about UBI, some studies show a sizeable minority of the public are receptive to the idea, at least of a pilot, but with no majority in favour and significant concerns about cost and use of the money, even among supporters; other studies suggest around half may be in favour. JRF polling in Scotland found a majority in favour of the Minimum Income Guarantee and significant minorities receptive to the idea of UBI, but no majority for that, or for increasing unemployment benefits. Willingness to personally pay more tax to fund UBI may well also be much lower than such polling implies. YouGov polling in 2020 examined whether the British public would be willing to pay more in tax to deal with the costs of the pandemic. It found that the public did support tax rises, but not for themselves. Only a quarter would back a tax rise that affected everyone.\nA second barrier to introducing UBI nationally is the potential complexity and disruption of introducing large-scale changes to the social security and tax systems. The roll-out of Universal Credit has shown just how challenging such a change can be, for claimants, staff and civil society. Many of those who rely on social security feel extremely fearful about transferring from one benefit to another, or from one system to another. The extent of potential disruption does depend on the details of the scheme. The addition of a small simple new universal payment while maintaining the rest of the existing benefit system around it might be less challenging.\nIt is undoubtedly true that our social security system is failing to protect people from destitution and hardship. We need better coverage and to invest more in the system. But a multitude of changes to the existing system would go a long way to achieving those goals, without the expense and disruption of a new system. We could remove the benefit cap, the two-child limit and the five-week wait; extend sick pay to all; boost support for those at most risk of poverty; run national take up campaigns and reform council tax. A range of other measures, such as these , could be taken to fulfil other goals or principles of UBI. None of these individual changes would eradicate poverty, as a generous UBI system would. They would all require money and political will. But pursuing such improvements could transform the system for a fraction of the cost and difficulty of that kind associated with UBI.\nOur current system fails to ensure that all those within it are treated with dignity and respect. It causes unnecessary and harmful stress for too many people and the sanctions regime is unnecessarily punitive. Again, however, we could roll back the complexity and harshness of conditionality and refocus the current system on maximising take up, valuing caring and supporting people to move into high-quality work.\nChanging the public and media narrative is necessary to achieving greater and more sustainable investment in our social security system, whether that is to improve the existing system or put a new UBI in place. The question is whether couching the debate in terms of introducing UBI will be more or less effective in building that support compared to focusing more specifically on the different elements that are needed, such as greater understanding of the purpose of social security, greater empathy for those relying on it, the need for adequate support and dignity.\nAnd what about the underlying issue of insecurity in work (and housing for that matter)? Our social security system needs to do more to counter the volatility in earned income that many low-earning workers face. For some, Universal Credit is exaggerating that volatility rather than counterbalancing it. This is a difficult policy challenge, but UBI is not the only way to solve it. Smaller changes could achieve significant improvements such as strengthening more universal elements of the system (like Child Benefit) and contributory benefits; more infrequent reassessments of eligibility for some benefits; run-ons when circumstances change, and disregard when incomes rise or fall by small amounts. Clearer incentives to move into work and increase earnings could be achieved by allowing people to earn more before they started to lose benefits and reducing the ‘taper rate’ so benefits reduce more slowly. All of these would require additional investment, so the argument about funding still needs to be won, but they would probably be less expensive and might be less challenging to achieve than UBI.\nAddressing insecurity also requires wider changes to our economy and society – no social security system can or should do the whole job. We must redesign the labour market to offer greater security as well as better pay, training and treatment at work. We need more low-cost rented homes and better rights for private sector renters so that people on low incomes can be freed from the constant fear of homelessness.\nUBI is not a silver bullet that would immediately and straightforwardly solve poverty. It could not replace the whole social security system. It is beyond doubt that a UBI that radically reduced poverty levels would require enormous increases in public spending and be a very significant redistribution across society. A smaller, less radical but potentially more immediately achievable, partial UBI payment could achieve some valuable outcomes but would fall short of some of the bigger aims of UBI. There are more targeted ways of achieving similar outcomes, although these might not bring some of the wider impacts of a very generous UBI.\nThe debate about ambitious interventions to reduce poverty is welcome, underlining the growing consensus that the current social security system is inadequate and does not provide the effective public service we need to protect people from poverty. A social security system that provides adequate support, reduces poverty and removes the indignities and stigma associated with the present system is a vital part of ending the injustice of poverty in the UK. A Minimum Income Guarantee could provide a positive framework within which to make progress. Whatever form it takes, it will require significant investment, for which we must build public support.\n*The Minimum Income Standard (MIS) is funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and carried out by Loughborough University. It involves research which produces budgets for different household types, based on what members of the public think you need for a minimum acceptable standard of living in the UK."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "There is debate over whether the US Federal Reserve should be abolished.", "reference_documents": ["How Do We Eliminate Inflation and the Boom-Bust Cycle?\nAfter 80-plus years of inflation and devastating booms and busts, how do we get rid of the cause of these economic cancers? “The only way to do that is to abolish legalized counterfeiting: that is, to abolish the Federal Reserve System, and return to the gold standard,” answers Murray Rothbard in his book The Case Against the Fed .\nFor students who did not have the opportunity to take United States Economic History from the late Dr. Rothbard, this slim volume will give you an idea of what his classes were like.\nDr. Rothbard never bored his students with sterile graphs or convoluted equations. Neither does this book. This story of the Federal Reserve is about good guys, bad guys, and self-serving politicians helping their rich and famous friends. Also interesting is Rothbard’s discussion of nineteenth-century British case law that paved the way for fractional reserve banking. Rothbard points out that, with bailment law undeveloped in the nineteenth century, bankers were able to win three important court cases culminating with the Foley v. Hill and Others case in 1848. In this case, the House of Lords decided that bankers contract for an amount of money, but not necessarily to keep that particular money on hand.\nRothbard lays to rest the myth that the Panic of 1907 led to the creation of the Fed. Bankers began scheming for a central bank after William McKinley defeated William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election. Long gone were the days of the hard-money Jacksonian Democratic party, and the populist Democrat Bryan pushed for monetizing silver to increase the supply of money. Wall Street’s bankers supported McKinley, not wanting inflation that they couldn’t control.\nThe Panic of 1907 was used to whip up support for a central bank. But, it was the meetings of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention that started the political wheels turning, culminating in the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in December of 1913.\nWith the system in place, all that was needed was the “right” man to control the money machine. In 1914, that man was Benjamin Strong, then president of J. P. Morgan-owned Bankers Trust and best friend of Morgan partners Harry P. Davison, Dwight Morrow, and Thomas W. Lamont.\nStrong ruled the Fed until his death in 1928. During World War I, he engineered a doubling of the supply of money, financing the U.S. war effort.\nThe continuous Fed propaganda is that a zealous public clamors for more inflation, and only the Federal Reserve’s cool heads are standing in the way of a hyper-inflation armageddon. Of course, just the opposite is true. As Rothbard points out, “The culprit solely responsible for inflation, the Federal Reserve, is continually engaged in raising a hue-and-cry about `inflation,’ for which virtually everyone else in society seems to be responsible. What we are seeing is the old ploy by the robber who starts shouting `Stop, thief!’ and runs down the street pointing ahead at others.”\nRothbard saves the fun part of dismantling the Fed for last. Liberty lovers are always being told that, “your ideas sound good, but how are you going to get there from here?” Rothbard has given us simple directions for the Fed’s liquidation.\nWith the Fed abolished, banks would be on their own; no more lender of last resort, or taxpayer bailouts. The inflation dragon would be slain. The boom-and-bust roller coaster ride leveled.\nThe Case Against the Fed is part history, part polemic, and part policy paper, succeeding with all three. Murray Rothbard has written another classic. []\nMr. French is a vice president in commercial real estate lending for a bank in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nBased on the following credentials, which of these two very real (but now deceased) people do you think would be most likely to excel in “urban planning,” the practice of designing and developing land use, transportation, infrastructure, and other important elements of the building and management of cities?\nPerson A earned an undergraduate degree from Yale and another from Wadham College, a master’s degree from Wadham, and a doctorate from Columbia University. From there, this person went on to hold more positions within the government of a major American metropolis than perhaps any other in its history—supervising everything from parks to architecture to roads and bridges.\nPerson B earned just one degree, a high school diploma, and that’s it. Never held a position within any city government, anywhere.\nIf you chose Person A, you might need to brush up on your F. A. Hayek. The famed Austrian School economist and Nobel laureate once cogently advised,\nThe curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralizing decisions and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralization actually leads to more information being taken into account.\nUniversity degrees are still a kind of “union card” for employment in some places. Perhaps they are a rough measure of information in one’s head, but information should not be confused with wisdom . It was with good reason, after all, that William F. Buckley once noted that he would “rather live in a society governed by the first two thousand names in the Boston telephone directory than in a society governed by the two thousand faculty members of Harvard University . ”\nPerson A in my paradigm was Robert Moses (1888-1981), who wielded immense authority as an unelected New York City “planner” for decades, and under administrations of both Democrat and Republican mayors. He is a perfect example of how power corrupts, for the longer he hung around, the more dismissive he was of dissenting opinions.\nHis “renewal” projects were punctuated with arrogance. When he used the city’s eminent domain powers to wipe out whole neighborhoods, he spoke derisively of the citizens whose property he bulldozed. The “city” in his mind was not composed of its living residents so much as the concrete structures he envisioned in their place. The residents were the city’s “jungles” that he would use city government to “clear out” and cleanse.\nPerson B in my paradigm was Jane Jacobs (1916-2006), a heroine of urban culture if ever there was one. Incredibly intuitive and observant, as well as courageously outspoken, she knew cities from the bottom up. Whereas the “well-educated” Robert Moses looked down on cities from above and saw jungle, Jacobs proved in her principled opposition to his grandiose plans that, in her words, “The real jungle is in the office of the bureaucrats.”\nToday—May 4, 2023—marks the 107th anniversary of the birth of the remarkable Jane Jacobs. No one is an expert on cities if he isn’t well aware of what she believed, what she wrote, and what she did.\nCitizen Jane: Battle for the City is a remarkable documentary video I encourage readers to watch. One of the many people interviewed in it neatly summarizes what Jacobs was all about:\nNever mind high-falutin’ theories and so forth. What are we looking at? What are we seeing? Do you want to trust some theory that somebody figured out sitting in an office somewhere, or do you want to trust what you actually see out there with your own eyes? Maybe the experts didn’t really know as much as they pretended to know.\nAt the height of his power and influence, Robert Moses ripped at the heart of New York City’s vibrant and often ethnic enclaves. He devastated colorful street and sidewalk culture and erected lifeless hi-rise public housing in its place (which even its residents resented). He loved his bulldozers but Jacobs preferred people.\nIn one of the many public protests she helped organize, Jacobs wore a placard around her neck adorned in large letters with the message, “Conscience: the Ultimate Weapon!”\nProfessionally, Jacobs was a journalist. Her competence derived not from any university degrees she bought, but from her street-savvy understanding of people and city life. She proved to be a brilliant strategist in taking on Moses when she led citizens in killing his plans to build a road through a beloved city park. When he proposed to construct an expressway across Lower Manhattan, forever blighting life in Greenwich Village and Soho, Jane Jacobs played the role of David to Moses’ Goliath. It’s an inspiring story of grassroots opposition that ultimately proved the emperor had no clothes.\nIn the name of “urban renewal” and with the political pomp of its ribbon-cutting ceremonies, Jacobs implored us to examine the actual results of government bullies like Robert Moses:\nLook what we have built…Low-income projects that become worse centers of delinquency, vandalism, and general social hopelessness than the slums they were supposed to replace. Middle-income housing projects which are truly models of dullness and regimentation, sealed against any buoyancy or vitality of city life. Luxury housing projects that mitigate their inanity, or try to, with a vapid vulgarity. Cultural centers that are unable to support a good bookstore. Civic centers that are avoided by everyone but bums…Expressways that eviscerate great cities. This is not the rebuilding of cities. This is the sacking of cities.\nMy purpose in this essay is not to recount the famous battles between Jacobs and Moses in detail, but rather to mark her birthday with some of her most memorable insights and to encourage readers to look at her classic book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities . In the recommended readings below, you’ll also find some excellent articles about her.\nI hope these selected Jacobs quotes will inspire many new readers of her work:\n\"There is nothing more inert than a government bureau. There is nothing more inert than a planning office. It gets going in one direction and it’s never going to change of its own accord…The citizens are going to have to frustrate the planners. I thereupon began to devote myself to frustrating planners, and so did the whole neighborhood.\"\n_____\n\"I was brought up to believe that there is no virtue in conforming meekly to the dominant opinion of the moment. I was encouraged to believe that simple conformity results in stagnation for a society, and that American progress has been largely owing to the opportunity for experimentation, the leeway given initiative, and to a gusto and a freedom for chewing over odd ideas.\"\n_____\n\"I was taught that the American’s right to be a free individual, not at the mercy of the state, was hard-won and that its price was eternal vigilance, that I too would have to be vigilant. I was made to feel that it would be a disgrace to me, as an individual, if I should not value or should give up rights that were dearly bought. I am grateful for that upbringing.\"\n_____\n\"Extremists typically want to squash not only those who disagree with them diametrically, but those who disagree with them at all. It seems to me that in every country where extremists of the left have gotten sufficiently in the saddle to squash the extremists of the right, they have ridden on to squash the center or terrorize it also. And the same goes for extremists of the right. I do not want that to happen in our country.\"\n_____\n\"Advanced cultures are usually sophisticated enough or have been sophisticated enough at some point in their pasts, to realize that foxes shouldn’t be relied on to guard henhouses.\"\n_____\n\"There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder, and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.\"\n_____\n\"The pseudoscience of planning seems almost neurotic in its determination to imitate empiric failure and ignore empiric success.\"\n_____\n\"The trouble with paternalists is that they want to make impossibly profound changes, and they choose impossibly superficial means for doing so.\"\n_____\n\"The first thing to understand is that the public peace—the sidewalk and street peace—of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves…No amount of police can enforce civilization where the normal, casual enforcement of it has broken down.\"\n_____\n\"To see complex systems of functional order as order and not as chaos takes understanding. The leaves dropping from the trees in the autumn, the interior of an airplane engine, the entrails of a dissected rabbit, the city desks of a newspaper—all appear to be chaos, but they are seen without comprehension. Once they are seen as systems of order, they actually look different.\"\n_____\n\"Historically, solutions to city problems have very seldom come from the top. They come from people who understand the problems firsthand because they’re living with them and have new and ingenious and often very off-beat ideas of how to solve them.\"\n_____\n\"Under the seeming disorder of the old [pre-“urban renewal’] city…is a marvelous order for maintaining the safety of the street and the freedom of the city. It is a complex order. This order is all composed of movement and change and although it is life, not art, we may fancifully call it the art form of the city, and liken it to the dance—not to a simple-minded precision dance with everyone kicking up at the same time, twirling in unison and bowing en masse, but to an intricate ballet in which the individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole.\""], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "It can be traced back to the **Book of Common Prayer**, by **Thomas Cranmer**, Archbishop of Canterbury.", "reference_documents": ["Updated\nDid you know that weddings are one of the oldest recorded traditions? Ancient documents for marriage agreements have been found in every culture and continent and go back to when contracts were etched into stone! However, it wasn’t until relatively recently that the phrase “until death do us part” was used.\nEven today, marriage is generally undertaken as a lifelong commitment to another person. The universal hope when starting out in married life is that the union will end only by death. Read on to learn more about “until death do us part” meaning.\nThe phrase “until death do us part” means death should be the only thing that will separate the married couple for their whole lives. At times, a euphemism for death might be substituted instead, like “until the Lord takes us home.”\nThough this common phrase doesn’t mean that the couple can’t separate if they want to later on, it’s used to emphasize the importance of trying to make a marriage work to the best of your ability.\nThis phrase is also an important part of the ceremony due to the emphasis that parting in marriage should only be for serious matters, not trivial ones.\nThe origin of the phrase “until death do us part” is uniquely Christian and dates back to 1549 where it is found in “The Book of Common Prayer.” The original phrase was slightly different and read “till death us depart.”\nThe phrase underwent slight variations further down through the years as language evolved and eventually became “till death we do part” in the 1662 version of “The Book of Common Prayer.” Later on, the “do” and “us” were switched and the phrase has remained the same to this day.\nOriginally, the phrase didn’t start as a way to emphasize the importance of making a marriage work out. Instead, it was quite literally a decree that a husband and wife could not be separated for any reason other than death. For Catholics, divorce has historically been unacceptable for any reason except for death.\nEven today, the Catholic Church does not recognize divorce. Societal norms, however, have adjusted and divorce is now a much more acceptable part of life. In light of changing views on marriage, the phrase has now become a customary phrase uttered in Christian and non-Christian weddings, even if religion doesn’t factor into the practice of the couple’s daily lives.\nAs the world has become more modern in social and moral values, the traditional phrase has found its way into pop culture and can be seen everywhere from songs and movies to sitcoms and Broadway plays.\nWhile the majority of movies with wedding scenes use the popular phrase, two movies use the phrase as the title itself — but it may not be for the reason you expect.\nThis Australian movie used the famous phrase as the title but certainly not in the context you’d imagine.\nThe use of the phrase was rather ironic since the plot of the movie was about an Italian man falling in love with a gangster’s wife who found out and set out to kill his wife’s lover to make them part ways.\nThe phrase was used a second time for the title of a movie in 2017 to address the seriousness of abuse in marriage.\nIn the movie, a happy marriage becomes toxic and the husband becomes completely controlling. The wife is able to escape the marriage only to be found again by the husband.\nThese songs highlight the lifelong commitment of marriage and are appropriately named 'Till Death Do Us Part.'\nWhite Lion was a Danish/American rock band popular in the 1980s and 1990s. The band had a short run but this song was a hit and is used in weddings and romance mixed tapes everywhere.\nLyrics that highlight the forever nature of marriage include, “All through your life, I’ll be by your side. Till death do us part, I’ll be your friend” and, “My love will never end, till death do us part. When I wake up every day, with you lying in my arms.”\nAn up-and-coming artist who did well on “The Voice,” Brian Nhira penned a love song so beautiful that it can be used in weddings everywhere. The song is filled with sentiments about the lifelong nature of marriage as seen in lines such as, “You’re the one I wanna dance with for the rest of my life. You’re the one I wanna hold and never let go. I need your love till death do us part.”\nMuch of Nhira’s work revolves around love and relationships. In another marriage-focused piece, he asks his wife-to-be if she will still love him when he is old and gray or if their health should fail.\nThrough the message of the song and music video that accompanies it, he shows him and his wife making a lifelong commitment. He makes it clear that because of the “till death do us part” nature of marriage, leaving is not considered an option. Instead, his song encourages married couples to be there for someone when they go through a difficult time instead of thinking of leaving them to face it alone.\nEven popular household sitcoms have used this phrase, both explicitly and implicitly.\nTill Death Do Us Part aired as a sitcom on British TV that lasted from 1965 to 1975. The sitcom was based on a father and his son-in-law constantly coming to blows as a result of their differing political views.\nSequels of the show were made under slightly different names until the late 1990s. By then, the characters and the title had become a household topic of conversation in Britain from one end of the country to the other.\nThere may be no other show with more recognizable wedding scenes than the show F.R.I.E.N.D.S . Throughout the life of the sitcom, the characters married, divorced, and married again.\nFirst, during Monica and Chandler’s wedding, Chandler tells Monica, “You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with.”\nThe scene repeats itself during Mike and Phoebe’s wedding. Mike says, “I can’t wait to share my life with you forever.” Though they didn’t use the exact phrase, the implied meaning is the same — they hope to remain married until death parts them.\nEveryone stands at the altar ready to embark upon what they hope will be a lifelong marriage adventure. However, divorce occurs for a number of reasons, including the stress of deployment, differences in outlook on life, or irreconcilable differences.\nThe good news is that for those who want to make it work, you can find solutions for each of these problems. For some couples, it might be as simple as learning how to stay connected or how to care for someone from far away .\nMany marriages will survive the stress, pressure, and turmoil of life. But even the closest of marriages will eventually experience the death of a partner. As unthinkable as separation from a spouse may seem, one way to stay connected to each other after one passes away is by continuing to wear the symbol of your commitment — your wedding ring.\nMany people feel unsure of what to do with wedding rings after a death . The simple answer is that there’s no reason why you should stop wearing it if you want to keep it on. Even after death parts you from your spouse, wearing the symbol of your abiding love might help you to keep your spouse near.\nSources\n- The Book of Common Prayer, New York, 1789. justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1789/Marriage_1789.htm\n- F.R.I.E.N.D.S Vows, Youtube, Uploaded by Lorem Ipsum, 29 Jan.2012. youtube.com/watch?v=M9gWyGoYoAo\n- American Til Death Do Us Part, Youtube, Uploaded by Youtube Movies, 10 Dec. 2018. youtube.com/watch?v=i4-8tJQYbHk\n- Australian Til Death Do Us Part, Internet Movie Database, 1 Sept. 2008. imdb.com/title/tt2326395/\n- Till Death Do Us Part, Youtube, Uploaded by Brian Nihra Music, 16 Sept. 2018. youtube.com/watch?v=rbj72Ld5H-w\n- Till Death Do Us Part, Youtube, Uploaded by White Lion, 22 Jan. 2011. youtube.com/watch?v=NU1zUBDQMz0"], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

O. , 469 U.S. 325 (1985), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which established the standards by which a public school official can search a student in a school environment without a search warrant , and to what extent.\nThe case centered around a student at Piscataway High School in Middlesex County, New Jersey , known then only by her initials T. L. O. , [a] who was searched for contraband after she was caught smoking in a school bathroom. She was sent to the principal's office, where the vice principal searched her purse and found marijuana , drug paraphernalia , and documentation of drug sales. She was expelled from the school and charged by police for the paraphernalia found in the search, but fought the charges on the basis that the search of her purse violated the Fourth Amendment 's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure .\nThe New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the constitutionality of the search, but the Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed, holding that the search of her purse was unreasonable. On appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school officials in a school setting. However, school officials do not need to have probable cause nor obtain a warrant before searching a student. Instead, in order for a search to be justified, school officials must have \" reasonable suspicion \" that the student has violated either the law or school rules. In a 6–3 decision delivered by Justice Byron White , the Court ruled that the school's search of T. L. O.'s purse was constitutional, setting a new precedent for school searches and student privacy.\nOn March 7, 1980, a teacher at Piscataway High School in Piscataway, New Jersey discovered two 14-year-old freshmen smoking in the girl's bathroom, in violation of school rules. [1] While students were permitted to smoke in designated smoking areas, the bathroom was not one of them. [3] The two were sent to principal's office, where they were questioned by vice principal Theodore Choplick. One of the students admitted to smoking and was assigned to complete a three-day smoking clinic before being sent back to class. [4] The other student, whose initials were T. L. O. , denied ever having smoked in her life. [5]\nChoplick brought T. L. O. into his private office and demanded to see her purse. [b] Upon searching it, Choplick found a pack of Marlboro cigarettes and rolling paper in plain view . [10] These findings prompted Choplick to conduct a more thorough search of T. L. O.'s purse, revealing a small amount of marijuana , a tobacco pipe , an index card with the names of students who owed her money, and two letters linking her to dealing marijuana. [11] Choplick notified the police and T. L. O.'s mother, who both arrived at the school shortly after. [11] A police officer requested for T. L. O. to be brought to the police station for questioning, and T. L. O.'s mother drove her from the school to the police station. [4] During questioning, T. L. O. admitted to selling marijuana on school property. [12]\nShe was convicted of dealing and use of illicit drugs. She was expelled from the school and fined $1,000. She was charged as a juvenile for the drugs and paraphernalia found in the search.\nOral arguments were initially heard on March 28, 1984. A rehearing was ordered by the Court and the case was reargued on October 2, 1984. The Supreme Court of the United States , in a 6–3 decision issued by Justice Byron White , balancing between the legitimate expectation of privacy of the individual, even a child, and the school's interest in maintaining order and discipline, held for the appellant (the state). [13] According to school officials, they do require a \" reasonable suspicion \" to perform a search.\nHer possession of any cigarettes was relevant to whether or not she was being truthful, and since she had been caught in the bathroom and taken directly to the office, it was reasonable to assume she had the cigarettes in her purse. Thus, the vice-principal had reasonable cause to suspect a school rule had been broken, and more than just a \"hunch\" to search the purse. When the vice-principal was searching for the cigarettes, the drug-related evidence was in plain view. Plain view is an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the reasonable search for cigarettes led to some of the drug related material being discovered, which justified a search (including the zippered compartments inside the bag) resulting in the discovery of the cigarettes and other evidence including a small bag of marijuana and cigarette rolling papers.\nIn a separate concurring opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. (joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor ) stated that while he agreed with the Court's opinion, he felt that students in primary and secondary educational settings should not be afforded the same level of protection for search and seizures as adults and juveniles in non-school settings. [14]\nJustice William J. Brennan , joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall , agreed with the majority's conclusions about the applicability of the Fourth Amendment to school teachers but dissented from the new standard set down by the Court, which he felt was a departure from the traditional \" probable cause \" approach.\nToday's decision sanctions school officials to conduct full scale searches on a 'reasonableness' standard whose only definite content is that it is not the same test as the 'probable cause' standard found in the text of the Fourth Amendment. In adopting this unclear, unprecedented, and unnecessary departure from generally Fourth Amendment standards, the Court carves out a broad exception to standards that this Court has developed over years of considering Fourth Amendment problems. Its decision is supported neither by precedent nor even by a fair application of the 'Balancing test of power' it proclaims in this very opinion. [15]\nBrennan went on to argue that for the government to justify a warrantless search , some \"special governmental interest\" outside of standard law enforcement interests was required. This idea was later adopted by the Court as the special needs exception . [16]"], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The album was released to much anticipation and the single \"Rehab\" was a hauntingly ironic, upbeat tune where Winehouse refused to go to a rehabilitation centre to manage her drug and alcohol problem.", "reference_documents": ["ADVERTISEMENT\nAlthough the album’s biggest hit was the infectious “Rehab,” about Winehouse’s real-life battle with addiction, arguably its cornerstone was its title song, a cathartic symphony of sadness written by the singer together with Mark Ronson, the London-born US producer who helmed six of Back To Black ‘s eleven songs.\nUsing the word “black” as a metaphor for the abyss of depression, “Back To Black” is a bleak, grief-stricken portrait of heartbreak purportedly inspired by Winehouse’s ex-boyfriend’s infidelity. Mournful strings and an ominous tolling bell create a funereal atmosphere, which is dramatically juxtaposed with a danceable, retro-slanted musical backdrop inspired by 60s girl-group pop and Phil Spector’s wall of sound production values.\n“Back To Black” was the first song Winehouse wrote and recorded for her second album. It came about in March 2006 when she was persuaded to meet Mark Ronson in the producer’s Greenwich Village recording studio. On her arrival there, she mistook Ronson for a recording engineer and, according to her father Mitch in his 2012 book, Amy, My Daughter , thought the producer would be “an older Jewish guy with a big beard.” Nevertheless, the two talked, bonded through their love of music, and the next day, Ronson had written the beginning of a song for her, as he recalled to MOJO in 2010: “I came up with this little piano riff, which became the verse chords to ‘Back To Black.’ Behind it, I just put a kick drum and a tambourine and tons of reverb.”\nWinehouse was thrilled with Ronson’s idea; she quickly wrote some lyrics based on what she was going through at the time and then they recorded a demo of the song. They then cut it with a rhythm section in Brooklyn at The House Of Soul, a studio run by Daptone, an indie label specializing in retro soul and funk. Additional recording later took place at Chung King Studios in New York and Metropolis in London, where Winehouse and Ronson finessed the song with production touches that deepened the song’s sable colors.\nAmy Winehouse - Back To Black\nClick to load video\nAfter the unveiling of Back To Black in October 2006, Amy Winehouse’s name was on everyone’s lips. The LP quickly went multi-platinum around the world and transformed its creator into a global phenomenon. Its title song was released as the set’s third single in April 2007, initially rising to 25 in the UK; ironically, a month later, Winehouse married Blake Fielder-Civil, whose actions had inspired the song. After Winehouse’s tragic death in 2011, “Back To Black” got a second lease of life, peaking at No. 8 in the UK singles chart and eventually going platinum.\nSince then, “Black To Black” has spawned several cover versions; the most notable by Beyoncé and André 3000, who joined forces in 2013 to record a slowed-down rendition for The Great Gatsby soundtrack. Other versions have come from the UK singer Lightspeed Champion, who re-modeled the tune as a folk-inspired acoustic number in 2008, and French chanteuse Amanda Lear, who infused it with a jazzy, late-night vibe. Immediately after Winehouse’s death in 2011, ex-Ronette Ronnie Spector – said to have been a formative influence on the Camden singer – paid tribute to Winehouse by releasing a disco treatment of “Back To Black” as a single.\nNothing seems to encapsulate Amy Winehouse’s unique musical persona and sound quite like the song “Back To Black.” Considered one of her signature songs, its stature has grown immeasurably since the singer’s passing, perhaps because of the poignancy and prescience of the lines: “I tread a troubled track, My odds are stacked.” Indeed, it was the raw realism and authentically autobiographical nature of her songs that made Amy Winehouse’s music so compelling. And “Back To Black,” with its timeless story of betrayal and love gone bad, has a universality that resonates deeply with anyone who’s ever suffered rejection and a broken heart."], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

They do this in two ways. The first is with anatomical specializations that enable the eyes to rotate with a high degree of freedom. The second is the chameleon’s ability to transition between monocular and binocular vision, meaning they can view objects with either eye independently, or with both eyes together.\nSeveral anatomical features enable chameleons to rotate their eyes to such a high degree. The eyes are located on opposite sides of the head, providing a view to the sides and behind or toward the front. Internally, the eye balls are mounted in twin conical turrets (like two upside down ice cream cones). Without a deep orbital socket to keep the eye from falling out (as in humans), the chameleon has evolved a thick, muscular lid. This lid surrounds each eye turret, leaving only the pupil exposed. This provides a “safety net” that enables the eye to bulge out of the conical turret. Without the restriction of a deep orbital socket, each eye can rotate nearly 180 degrees, giving a much wider range of vision than animals whose eyes are secured in socket structures.\nPermission provided by Tanalahy.com for use on AskNature.org.\nThe ability to transition between monocular and binocular vision also enables the chameleon to view objects panoramically. While searching for prey, the chameleon uses monocular vision, with each eye functioning independently of the other. The eye movements–or saccades–are referred to as ‘uncoupled’ when functioning this way. Two separate bundles of nerves control the musculature of the eyes, and two separate images are sent to the brain. Once the chameleon spots its prey, the saccades synchronize, in a process called “coupling,” and both eyes lock on the object. For coupling to occur, visual signals are first sent to the brain through two non-coupled neural bundles. The brain reads these signals, and the eye that has spotted the prey sends stronger electrical impulses to the brain than the eye still searching for the target. The neuron from the eye that does not see the prey syncs with the one that does, forming a larger neural bundle. Once the eye movements are synchronized, the eyes fix on the object and only the head rotates.\nThe chameleon’s ability to switch freely between synchronous and uncoupled saccadic eye movement is like having two movies playing in your head, and if you wanted to only watch one, you could. This enables the chameleon to operate as both a binocular and monocular organism in a remarkably efficient way for protection, food gathering, and reflexes.\nThis summary was contributed by Allie Miller."], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

As a result, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is much higher today than it was before the 1980s.\nBeing overweight or obese can contribute to health problems, including an increased risk for many of the chronic diseases that plague Americans. Learn more about the average weight in America in this post.\nRecent data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) suggests that the average weight of men in the US is 199.8 pounds. The average weight for women is 170.8 pounds.\nTo put this in perspective, it’s important to consider body mass index (BMI) . BMI, or weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, is often used to measure overweight and obesity.\nHere are the ranges of BMI:\n· 18.5 to 24.9: normal weight\n· 25 to 29.9: overweight\n· 30+: obesity\nBased on BMI, more than 70% of US adults are considered overweight or obese. The average BMI in the US is 26.6 for adult men and 26.5 for adult women.\nStarting in the 1980s, there has been a steady increase in the percent of adults who are overweight or obese. The percent of men with obesity jumped from 13 to 21 percent between 1980 and 1991, while the percent of women with obesity jumped from 17 to 26 percent. This trend has continued for 30 years into the current decade.\nBeing overweight or obese is a risk factor for certain health issues. Compared to those with a normal weight, people who are overweight or obese are at a greater risk of developing the following conditions:\n· High blood pressure\n· Type 2 diabetes\n· Heart disease\n· Stroke\n· Liver disease\n· Sleep apnea\n· Certain types of cancer, including endometrial, liver, kidney, pancreatic, and colon cancer\n· Arthritis and joint pain\n· Depression and anxiety\nThere may be a variety of mechanisms through which excess fat contributes to disease development. For example, fat cells secrete substances that contribute to chronic inflammation, a state that is associated with certain diseases. Having too much fat may also impact insulin resistance, blood lipid levels, blood pressure, reproduction, and other bodily processes.\nConsidering that the majority of American adults are overweight or obese, and that excess weight is linked to many health problems, maintaining a healthy weight is incredibly important.\nWhile some people believe that you need to lose all of your excess weight to reap benefits, research suggests otherwise. Losing just 5% of total body weight can be very beneficial for those who are overweight or obese and can help prevent associated health problems.\nMaking diet and lifestyle changes, like implementing meal prep or signing up for a healthy meal delivery service, can be helpful for losing weight.

Read on and I'll explain the details, and there's a number of them.\n\"You can't eat any wild mushrooms raw\" is the mantra of plenty of mushroom clubs and mushroom hunters around the United States, and although I don't like engaging in online debates too much, ( I know I'll get a few emails after I post this ) the \"can you eat mushrooms raw\" question is one that I will debate on all day.\nIt's an issue that a number of wild mushroom hunters I know have a particular zeal for, and, like all good debatable things, is not a simple yes or no question. I'm going to do my best to explain why you can eat some wild mushrooms raw and how to go about it safely, if it interests you.\nI'd say 99% of edible wild mushrooms shouldn't be eaten raw, but the one percent left over are exciting, delicious, and are worth seeking out.\nThere's a catch though, and it's a big one. The catch, is that the vast majority of edible wild mushrooms should not be eaten raw. Period.\nHeck, I'd say 99.% of wild mushrooms shouldn't be eaten raw. First, I think it's useful to address and consider the obvious, that most people in America will have, at least at one point in time, have gone to a salad bar and seen the ubiquitous, sliced, raw button mushrooms sitting next to the black olives and yellow banana peppers.\nBut, there's a big difference between those raw, sad white mushrooms from the salad bar, and wild mushrooms. Edible wild mushrooms can be any number of different species, all with different shapes, sizes, aromas, and, even toxic properties.\nThere's numerous wild mushrooms commonly eaten by hunters like my self that are both edible, and toxic, including, but not limited to: morels and their cousins, Leccinum / scaber stalks, blewits, honey mushrooms, edible amanitas, and I could go on.\nEat those raw, and you can get very sick, some of them could even put you in the hospital. But, if you cook them, the mushrooms are edible, and safe since exposure to high, prolonged heat (or par-blanching in the instance of Amanita muscaria and some Gyromitra ), denatures the problematic compounds, although an unlucky few people have or can develop allergies to them, even after cooking.\nI have one friend, who can't eat morel mushrooms, any morels, if he has alcohol with his meal. I know another friend who only gets sick when he eats a specific type of black morel when consumed with alcohol.\nAnother person I know can't have hedgehog mushrooms, at all, and gets horribly sick from eating them even well cooked. Some people can't have lobster mushrooms, others have their lips tingle and get slightly numb from eating chicken of the woods.\nTo be clear, those sort of individual sensitivities are outliers here, and discussing them is outside the scope of this post.\nSo, the question is, why would, or should you, ever eat a raw mushroom, if you can cook them?\nIn short, because some mushrooms are edible raw, safe to eat, and certain ones are absolutely delicious. There's even some wild mushrooms I prefer not to cook, for the most part (for the record that's beefsteaks and truffles).\nOh, and I would be remiss if I didn't address the chitin digestibility argument here. People love to say \"you cant eat mushrooms raw! Don't you know mushroom tissue is made of chitin--that's like eating crab shells--humans can't digest crabshells!\"\nThe crab argument is partially right, but the small truth that humans can't digest chitin is a moot point, and is really just a phrase that gets parroted from person to person often to bolster their cause, without people thinking critically about it.\nSure, we can't digest crab shells, I get that. Tell me though, when's the last time you saw someone eat a crabshell? Crab shells are spikey, and, not inviting, although they do make delicious stock and compound butter.\nShrimp shells, on the other hand, are also made of chitin, and people do eat those, some with relish, especially when the shrimp have just molted and the shells are very thin.\nI don't eat shrimp shells myself, both since I don't live near the cost and since I usually save them to make stock, but it's a thing.\nSo, why would someone eat a shrimp shell if they can't digest it? Well, big surprise here: people eat shrimp shells because they like the taste, err texture, or maybe both in this case.\nWhat I'm getting at is that humans and other animals commonly eat things that they can't digest for some reason or another. Dogs eat grass for digestive issues, so do cats. People eat all manner of weird shit, in fact, I'd wager humans eat the largest amount of things as a species that we can't digest \"properly\" compared to any other species in the world.\nI mean c'mon, most of us can remember the first time we noticed what happens after we eat an ear of sweet corn! In fact, corn is a great example here.\nHumans don't get much from eating corn, nutritionally speaking. Sweet corn, or corn kernals, have a little (or a lot) of sugar, some fiber, starch, but, not too much else in them.\nCorn is actually deficient of a number of vitamins and minerals, and if we humans eat too much corn, it is a well known fact that we can get something called pellagra, a nutrient deficiency that spread after Europeans brought corn from the New World, around the world.\nGuess what? (Quick aside here) Native Americans didn't got pellagra, they learned eons before that they could derive more nourishment from corn if it underwent a chemical process called nixtamalization, which is how we got tortillas and masa.\nThe point is, millions of people will butter up an ear of corn this summer and not give a thought to if they can \"digest it properly\". The sweet corn-eaters, myself included, eat that buttery steaming ear of indigestible kernals because it tastes good to them.\nAnd that, is about as good of an analogy as I can find for the argument that you can eat some wild mushrooms raw, not care if you digest them \"properly\" and even (gasp!) enjoy them.\nBut, before I tell you about why you might enjoy some select raw favorites, we should mention dosage. The amount of wild mushrooms I'll eat raw is very different from the amounts I'll eat cooked.\nTo put it in perspective, when I do eat wild mushrooms raw, it's generally in small amounts in a salad, or an appetizer, maybe an ounce at the most, typically much less, roughly half and ounce, or even less.\nA little raw shroom can go along way, especially with something as aromatic as matsutake or truffles. By contrast, when I eat cooked mushrooms, I usually consider 2 oz of fresh mushrooms a decent serving.\nNot sold on raw shrooms yet? Don't worry I have more. The next thing that's good to look at, are a few particular mushrooms, and from there, a couple culinary traditions, specifically Italian, French, and Japanese. Here's the big ones that are the best examples I know of (if you know of more, chime in!).\nThese are the mushrooms that come to mind when I think of wild mushrooms I enjoy eating raw, in small amounts, on occasion.\nThis is not a complete list, and even some raw mushroom eaters might disagree with me on black trumpets, but I've been served them multiple times in France, along with golden chanterelles. This list is all mushrooms I have consumed personally, and in more than one case served to others either in restaurants or small gatherings. There's a few notes on each type.\nDating at least back to the Romans, porcini could arguably be the poster child for raw mushroom consumption. Porcini have been eaten for a long time in Italy in their beloved insalata di porcini made of sliced raw mushrooms with parmigiano cheese, olive oil, and hopefully arugula and a good squeeze of lemon, maybe even a few slices of proscuitto.\nIt's a delicious salad—the mushrooms stay crisp and fresh, but have a rich, earthy taste. Every mushroom hunter should try a salad of raw porcini at least once. That being said, you need to know your boletes here , and if you're going to serve someone a raw porcini salad who hasn't had it before, you should be very comfortable with your local species and serve to others only in small amounts.\nMatsutake are loved in Asia, specifically Japan and Korea. Matsutake are most well-known for famous dishes they grace like matsutake gohan, but a little known snack served at some sushi restaurants is, you guessed it: raw matsutake.\nRaw matsutake have a powerful fragrance, so powerful some people won't like it. Powerful aromas and tastes are one of the hallmarks of a good delicacy though.\nAnother breadcrumb the Romans left behind is the second one in this list they named. Amanita caesarea literally means caesars mushroom, and it was reputedly served to them.\nIf the mushrooms were specifically served raw I don't know, since the only references I have of them in old Roman books are cooked, but it wouldn't be an outlandish thing to consider.\nThe Romans certainly ate stranger things. What I do know is that Caesar's mushroom are being eaten, possibly as I type this in France and Italy, and, I've eaten them myself.\nIn the open-air market of Aix-en-Provence, I got to try my first Amanita caesarea dipped in Provencal olive oil and sprinkled with coarse salt. It was excellent, and the mushrooms are served in salads like you might porcini.\nBeefsteak mushrooms are special in that they're the only polypore-type mushroom I know of that I enjoy raw. They're also one of the only mushrooms that I prefer to eat raw whenever I have them. Other polypores like hen of the woods and chicken of the woods mushrooms can have a bitter taste fresh, and chickens, depending on the type, could cause stomach problems with a few people.\nBeefsteak polypores though were born to eat raw. Beefsteaks have a gentle tart flavor to them that reminds me of weak sorrel, with the mushrooms I've had tasting cleaner and more pleasant young.\nBeefsteaks can be eaten just like you would porcini, and are likewise delicious eaten with olive oil, crunchy salt and fresh pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon. The only downside to beefsteaks, if it can even be said, is that they're rare, at least for me.\nWe can't forget about truffles. Just the thought of a waiter bringing over a truffle slicer and making it rain mushroom slices of the richest mushroom perfume is enough for most people to blow their, er, wine cork. I know here, some people will be quick to point out that truffles are small balls of mycelial tissue, and not technically mushrooms, but, for all intents and purposes, truffles are mushrooms.\nTruffles are a world unto themselves, with new ones seeming to enter our culinary lexicon regularly--each one having subtle preferences and preparations they lend themselves to better than others.\nFor example: black truffles are great raw and good cooked, slowly-simmered black truffle risotto being one of the most famous dishes I know to use them. Other truffles don't like to be cooked at all, and could have their flavor ruined by too much heat, specifically white truffles, including the famous Alba white, bainchetto, and the Hungarian honey truffle, all of which I've enjoyed.\nThese are probably the least known wild mushroom I've seen people eat raw, and, with the amount of raw black trumpets I eat when I incorporate them raw into a dish, it's almost not even worth mentioning, almost.\nWhen I eat black trumpets raw they're a novelty-a garnish strewn on something or a final touch as a way to add some volume or an interesting garnish (the same way I was served them at Jacques Chibois, in Provence.\nI've heard of black trumpets being called poor mans truffles, and that's how I use them raw: in tiny amounts, sprinkled on top as a garnish, a few slivers--nothing more. They make a great garnish to a bowl of pasta, or a slice of grilled bread slathered with mushroom butter and topped with a heap of sauteed, garlicky, buttery mushrooms.\nThis list will need to be updated, but for now, the most common will be fine.\nThe taste of raw shiitakes is, not that good, but I've seen them served raw in salads on occasion.\nTechnically portobellos and their cousins are all the same mushroom."], "label": "NS", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "There is debate over whether the US Federal Reserve should be abolished.", "reference_documents": ["March 19, 2008\nWASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve recently announced new measures to tackle the current financial crisis. They include helping J.P. Morgan Chase acquire Bear Stearns, lowering the discount rate and offering short-term loans to about 20 investment banks—and they came only days after the government said it would inject $200 billion into the financial system. These are the latest steps taken by the U.S. government to solve a problem created in large measure by the government itself. We have seen this movie before.\nAs a reaction to the bursting of the dot-com and telecom bubbles at the end of the 1990s, the Fed inflated the currency through the actions of its Open Market Committee. By June 2003, the policy of easy money was reflected in the drop of the federal funds rate to 1 percent. The loose monetary policy was maintained, with variations, for almost five years. The result was a fiction economy in which millions of people borrowed and consumed too much. The fact that mortgage loans were turned into sophisticated securities traded internationally made the fiction global.\nGreedy investors and profligate consumers are but a symptom of the real problem, which is monetary policy. The history of the boom-bust cycle since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 has been the deliberate increase of the money supply, the misallocation of resources due to the perverse incentives of inflation, and eventually the bursting of the bubble. It is the consequence of the Federal Reserve system, a central bank that confers upon a chosen elite—the Federal Reserve governors—the monopoly of money creation and the power to decide what amount of money is appropriate for an economy in which millions of people are making decisions they cannot anticipate.\nThe Fed was created as a response to the periodic bank runs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of the greatest economists have explained that part of that instability was caused not because private banks were free to issue currency (even as late as 1907) but because the government maintained a policy of rewarding irresponsible behavior by rescuing financial institutions when they reached the verge of collapse. In any case, as Milton Friedman wrote, the instability of the pre-Federal Reserve years was nothing compared to the booms and busts caused by the monetary authorities after 1913.\nNobel laureate Friedrich Hayek, whose free-market ideas triumphed with the collapse of the Soviet Union, frequently denounced the connection between central banks and the boom-bust cycle. In an interview conducted in 1977, he said, “If it were not for government interference with the monetary system, we would have no industrial fluctuations and no periods of depression. ... The mistake is the creation of a semi-monopoly where the basic money is controlled by the government. Since all the banks issue secondary money (in the form of loans based on deposits), which is redeemable in the basic money, you have a system which nobody can control.”\nIn many countries, money used to be in private hands (think House of Rothschild). The fact that money was issued by private institutions in part accounts for the extraordinary prosperity that Argentina enjoyed in the 19th century.\nIn a system of free banking, institutions that do not protect the value of the currency simply collapse—and their collapse does not wreck the entire economy. Under a rule of law that punishes fraud and counterfeiting, the risk of failure without bailouts is enough to guarantee a more stable system. And in such a system, it would be harder for the government to spend as much money as it does now—a major factor in the devaluation of the dollar—because it could not create money, only tax and borrow.\nAdvocating the abolition of the Federal Reserve, an institution people take for granted, seems too radical for most people, who think financial crises are the result of too little, not too much, government regulation. So the knee-jerk reaction, as exemplified in so many editorials and statements on the campaign trail nowadays, is to scream in favor of government intervention—the reason why bank rescues and the pumping of new money is the government’s sacrosanct policy.\nIt is time to think more boldly. If abolishing the Federal Reserve is politically inconceivable right now, there are less dramatic measures that can be taken on the road toward a definitive solution. The most obvious one is to simply stop using the Federal Reserve to inflate the currency.\nIf a crisis in which at least $400 billion has already been lost and millions of people have been badly hurt is not enough to set minds thinking audaciously, nothing will.\n© 2008, The Washington Post Writers Group\nAlvaro Vargas Llosa is a Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

Ideal weight range based on height and a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9.\nUnfortunately, BMI does have its limitations. It tends to overestimate or underestimate body fat in certain groups of people. For instance, at the same BMI:\n- men, on average, have less body fat than women\n- Asian people, on average, have more body fat than white people\n- white people, on average, have more body fat than black people\nA high BMI can also result from being lean or muscular, such as in the case of an athlete. This is because muscle is denser and weighs more than fat.\nBMI can also underestimate body fat in older people or those who have lost muscle or bone mass.\nAs mentioned earlier, the average weight for a group of people is not the same as a healthy weight.\nIf the average U.S. man weighs 195.7 pounds and stands 5 feet 9 tall, then his BMI is 28.9. That puts him firmly in the overweight category.\n, 73 percent of men and 66.2 percent of women in the US were estimated to be overweight or obese based on their BMI. These figures were just 60.9 and 51.4 percent for 1988–1994. Upward trends in weight have also been observed in other developed nations .\nBeing overweight or obese puts a person at greater risk of developing:\n- type 2 diabetes\n- gallbladder disease\n- osteoarthritis\n- some types of cancer\n- breathing problems, such as sleep apnea\nIt is usually recommended that people with a BMI above 30 should try to lose weight. People with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 should try to prevent further weight gain. However, they should also try to lose weight if they have two or more of the following risk factors:\n- family history of heart disease or diabetes\n- high blood pressure, high LDL or low HDL cholesterol , high triglycerides, diabetes\n- a waist circumference greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women\nEven losing a small amount of weight can improve overall health, lower blood pressure , and reduce the risk of developing other conditions.\nA doctor can advise on whether a person needs to lose weight or simply stop gaining it. They may also be able to help formulate a weight loss plan or be able to provide access to other professional advice and resources.\nGeneral tips for reaching and maintaining an ideal weight include:\n“Exercise more” and “eat less” are too vague, whereas “run 10 miles every day” or “lose 10 pounds each week” might be unrealistic.\nCommitting to walking for 30 minutes each day or losing 1 to 2 pounds a week, for example, would be far more sensible goals.\nPeople should aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity each week. The exercise should raise the heart rate and cause sweating.\nCycling, swimming, brisk walking, running, dancing, tennis, and soccer are all examples of suitable alternative or additional activities. If possible, an individual should aim for 60–90 minutes of exercise a day.\nPeople can try using smaller plates or replacing half of a normal meal with fruit and vegetables. Or aim to reduce consumption by 500 calories per day. Planning meals in advance can help with this.\nThose wanting to lose weight should focus on eating more fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. Also, they should aim to eat leaner meats and get protein from healthier sources, such as poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts.\nReplacing sugary drinks with water or drinking unsweetened tea and coffee is also helpful while also limiting alcohol.\nCalculating BMI can help men determine their ideal weight range.

Édith Piaf 's 1960 recording spent seven weeks atop the French Singles & Airplay Reviews chart. [1]\nThe song's composer, Charles Dumont , states in the book Édith Piaf, Opinions publiques , by Bernard Marchois (TF1 Editions 1995), that Michel Vaucaire's original title was \"Non, je ne trouverai rien\" (No, I will not find anything) and that the song was meant for the French singer Rosalie Dubois . However, thinking of Piaf, he changed the title to \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (No, I Regret Nothing).\nAccording to journalist Jean Noli, in his book Édith (Éditions Stock 1973), when Dumont and Vaucaire visited Piaf's home at Boulevard Lannes in Paris, on 24 October 1960, she received them in a very impolite and unfriendly manner. Dumont had tried to offer Piaf his compositions on several occasions, but she disliked them and had refused them. On that day she was furious that her housekeeper Danielle had arranged a meeting with the two men without informing her, so she let them wait an hour in her living room before she appeared. She told them she would listen to one song only. Dumont sang Non, je ne regrette rien , to which Piaf reacted extremely positively, saying \"This is the song I have been waiting for. It will be my biggest success! I want it for my coming performance at L'Olympia!\"\nPiaf dedicated her recording of the song to the Foreign Legion . [2] At the time of the recording, France was engaged in a military conflict, the Algerian War (1954–1962), and the 1st REP ( 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment )—which backed the failed 1961 putsch against president Charles de Gaulle and the civilian leadership of Algeria—adopted the song when their resistance was broken. The leadership of the Regiment was arrested and tried but the non-commissioned officers, corporals and Legionnaires were assigned to other Foreign Legion formations. They left the barracks singing the song, which has now become part of the Foreign Legion heritage and is sung when they are on parade.\nThe song begins, Non, rien de rien / Non, je ne regrette rien (\"No, nothing at all / No, I regret nothing\"). It goes on to describe how the singer has swept away all of his/her past and cares nothing for it, ending Car ma vie, car mes joies / Aujourd'hui, ça commence avec toi (\"For my life, for my joys / Today, it starts with you\").\nThe song has been recorded by other performers, including:\n- Piaf herself recorded an English version, titled No Regrets .\n- Shirley Bassey in 1965, (reaching No. 39 on the UK charts) and on the album Love Songs .\n- Karen Akers on her 1981 album \"Presenting Karen Akers\".\n- German singer Martinique released a Disco/Synth-Pop version \"No Regrets (Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien)\" in 1984\n- Bad Boys Blue in 1989, on album \" The Fifth \" recorded an English version titled No Regrets .\n- The rock band Half Man Half Biscuit recorded a 1991 English version titled No Regrets .\n- Emmylou Harris contributed an English version to the 1994 multi-artist \"Tribute to Edith Piaf\" album.\n- Elaine Paige on 1994 album Piaf , released to coincide with her portrayal of the lead character in the play of the same name.\n- Brazilian singer Cássia Eller in 2001 Acústico MTV album.\n- Vicky Leandros on her 2010 album \"Zeitlos\" (Timeless) sung in German with the title \"Nein, ich bereue nichts\" .\n- Cajun band Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys on their 2011 album Grand Isle .\n- Frances McDormand as Captain DuBois sings the song in Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted .\n- Raquel Bitton sang \"No Regrets\" in the film \"Piaf..Her story..Her songs\" and CD \"Raquel Bitton sings Edith Piaf\"\n- \"Nej, jag ångrar ingenting\" (Swedish) by Anita Lindblom in 1961\n- \"Ne oplakujem\" (Croatian) by Tereza Kesovija in 1962\n- \"Ne oplakujem\" (Croatian) by Ana Štefok in 1964\n- \"Ne, ne žalim ni za čim\" (Serbian) by Lola Novaković in 1964\n- \"Nej, jag ångrar ingenting\" (Swedish) by Gun Sjöberg in 1966\n- \"Nelituj\" (Czech) by Světlana Nálepková in 2005\n- \"Ne, ni mi žal\" (Slovenian) by Aleš Polajnar in 2014\n- \"No dico no\" (Italian) by Dalida\n- \"No me puedo quejar\" (Spanish) by Dalida\n- \"Nah de Nah\" (Spanish) by Javiera Mena\n- \"Nem, nem bánok semmit sem\" (Hungarian) by Vári Éva\n- Elvina Makarian (Armenian Legendary Jazz Singer).\n- In the United Kingdom, the song was at one time associated with the former Conservative politician Norman Lamont , former Chancellor of the Exchequer , who quoted the song's title to sum up his political career.

Vinegar, lemon juice, and corn syrup are common swaps for the pantry staple.\nCream of tartar is an oft-overlooked pantry staple. The white powder helps to stabilize whipped egg whites in cakes and meringues, activate leavening like baking soda (it’s often an ingredient in baking powder ), and prevent sugar crystallization in caramel and candy.\nIt’s worth keeping a jar stashed next to your baking soda and powder since it lasts forever, but accidents happen. If you misread your recipe or didn’t realize you were out of cream of tartar and can’t make a trip to the store, it’s time to fall back on a substitution. Which swap you make will depend on what purpose the cream of tartar is serving in your particular recipe.\nIf you’re dealing with whipped egg whites, that means the cream of tartar is serving as a stabilizer, cushioning the delicate pockets of air to keep the mixture fluffy and tall. You might be making a meringue, whether it’s a topping for pie, pavlova , meringue frosting, or meringue candies. Or perhaps you’re making a fluffy cake that relies on egg whites for its lift, such as an angel food cake .\nIf your recipe calls for whipped egg whites and a little cream of tartar, try these substitutions:\nVinegar: You’ll sometimes find vinegar called for in meringue recipes (especially meringue cookies which have stronger flavorings) instead of cream of tartar. When substituting for cream of tartar, you’ll need to use four times more vinegar. If a recipe calls for 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar, add one teaspoon of vinegar instead.\nThe only downside of using vinegar is the strong flavor can sneak through. For this reason, white vinegar is the go-to vinegar for substituting cream of tartar, since it has the least distinct flavor.\nLemon juice : If you’d rather not use vinegar, fresh lemon juice is a good option. It acts in the exact same way as vinegar and should be used in the same ratio: use four times more lemon juice than cream of tartar. Your meringue or cake will take on a bit of lemony tang, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing!\nCream of tartar also provides some security when boiling sugar. The powder helps prevent sugar crystals from forming, producing smoother caramels and sugar syrups that can be used as-is, in other recipes, or candy making. When a recipe calls for boiling sugar and the ingredient list includes cream of tartar, try substituting corn syrup.\nFound in the baking aisle, corn syrup is very good at preventing crystallization. Swap 1/4 of the sugar in your recipe for corn syrup and omit the cream of tartar.\nCream of tartar is a common ingredient in baking powder. It activates the baking soda, giving cakes and baked goods lift without the need of an additional acidic ingredient.\nIf your baked good calls for cream of tartar along with baking soda as a leavening agent, try these substitutions:\nBaking powder : When a baking recipe calls for baking soda and cream of tartar in the dry ingredients, you can often swap for baking powder, which is baking soda and cream of tartar already mixed together.\nStore-bought baking powder is mixed at a ratio of one part baking soda to 2 parts cream of tartar, so keep this in mind when swapping. For example, if your recipe calls for 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, swap both for 3/4 teaspoon baking powder.\nVinegar or lemon juice : It’s not ideal to substitute a dry ingredient for a wet ingredient while baking since it can alter the texture, but using vinegar or lemon juice instead of cream of tartar will work in a pinch. You’ll need more volume to activate the baking soda—try using at least two times the amount of cream of tartar."], "label": "S", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The ancient Silk Road connected China with Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, facilitating the exchange of goods, knowledge, and cultural ideas .", "reference_documents": ["The Silk Road was a network of ancient trade routes, formally established during the Han Dynasty of China in 130 BCE, which linked the regions of the ancient world in commerce between 130 BCE-1453 CE. The Silk Road was not a single route from east to west and so historians favor the name 'Silk Routes', though 'Silk Road' is commonly used.\n\nThe European explorer Marco Polo (l.1254-1324 CE) traveled on these routes and described them in depth in his famous work but he is not credited with naming them. Both terms for this network of roads - Silk Road and Silk Routes - were coined by the German geographer and traveler, Ferdinand von Richthofen, in 1877 CE, who designated them 'Seidenstrasse' (silk road) or 'Seidenstrassen' (silk routes). Polo, and later von Richthofen, make mention of the goods which were transported back and forth on the Silk Road.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nFrom West to East these goods included:\n\nHorses\n\nSaddles and Riding Tack\n\nThe grapevine and grapes\n\nDogs and other animals both exotic and domestic\n\nAnimal furs and skins\n\nHoney\n\nFruits\n\nGlassware\n\nWoolen blankets, rugs, carpets\n\nTextiles (such as curtains)\n\nGold and Silver\n\nCamels\n\nSlaves\n\nWeapons and armor\n\nFrom East to West the goods included:\n\nSilk\n\nTea\n\nDyes\n\nPrecious Stones\n\nChina (plates, bowls, cups, vases)\n\nPorcelain\n\nSpices (such as cinnamon and ginger)\n\nBronze and gold artifacts\n\nMedicine\n\nPerfumes\n\nIvory\n\nRice\n\nPaper\n\nGunpowder\n\nThe network was used regularly from 130 BCE, when the Han Dynasty (202 BCE - 220 CE) officially opened trade with the west, to 1453 CE, when the Ottoman Empire boycotted trade with the west and closed the routes. By this time, Europeans had become used to the goods from the east and, when the Silk Road closed, merchants needed to find new trade routes to meet the demand for these goods.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nCamel with Guide, Tang Dynasty Jan van der Crabben (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nThe closure of the Silk Road initiated the Age of Discovery (also known as the Age of Exploration, 1453-1660 CE) which would be defined by European explorers taking to the sea and charting new water routes to replace over-land trade. The Age of Discovery would impact cultures around the world as European ships claimed some lands in the name of their god and country and influenced others by introducing western culture and religion and, at the same time, these other nations influenced European cultural traditions. The Silk Road - from its opening to its closure - had so great an impact on the development of world civilization that it is difficult to imagine the modern world without it.\n\nPersian Royal Road\n\nThe history of the Silk Road pre-dates the Han Dynasty in practice, however, as the Persian Royal Road, which would come to serve as one of the main arteries of the Silk Road, was established during the Achaemenid Empire (c. 550-330 BCE). The Persian Royal Road ran from Susa, in north Persia (modern day Iran) to the Mediterranean Sea in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) and featured postal stations along the route with fresh horses for envoys to quickly deliver messages throughout the empire. Herodotus, writing of the speed and efficiency of the Persian messengers, stated that:\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThere is nothing in the world that travels faster than these Persian couriers. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor darkness of night prevents these couriers from completing their designated stages with utmost speed. (Histories VIII.98)\n\nThese lines would, centuries later, form the creed of the United States of America's post office. The Persians maintained the Royal Road carefully and, in time, expanded it through smaller side roads. These paths eventually crossed down into the Indian subcontinent, across Mesopotamia, and over into Egypt.\n\nPersian Royal Road Fabienkhan (CC BY-SA)\n\nChina & the West\n\nAfter Alexander the Great conquered the Persians, he established the city (later the Greek Kingdom) of Alexandria Eschate in 339 BCE in the Fergana Valley of Neb (modern Tajikistan). Leaving behind his wounded veterans in the city, Alexander moved on. In time, these Macedonian warriors intermarried with the indigenous populace creating the Greco-Bactrian culture which flourished under the Seleucid Empire following Alexander's death.\n\nUnder the Greco-Bactrian king Euthydemus I (r. 260-195 BCE) the Greco-Bactrians had extended their holdings. According to the Greek historian Strabo (63-24 CE) the Greeks “extended their empire as far as the Seres” (Geography XI.ii.i). `Seres' was the name by which the Greeks and Romans knew China, meaning `the land where silk came from' in East Asia. It is thought, then, that the first contact between China and the west came around the year 200 BCE.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nEmperor Wu was eager to gain new commodities through trade with the west & the Silk Road was opened in 130 BCE.\n\nThe Han Dynasty of China was regularly harassed by the nomadic tribes of the Xiongnu on their northern and western borders. In 138 BCE, Emperor Wu sent his emissary Zhang Qian to the west to negotiate with the Yuezhi people for help in defeating the Xiongnu.\n\nZhang Qian's expedition led him into contact with many different cultures and civilizations in central Asia and, among them, those whom he designated the `Dayuan', the `Great Ionians', who were the Greco-Bactrians descended from Alexander the Great's army. The Dayuan had mighty horses, Zhang Qian reported back to Wu, and these could be employed effectively against the marauding Xiongnu.\n\nThe consequences of Zhang Qian's journey was not only further contact between China and the west but an organized and efficient horse breeding program throughout the land in order to equip a cavalry. The horse had long been known in China and had been used in warfare for cavalry and chariots as early as the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE) but the Chinese admired the western horse for its size and speed. With the western horse of the Dayuan, the Han Dynasty defeated the Xiongnu. This success inspired Emperor Wu to speculate on what else might be gained through trade with the west and the Silk Road was opened in 130 BCE.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nBetween 171-138 BCE, Mithridates I of Parthia campaigned to expand and consolidate his kingdom in Mesopotamia. The Seleucid King Antiochus VII Sidetes (r. 138-129 BCE) opposed this expansion and, also wishing revenge for the death of his brother, Demetrius, waged war against the Parthian forces of Phrates II, Mithridates successor. With the defeat of Antiochus, Mesopotamia came under Parthian rule and, with it, came control of the Silk Road. The Parthians then became the central intermediaries between China and the west.\n\nWomen Checking Silk, Song China. Unknown Artist (Public Domain)\n\nGoods Traded via the Silk Road\n\nWhile many different kinds of merchandise traveled along the network of trade of the Silk Road, the name comes from the popularity of Chinese silk with the west, especially with Rome. The Silk Road routes stretched from China through India, Asia Minor, up throughout Mesopotamia, to Egypt, the African continent, Greece, Rome, and Britain.\n\nThe northern Mesopotamian region (present-day Iran) became China's closest partner in trade, as part of the Parthian Empire, initiating important cultural exchanges. Paper, which had been invented by the Chinese during the Han Dynasty, and gunpowder, also a Chinese invention, had a much greater impact on culture than did silk. The rich spices of the east, also, contributed more than the fashion which grew up from the silk industry. Even so, by the time of the Roman Emperor Augustus (r. 27 BCE – 14 CE) trade between China and the west was firmly established and silk was the most sought-after commodity in Egypt, Greece, and, especially, in Rome.\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\nTrade Links between the Roman Empire and the East (1st - 3rd centuries) Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nThe Roman Love of Silk\n\nPrior to becoming Emperor Augustus, Octavian Caesar seized on the controversial topic of silk clothing to denounce his adversaries Mark Antony (l. 83-30 BCE) and Cleopatra VII (l. 69-30 BCE) as immoral. As they both favored Chinese silk, which was increasingly becoming associated with licentiousness, Octavian exploited the link to deprecate his enemies. Octavian would triumph over Antony and Cleopatra; he could do nothing, however, to curtail the popularity of silk.\n\nThe historian Will Durant writes:\n\nThe Romans thought [silk] a vegetable product combed from trees and valued it at its weight in gold. Much of this silk came to the island of Kos, where it was woven into dresses for the ladies of Rome and other cities; in A.D. 91 the relatively poor state of Messenia had to forbid its women to wear transparent silk dresses at religious initiations. (329)\n\nThe island of Kos became wealthy & luxurious through their manufacture of silk clothing.\n\nBy the time of Seneca the Younger (l. 4 BCE – 65 CE), conservative Romans were more ardent than Augustus in decrying the Chinese silk as immoral dress for women and effeminate attire for men. These criticisms did nothing to stop the silk trade with Rome, however, and the island of Kos became wealthy and luxurious through their manufacture of silk clothing.\n\nAs Durant writes, \"Italy enjoyed an 'unfavorable' balance of trade – cheerfully [buying] more than she sold” but still exported rich goods to China such as “carpets, jewels, amber, metals, dyes, drugs, and glass” (328-329). Up through the time of the emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.161-180 CE), silk was the most valued commodity in Rome and no amount of conservative criticism seemed to be able to slow the trade or stop the fashion.\n\nTyrian Purple Shroud of Charlemagne Unknown Artist (Public Domain)\n\nEven after Aurelius, silk remained popular, though increasingly expensive, until the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 CE. Rome was survived by its eastern half which came to be known as the Byzantine Empire and which carried on the Roman infatuation with silk. Around 60 CE the west had become aware that silk was not grown on the trees in China but was actually spun by silkworms. The Chinese had very purposefully kept the origin of silk a secret and, once it was out, carefully guarded their silkworms and their process of harvesting the silk.\n\nThe Byzantine emperor Justinian (r. 527- 565 CE), tired of paying the exorbitant prices the Chinese demanded for silk, sent two emissaries, disguised as monks, to China to steal silkworms and smuggle them back to the west. The plan was successful and initiated the Byzantine silk industry. When the Byzantine Empire fell to the Turks in 1453 CE, the Ottoman Empire closed the ancient routes of the Silk Road and cut all ties with the west.\n\nThe Silk Road Legacy\n\nThe greatest value of the Silk Road was the exchange of culture. Art, religion, philosophy, technology, language, science, architecture, and every other element of civilization was exchanged along these routes, carried with the commercial goods the merchants traded from country to country. Along this network disease traveled also, as evidenced in the spread of the bubonic plague of 542 CE which is thought to have arrived in Constantinople by way of the Silk Road and which decimated the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe closing of the Silk Road forced merchants to take to the sea to ply their trade, thus initiating the Age of Discovery which led to world-wide interaction and the beginnings of a global community. In its time, the Silk Road served to broaden people's understanding of the world they lived in; its closure would propel Europeans across the ocean to explore, and eventually conquer, the so-called New World of the Americas initiating the so-called Columbian Exchange by which goods and values were passed between those of the Old World and those of the New, universally to the detriment of the indigengous people of the New World. In this way, the Silk Road can be said to have established the groundwork for the development of the modern world."], "label": "S", "category": "ExpertQA", "additional_info": ""}

Many of the symptoms of Parkinson's are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes irregular brain activity, leading to problems with movement and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors appear to play a role, including:\n\nGenes. Researchers have identified specific genetic changes that can cause Parkinson's disease. But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many family members affected by Parkinson's disease. However, certain gene variations appear to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease but with a relatively small risk of Parkinson's disease for each of these genetic markers.\n\nEnvironmental triggers. Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease, but the risk is small.\n\nResearchers also have noted that many changes occur in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease, although it's not clear why these changes occur. These changes include:\n\nThe presence of Lewy bodies. Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are microscopic markers of Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these Lewy bodies hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease.\n\nClumps of specific substances within brain cells are microscopic markers of Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these Lewy bodies hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease. Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies. Although many substances are found within Lewy bodies, scientists believe that an important one is the natural and widespread protein called alpha-synuclein, also called a-synuclein. It's found in all Lewy bodies in a clumped form that cells can't break down. This is currently an important focus among Parkinson's disease researchers. Researchers have found the clumped alpha-synuclein protein in the spinal fluid of people who later develop Parkinson's disease.\n\nRisk factors\n\nRisk factors for Parkinson's disease include:\n\nAge. Young adults rarely experience Parkinson's disease. It ordinarily begins in middle or late life, and the risk increases with age. People usually develop the disease around age 60 or older. If a young person does have Parkinson's disease, genetic counseling might be helpful in making family planning decisions. Work, social situations and medicine side effects are also different from those of an older person with Parkinson's disease and require special considerations.\n\nYoung adults rarely experience Parkinson's disease.

For its oversight body, see NHS England . For the health services in the UK as a whole, see National Health Service\n\nNorfolk and Norwich University Hospital, which with 1237 beds is one of the largest NHS hospitals\n\nQueen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, another large NHS hospital in England, which has 1213 beds\n\nThe National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded healthcare system in England, and one of the four National Health Service systems in the United Kingdom. It is the second largest single-payer healthcare system in the world after the Brazilian Sistema Único de Saúde. Primarily funded by the government from general taxation (plus a small amount from National Insurance contributions), and overseen by the Department of Health and Social Care, the NHS provides healthcare to all legal English residents and residents from other regions of the UK, with most services free at the point of use for most people.[4] The NHS also conducts research through the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).[5]\n\nFree healthcare at the point of use comes from the core principles at the founding of the National Health Service. The 1942 Beveridge cross-party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the Labour government in 1948. Labour's Minister for Health Aneurin Bevan is popularly considered the NHS's founder,[6][7][8] despite never formally being referred to as such. In practice, \"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system (i.e. in possession of an NHS number), available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality (but not non-resident British citizens), can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care, without payment except for some specific NHS services, for example eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of long-term care. These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients.[9][10]\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including primary care, in-patient care, long-term healthcare, ophthalmology and dentistry. The National Health Service Act 1946 came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance: it is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services.\n\nThe NHS is largely funded from general taxation, with a small amount being contributed by National Insurance payments[11] and from fees levied in accordance with recent changes in the Immigration Act 2014.[12] The UK government department responsible for the NHS is the Department of Health and Social Care, headed by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. The Department of Health and Social Care had a £110 billion budget in 2013–14, most of this being spent on the NHS.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nAneurin Bevan. As health minister from 1945 to 1951, he spearheaded the establishment of the National Health Service\n\nLeaflet concerning the launch of the NHS in England and Wales\n\nA. J. Cronin's controversial novel The Citadel, published in 1937, had fomented extensive debate about the severe inadequacies of healthcare. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.[13]\n\nA national health service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the Beveridge Report. The Emergency Hospital Service established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\n\nHealthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific General Practice (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of National Insurance and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s, Thatcherism represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the post-war consensus, wherein the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism, the welfare state, the mixed economy, supplies both of public and private housing, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. In 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons that the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\"[14]\n\nOrganisation [ edit ]\n\nThe NHS was established within the differing nations of the United Kingdom through differing legislation, and such there has never been a singular British healthcare system, instead there are 4 health services in the United Kingdom; NHS England, the NHS Scotland, HSC Northern Ireland and NHS Wales, which were run by the respective UK government ministries for each home nation before falling under the control of devolved governments in 1999.[15] In 2009, NHS England agreed to a formal NHS constitution, which sets out the legal rights and responsibilities of the NHS, its staff, and users of the service, and makes additional non-binding pledges regarding many key aspects of its operations.[16]\n\nThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 came into effect in April 2013, giving GP-led groups responsibility for commissioning most local NHS services. Starting in April 2013, primary care trusts (PCTs) began to be replaced by general practitioner (GP)-led organisations called clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). Under the new system, a new NHS Commissioning Board, called NHS England, oversees the NHS from the Department of Health.[17] The Act has also become associated with the perception of increased private provision of NHS services. In reality, the provision of NHS services by private companies long precedes this legislation, but there are concerns that the new role of the healthcare regulator ('Monitor') could lead to increased use of private-sector competition, balancing care options between private companies, charities, and NHS organisations.[17] NHS trusts responded to the Nicholson challenge—which involved making £20 billion in savings across the service by 2015.\n\nCore principles [ edit ]\n\nThe principal NHS website states the following as core principles:[18]\n\nThe NHS was born out of a long-held ideal that good healthcare should be available to all, regardless of wealth. At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles: That it meet the needs of everyone\n\nThat it be free at the point of delivery\n\nThat it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay These three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than half a century and remain. However, in July 2000, a full-scale modernisation programme was launched and new principles added.\n\nThe main aims of the additional principles are that the NHS will:\n\nProvide a comprehensive range of services\n\nShape its services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers\n\nRespond to the different needs of different populations\n\nWork continuously to improve the quality of services and to minimise errors\n\nSupport and value its staff\n\nUse public funds for healthcare devoted solely to NHS patients\n\nWork with others to ensure a seamless service for patients\n\nHelp to keep people healthy and work to reduce health inequalities\n\nRespect the confidentiality of individual patients and provide open access to information about services, treatment and performance\n\nStructure [ edit ]\n\nThe English NHS is controlled by the UK government through the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), which takes political responsibility for the service. Resource allocation and oversight was delegated to NHS England, an arms-length body, by the Health and Social Care Act 2012. NHS England commissions primary care services (including GPs) and some specialist services, and allocates funding to 211[19] geographically based clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) across England. The CCGs commission most services in their areas, including hospital and community-based healthcare.[20]\n\nA number of types of organisation are commissioned to provide NHS services, including NHS trusts and private sector companies. Many NHS trusts have become NHS foundation trusts, giving them an independent legal status and greater financial freedoms. The following types of NHS trusts and foundation trusts provide NHS services in specific areas:[21]\n\nSome services are provided at a national level, including:\n\nwww.nhs.uk is the primary public-facing NHS website, providing comprehensive official information on services, treatments, conditions, healthy living and current health topics\n\nSpecial health authorities provide various types of services\n\nStaffing [ edit ]\n\nIn the year ending at March 2017, there were 1.187 million staff in England's NHS, 1.9% more than in March 2016.[22] There were 34,260 unfilled nursing and midwifery posts in England by September 2017, this was the highest level since records began.[23] 23% of women giving birth were left alone part of the time causing anxiety to the women and possible danger to them and their babies. This is because there are too few midwives.[24] Neonatal mortality rose from 2.6 deaths for every 1,000 births in 2015 to 2.7 deaths per 1,000 births in 2016. Infant mortality (deaths during the first year of life) rose from 3.7 to 3.8 per 1,000 live births during the same period.[25] Assaults on NHS staff have increased, there were 56,435 recorded physical assaults on staff in 2016–2017, 9.7% more than the 51,447 the year before. Low staffing levels and delays in patients being treated are blamed for this.[26]\n\nNearly all hospital doctors and nurses in England are employed by the NHS and work in NHS-run hospitals, with teams of more junior hospital doctors (most of whom are in training) being led by consultants, each of whom is trained to provide expert advice and treatment within a specific speciality. From 2017, NHS doctors must reveal how much money they make from private practice.[27]\n\nGeneral practitioners, dentists, optometrists (opticians) and other providers of local health care are almost all self-employed, and contract their services back to the NHS. They may operate in partnership with other professionals, own and operate their own surgeries and clinics, and employ their own staff, including other doctors etc. However, the NHS does sometimes provide centrally employed health care professionals and facilities in areas where there is insufficient provision by self-employed professionals.\n\nStaff in NHS England from 2010 - 2017.[28]\n\nYear[29] Nurses Doctors Other qualified[30] Managers Total 1978 339,658 55,000 26,000 - 1,003,000[31] (UK) 2010 318,935 102,422 180,621 40,025 1,168,750[28] 2011 317,157 103,898 184,869 35,014 1,158,920[28] 2012 310,359 105,019 183,818 33,023 1,128,140[28] 2013 308,782 106,151 184,571 32,429 1,123,529[28] 2014 314,097 107,896 187,699 28,499 1,126,947[28] 2015 316,117 109,890 189,321 30,221 1,143,102[28] 2016 318,912 110,732 193,073 31,523 1,164,471[28] 2017 319,845 113,508 198,783 32,588 1,187,125[28]\n\nNote that due to methodological changes, the 1978 figure is not directly comparable with later figures.\n\nA 2012 analysis by the BBC estimated that the NHS across the whole UK has 1.7 million staff, which made it fifth on the list of the world's largest employers (well above Indian Railways).[32] In 2015 the Health Service Journal reported that there were 587,647 non-clinical staff in the English NHS. 17% worked supporting clinical staff. 2% in cleaning and 14% administrative. 16,211 were finance staff.[33]\n\nThe NHS plays a unique role in the training of new doctors in England, with approximately 8,000 places for student doctors each year, all of which are attached to an NHS University Hospital trust. After completing medical school, these new doctors must go on to complete a two-year foundation training programme to become fully registered with the General Medical Council. Most go on to complete their foundation training years in an NHS hospital although some may opt for alternative employers such as the armed forces.[34] Most NHS staff, including non-clinical staff and GPs (although most GPs are self-employed), are eligible to join the NHS Pension Scheme—which, from 1 April 2015, is an average-salary defined-benefit scheme. Among the current challenges with recruiting staff are pay, work pressure,[35][36][37] and difficulty recruiting and retaining staff from EU countries due to Brexit.[38] and there are fears that doctors could also leave.[39][40]\n\nIn March 2021, the Department of Health and Social Care made a non-binding recommendation that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay rise for 2021–2022, citing the 'uncertain' financial situation and the current low inflation.[41][42] This is estimated to cost £500 million a year, as almost half of the NHS's budget goes on staffing costs (at £56.1 billion).[42] The Trades Union Congress estimated that nurses' pay would be £2,500 less than in 2010, paramedics' pay would be £3,330 less and porters' pay would be £850 less due to inflation.[43] The Royal College of Nursing has criticized the pay rise, calling it 'pitiful' and said that nurses should be getting 12.5% more; it has also agreed to set up a £35m fund to support members in the event of a strike.[43][44] Other unions have threatened strike actions and warned that the proposal could lead to staff quitting their jobs, worsening staffing issues.[44][45][46] The Labour Party similarly criticized the proposal as 'reprehensible' and claimed that it goes against a government 'promise' made in 2020 to give NHS workers a 2.1% pay rise, which was voted for in a long-term spending plan in January 2020 but the Department of Health considered to be not legally binding.[44][46][47] Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the 1% pay rise, stating that the government is giving workers \"as much as we can\" in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and that he was \"massively grateful\" to the health and social care workers.[46] Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock and Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson have similarly argued that the decision was due to an assessment of what was affordable due to the pandemic and that NHS staff was excluded from a wider public sector pay freeze.[47][43] The Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration, an independent review body, is expected to make its own recommendations on NHS salaries in May 2021, which may differ from the Department of Health's recommendation.[43][46] Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Jon Ashworth has clarified that Labour would \"honour whatever the review body recommends\".[46]\n\nAt the end of 2021 there were 99,000 vacancies in the English NHS. 39,000 more nurses were needed, together with 1,400 more anesthetists, 1,900 more radiologists and 2,500 more GPs.[48]\n\nMiriam Deakin of NHS Providers stated there were 133,000 NHS vacancies in late 2022.[49]\n\n2012 reforms [ edit ]\n\nThe coalition government's white paper on health reform, published in July 2010, set out a significant reorganisation of the NHS. The white paper, Equity and excellence: liberating the NHS,[50] with implications for all health organisations in the NHS abolishing primary care trusts and strategic health authorities. It claimed to shift power from the centre to GPs and patients, moving somewhere between £60 and £80 billion into the hands of clinical commissioning groups to commission services. The bill became law in March 2012 with a government majority of 88 and following more than 1,000 amendments in the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\n\nFunding [ edit ]\n\nThe total budget of Department of Health in England in 2017/18 was £124.7 billion.[51] £13.8 billion was spent on medicines.[52] The National Audit Office reports annually on the summarised consolidated accounts of the NHS.[53]\n\nThe population of England is ageing, which has led to an increase in health demand and funding. From 2011 to 2018, the population of England increased by about 6%. The number of patients admitted to hospital in an emergency went up by 15%.[54] There were 542,435 emergency hospital admissions in England in October 2018, 5.8% more than in October 2017.[55] Health spending in England is expected to rise from £112 billion in 2009/10 to £127 billion in 2019/20 (in real terms),[51] and spending per head will increase by 3.5%.[56]\n\nHowever, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), compared to the increase necessary to keep up with a rising population that is also ageing, spending will fall by 1.3% from 2009–10 to 2019–20.[57][56] George Stoye, senior research economist of the IFS, and said the annual increases since 2009-10 were \"the lowest rate of increase over any similar period since the mid-1950s, since when the long-run annual growth rate has been 4.1%\".[57] This has led to cuts to some services, despite the overall increase in funding.[58] In 2017, funding increased by 1.3% while demand rose by 5%.[59] Ted Baker, Chief Inspector of Hospitals has said that the NHS is still running the model it had in the 1960s and 1970s and has not modernised due to lack of investment.[60] The British Medical Association (BMA) has called for £10bn more annually for the NHS to get in line with what other advanced European nations spend on health.[61] In June 2018 ahead of the NHS' 70th Anniversary then Prime Minister Theresa May announced extra funding for the NHS worth an average real terms increase of 3.4% a year, reaching £20.5 billion extra in 2023/24.[62]\n\nJeremy Hunt describes the process of setting the NHS budget as far too random - \"decided on the back of headlines, elections and anniversaries rather than on rational calculations of demand and cost.\"[63]\n\nThe commissioning system [ edit ]\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013 the principal fundholders in the NHS system were the primary care trusts (PCTs), that commissioned healthcare from NHS trusts, GPs and private providers. PCTs disbursed funds to them on an agreed tariff or contract basis, on guidelines set out by the Department of Health. The PCTs budget from the Department of Health was calculated on a formula basis relating to population and specific local needs. They were supposed to \"break even\" – that is, not show a deficit on their budgets at the end of the financial year. Failure to meet financial objectives could result in the dismissal and replacement of a trust's board of directors, although such dismissals are enormously expensive for the NHS.[64]\n\nFrom April 2013 a new system was established as a result of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. The NHS budget is largely in the hands of a new body, NHS England. NHS England commissions specialist services and primary care. Acute services and community care are commissioned by local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) led by GPs. From April 2021 all CCGs have become part of Integrated Care Systems.\n\nFree services and contributory services [ edit ]\n\nServices free at the point of use [ edit ]\n\nThe vast majority of NHS services are free at the point of use.\n\nThis means that people generally do not pay anything for their doctor visits, nursing services, surgical procedures or appliances, consumables such as medications and bandages, plasters, medical tests, and investigations, x-rays, CT or MRI scans or other diagnostic services. Hospital inpatient and outpatient services are free, both medical and mental health services. Funding for these services is provided through general taxation and not a specific tax.\n\nBecause the NHS is not funded by a contributory insurance scheme in the ordinary sense and most patients pay nothing for their treatment there is thus no billing to the treated person nor to any insurer or sickness fund as is common in many other countries. This saves hugely on administration costs that might otherwise involve complex consumable tracking and usage procedures at the patient level and concomitant invoicing, reconciliation and bad debt processing.\n\nEligibility [ edit ]\n\nEligibility for NHS services is based on having ordinary resident status, regardless of nationality.\n\nPrescription charges [ edit ]\n\nPrescriptions for medication in England and Wales are subject to a fixed charge per item for up to three months' supply, regardless of the actual cost of the medicine. Some people qualify for free prescriptions. Higher charges apply to medical appliances. Pharmacies or other dispensing contractors are reimbursed for the actual cost of the medicines through NHS Prescription Services, a division of the NHS Business Services Authority.\n\nAs of March 2023 the NHS prescription charge in England was £9.35 per item[65] (in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland[66] there is no charge for items prescribed on the NHS. People over sixty, children under sixteen (or under nineteen if in full-time education), patients with certain medical conditions, and those with low incomes, are exempt from charges, subject to penalties for claiming exemption when not entitled. Those who require repeated prescriptions may purchase a single-charge pre-payment certificate that allows unlimited prescriptions during its period of validity.\n\nThe high and rising costs of some medicines, especially some types of cancer treatment, means that prescriptions can present a heavy burden to the primary care trusts, whose limited budgets include responsibility for the difference between medicine costs and the low, fixed prescription charge. This has led to disputes whether some expensive drugs (e.g., Herceptin) should be prescribed by the NHS.[67]\n\nNHS dentistry [ edit ]\n\nThe position of dentistry within the NHS has been contested frequently. At the inception of the NHS, three branches of dental service were established: local health authority dental service; general practitioner service; and hospital dental service.[68] Dental treatment was initially free at the point of use; however charges were introduced in 1951 for dentures – leading to the resignation of the architect of the NHS and Minister for Labour, Aneurin Bevan in March 1951 [69] – and in 1952 for other treatments.[70]\n\nDentists are private contractors to the NHS, which means practitioners must purchase and maintain the practice premises, equip the surgery, and hire staff in order to provide an NHS dental service. The contract between the NHS and dentists determines what work is provided for under the NHS, payments to dentists, and charges to patients. The contract is regularly revised – in 2003, the Government announced major changes to NHS dentistry, giving primary care trusts (PCTs) responsibility for commissioning NHS dental services in response to local needs, and using NHS contracts to influence where dental practices were located, and in 2006 a new contract was introduced following Department of Health recommendations on how to cash limit NHS primary care dentistry.[71] Professional bodies such as the British Dental Association have complained that the 2006 contract changes introduced a remuneration system which fails to incentivise disease prevention, leading to declining patient outcomes, and that radical reform was needed.[72]\n\nNHS dentistry charges as of April 2017 were: £20.60 for an examination; £56.30 for a filling or extraction; and £244.30 for more complex procedures such as crowns, dentures or bridges.[73] As of 2007, less than half of dentists' income came from treating patients under NHS coverage; about 52% of dentists' income was from treating private patients.[74]\n\nNHS Optical Services [ edit ]\n\nFrom 1 April 2007 the NHS Sight Test Fee (in England) was £19.32, and there were 13.1 million NHS sight tests carried out in the UK.\n\nFor those who qualify through need, the sight test is free, and a voucher system is employed to pay for or reduce the cost of lenses. There is a free spectacles frame and most opticians keep a selection of low-cost items. For those who already receive certain means-tested benefits, or who otherwise qualify, participating opticians use tables to find the amount of the subsidy.\n\nInjury cost recovery scheme [ edit ]\n\nUnder older legislation (mainly the Road Traffic Act 1930) a hospital treating the victims of a road traffic accident was entitled to limited compensation (under the 1930 Act before any amendment, up to £25 per person treated) from the insurers of driver(s) of the vehicle(s) involved, but were not compelled to do so and often did not do so; the charge was in turn covered by the then legally required element of those drivers' motor vehicle insurance (commonly known as Road Traffic Act insurance when a driver held only that amount of insurance). As the initial bill went to the driver rather than the insurer, even when a charge was imposed it was often not passed on to the liable insurer. It was common to take no further action in such cases, as there was no practical financial incentive (and often a financial disincentive due to potential legal costs) for individual hospitals to do so.\n\nThe Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a standard national scheme for recovery of costs using a tariff based on a single charge for out-patient treatment or a daily charge for in-patient treatment; these charges again ultimately fell upon insurers. This scheme did not however fully cover the costs of treatment in serious cases.[citation needed]\n\nSince January 2007, the NHS has a duty to claim back the cost of treatment, and for ambulance services, for those who have been paid personal injury compensation.[75] In the last year of the scheme immediately preceding 2007, over £128 million was reclaimed.[76]\n\nFrom April 2019 £725 is payable for outpatient treatment, £891 per day for inpatient treatment and £219 per ambulance journey.[77]\n\nCar park charges [ edit ]\n\nCar parking charges are a minor source of revenue for the NHS,[78] with most hospitals deriving about 0.25% of their budget from them.[79] The level of fees is controlled individually by each trust.[78] In 2006 car park fees contributed £78 million towards hospital budgets.[78][79] Patient groups are opposed to such charges.[78] This contrasts with Scotland where car park charges were mostly scrapped from the beginning of 2009[80] and with Wales where car park charges were scrapped at the end of 2011.[81]\n\nCharitable funds [ edit ]\n\nThere are over 300 official NHS charities in England and Wales. Collectively, they hold assets in excess of £2 billion and have an annual income in excess of £300 million.[82] Some NHS charities have their own independent board of trustees whilst in other cases the relevant NHS trust acts as a corporate trustee. Charitable funds are typically used for medical research, larger items of medical equipment, aesthetic and environmental improvements, or services that increase patient comfort.\n\nIn addition to official NHS charities, many other charities raise funds that are spent through the NHS, particularly in connection with medical research and capital appeals.\n\nRegional lotteries were also common for fundraising, and in 1988, a National Health Service Lottery was approved by the government, before being found illegal. The idea continued to become the National Lottery.[83]\n\nOutsourcing and privatisation [ edit ]\n\nAlthough the NHS routinely outsources the equipment and products that it uses and dentistry, eye care, pharmacy and most GP practices are provided by the private sector, the outsourcing of hospital health care has always been controversial.[84] The involvement of private companies regularly draws the suspicion of NHS staff,[85] the media and the public.[86][87]\n\nOutsourcing and privatisation has increased in recent years, with NHS spending to the private sector rose from £4.1 billion in 2009–10 to £8.7 billion in 2015–16.[88] The King's Fund's January 2015 report on the Coalition Government's 2012 reforms concluded that while marketisation had increased, claims of mass privatisation were exaggerated.[89] Private firms provide services in areas such as community service, general practise and mental health care. An article in The Independent suggested that the private sector tends to choose to deliver the services that are the most profitable, additionally because the private sector does not have intensive care facilities if things go wrong.[90]\n\nSustainability and transformation plans [ edit ]\n\nSustainability and transformation plans were produced during 2016 as a method of dealing with the service's financial problems. These plans appear to involve loss of services and are highly controversial. The plans are possibly the most far reaching change to health services for decades and the plans should contribute to redesigning care to manage increased patient demand. Some A&E units will close, concentrating hospital care in fewer places.[91] Nearly two thirds of senior doctors fear the plans will worsen patient care.[92]\n\nConsultation will start over cost saving, streamlining and some service reduction in the National Health Service. The streamlining will lead to ward closures including psychiatric ward closures and reduction in the number of beds in many areas among other changes. There is concern that hospital beds are being closed without increased community provision.[93]\n\nSally Gainsbury of the Nuffield Trust think tank said many current transformation plans involve shifting or closing services. Gainsbury added, \"Our research finds that, in a lot of these kinds of reconfigurations, you don't save very much money – all that happens is the patient has to go to the next hospital down the road. They're more inconvenienced... but it rarely saves the money that's needed.\"[94] By contrast, NHS England claims that the plans bring joined-up care closer to home. Senior Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb accepted that the review made sense in principle but stated: \"It would be scandalous if the government simply hoped to use these plans as an excuse to cut services and starve the NHS of the funding it desperately needs. While it is important that the NHS becomes more efficient and sustainable for future generations, redesign of care models will only get us so far – and no experts believe the Conservative doctrine that an extra £8bn funding by 2020 will be anywhere near enough.\"[95]\n\nWhistleblowing [ edit ]\n\nIn an independent review in 2016 by Robert Francis, it was concluded that some staff in England felt unable or unwilling to raise concerns about standards of care due to fear or low expectations, and that some staff who raised concerns had bad experiences and suffered unjustifiable consequences which the report described as \"shocking\".[96]: 86 There is a culture of bullying towards those who raise concerns.[96]: 87 This response may consist of placing the whistleblower on performance review, providing no assistance to them, starting a review process that can take months or years, possibly leading to mental health problems, and bullying and victimisation by other staff.[96]: 56 This process rarely ended with being redeployed in an organisation, instead resulting in retirement, dismissal, or alternative employment.[96]: 63\n\nAn issue identified by the report was the use of \"gagging clauses\" involved in settlements surrounding the termination of employment of those who whistleblow. While the report found that all the contracts were legal, it noted that the language used was often complicated and legalistic, a culture of fear deterred public interest disclosures even when they were not in breach of contract, and that the terms were often unnecessarily restrictive, for example by making the existence of the agreement confidential.[96]: 187\n\nSurgeon Peter Duffy wrote about his experiences of whistleblowing following an avoidable death in an independently published book, Whistle In the Wind.[97]\n\nIn research from BMA, 81% of respondents (NHS workers) believed they were only partly or not at all protected during the third wave.[98] BMA also stated that the British government were unprepared for the Covid-19 outbreak and that the underfunding of the NHS left the UK 'Brutally exposed' with 'too few staff and too few beds'.[99] One Doctor even claimed, regarding masks '\"We made our own and bought our own when we could find any—we depended on friends sourcing FFP3 masks, my son’s school 3D printing visors,\".[98] This research revealed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, NHS employees believed the government had treated them unjustly. The report they released was also believed to be the first of its kind to be ever done where researchers go to the doctors themselves in regard to policy-making during the COVID-19 pandemic.[100]\n\nNHS policies and programmes [ edit ]\n\nChanges under the Thatcher government [ edit ]\n\nThe 1980s saw the introduction of modern management processes (General Management) in the NHS to replace the previous system of consensus management. This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983.[101] This recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional £101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced a review of the NHS. From this review in 1989 two white papers Working for Patients and Caring for People were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the internal market, which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade.\n\nIn England, the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 defined this \"internal market\", whereby health authorities ceased to run hospitals but \"purchased\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals. Certain GPs became \"fund holders\" and were able to purchase care for their patients. The \"providers\" became independent trusts, which encouraged competition but also increased local differences. Increasing competition may have been statistically associated with poor patient outcomes.[102]\n\nChanges under the Blair government [ edit ]\n\nThese innovations, especially the \"fund holder\" option, were condemned at the time by the Labour Party. Opposition to what was claimed to be the Conservative intention to privatise the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns.[citation needed]\n\nLabour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \"internal market\" and abolish fundholding. However, in his second term Blair renounced this direction. He pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \"modernise\" the NHS.[citation needed]\n\nA number of factors drove these reforms; they include the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to improve standards and \"patient choice\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. (Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. See NHS Wales and NHS Scotland for descriptions of their developments).\n\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed service standards, strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of \"fundholding\" (under the description \"practice-based commissioning\"), closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous clinical and corporate governance. Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including NHS Direct. The Agenda for Change agreement aimed to provide harmonised pay and career progression. These changes have given rise to controversy within the medical professions, the news media and the public. The British Medical Association in a 2009 document on Independent Sector Treatment Centres (ISTCs) urged the government to restore the NHS to a service based on public provision, not private ownership; co-operation, not competition; integration, not fragmentation; and public service, not private profits.[103]\n\nThe Blair government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the Private Finance Initiative, an increasing number of hospitals were built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services such as ISTCs[104] and non-medical services such as catering provided under long-term contracts by the private sector. A study by a consultancy company for the Department of Health shows that every £200 million spent on privately financed hospitals will result in the loss of 1000 doctors and nurses.[citation needed] The first PFI hospitals contain some 28 per cent fewer beds than the ones they replaced.[105]\n\nThe NHS was also required to take on pro-active socially \"directive\" policies, for example, in respect of smoking and obesity.\n\nInformation technology [ edit ]\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s, NHS IT spent money on several failed IT projects. The Wessex project, in the 1980s, attempted to standardise IT systems across a regional health authority. The London Ambulance Service was to be a computer-aided dispatch system. Read code was an attempt to develop a new electronic language of health,[106] later scheduled to be replaced by SNOMED CT.\n\nThe NHS Information Authority (NHSIA) was established by an Act of Parliament in 1999 with the goal to bring together four NHS IT and Information bodies (NHS Telecoms, Family Health Service (FHS), NHS Centre for Coding and Classification (CCC) and NHS Information Management Group (IMG)) to work together to deliver IT infrastructure and information solutions to the NHS in England. A 2002 plan was for NHSIA to implement four national IT projects: Basic infrastructure, Electronic records, Electronic prescribing, and Electronic booking, modelled after the large NHS Direct tele-nurse and healthcare website program.[106] The NHSIA functions were divided into other organisations by April 2005.\n\nIn 2002, the NHS National Programme for IT (NPfIT) was announced by the Department of Health. It was widely seen as a failure, and blamed for delaying the implementation of IT in the service. Even in 2020 it appeared most of the 1.38 million NHS computers were still using Windows 7, which was released in 2009, and additional support had to be arranged by Microsoft until 14 January 2021 before the migration to Windows 10 could be completed. NHSX, the organisation set up to manage NHS information technology was supervising the migration, and has the power to impose sanctions on laggards.[107]\n\nDespite problems with internal IT programmes, the NHS has broken new ground in providing health information to the public via the internet. In June 2007 www.nhs.uk was relaunched under the banner \"NHS Choices\"[108] as a comprehensive health information service for the public now known simply as \"The NHS Website\".\n\nIn a break with the norm for government sites, www.nhs.uk allows users to add public comments giving their views on individual hospitals and to add comments to the articles it carries. It also enables users to compare hospitals for treatment via a \"scorecard\".[109] In April 2009 it became the first official site to publish hospital death rates (Hospital Standardised Mortality Rates) for the whole of England. Its Behind the Headlines daily health news analysis service,[110] which critically appraises media stories and the science behind them, was declared Best Innovation in Medical Communication in the prestigious BMJ Group Awards 2009.[111] and in a 2015 case study was found to provide highly accurate and detailed information when compared to other sources[112] In 2012, NHS England launched the NHS Apps Library, listing apps that had been reviewed by clinicians.[113]\n\nIn 2018, the NHS announced they would abandon the name NHS Choices, and in future, call the site the NHS website. This coincided with the launch of the NHS app.[114]\n\nEleven of the NHS hospitals in the West London Cancer Network were linked using the IOCOM Grid System in 2009. This helped increase collaboration and meeting attendance and even improved clinical decisions.[115]\n\nTwenty-one different electronic systems were used in the NHS in England to record data on patients in 2019. These systems do not communicate well with each other so there is a risk doctors treating a patient will not know everything they need to know to treat the patient effectively. There were 11 million patient interactions out of 121 million where information from a previous visit could not be accessed. Half the Trusts using Electronic Medical Records used one of three systems and at least those three should be able to share information. A tenth of Trusts used multiple systems in the same hospital. Leigh Warren who participated in the research said, \"Hospitals and GPs often don't have the right information about the right patient in the right place at the right time. This can lead to errors and accidents that can threaten patients' lives.\"[116]\n\nIn February 2022 Sajid Javid declared that at least 90% of NHS trusts should have electronic patient record systems by the end of 2023 and that the remaining 10% of trusts without them must be in the implementation phase by December 2023. He wants 80% of social care providers to have a digital record in place by March 2024. He also said he wanted 75% of adults in England to have downloaded the NHS App by March 2024.[117]\n\nSale of data [ edit ]\n\nInformation on millions of NHS patients in England was sold to international pharmaceutical companies, in the US and other nations for research, adding to concerns over USA ambitions to access remunerative parts of the NHS after Brexit. There is concern over lack of transparency and clarity over the data and how it is used. Phil Booth of medConfidential , campaigning for privacy of health data, said: \"Patients should know how their data is used. There should be no surprises. While legitimate research for public health benefit is to be encouraged, it must always be consensual, safe and properly transparent. Do patients know – have they even been told by the one in seven GP practices across England that pass on their clinical details – that their medical histories are being sold to multinational pharma companies in the US and around the world?\"[118]\n\nSurgery [ edit ]\n\nWaiting times for routine surgery have fallen substantially since 2000. As of July 2019, the median wait for planned care in England is under 8 weeks. The number of people waiting over 12 months has fallen from over 200,000 in the 1980s to under 2000 in 2019.[119] However the number of patients on the waiting list has risen recently as constrained funding, hospital beds and staffing growth has not kept up with increasing patient need.[120]\n\nSmoking cessation [ edit ]\n\nSmoking is the greatest cause of avoidable illness and death in England, and costs the NHS £2.5 billion a year and the economy £11bn.[121] Public Health England (PHE) states that one in four hospital patients smoke tobacco products, higher than the proportion in the general population, and smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses. PHE wants hospitals to help smokers quit. Few patients who smoke are referred to a hospital or community based cessation programme. During their hospital stay, over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop. PHE states smoking patients should be offered specialised help to stop and nicotine replacement therapy. Frank Ryan, a psychologist said, \"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit. And of course, whatever investment we make in smoking cessation programmes, there's a payback many times more in terms of the health benefits and even factors such as attendance at work, because it's workers who smoke [who] tend to have more absent spells from work.\"[122] The numbers of smokers getting help to quit has fallen due to cuts in funding for smoking cessation care, though the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends such help.[121]\n\nPublic satisfaction and criticism [ edit ]\n\nA 2016 survey by Ipsos MORI found that the NHS tops the list of \"things that makes us most proud to be British\" at 48%.[123] An independent survey conducted in 2004 found that users of the NHS often expressed very high levels of satisfaction about their personal experience of the medical services. Of hospital inpatients, 92% said they were satisfied with their treatment; 87% of GP users were satisfied with their GP; 87% of hospital outpatients were satisfied with the service they received; and 70% of Accident and Emergency department users reported being satisfied.[124] Despite this some patients complain about being unable to see a GP at once when they feel their condition requires prompt attention.[125] When asked whether they agreed with the question \"My local NHS is providing me with a good service\" 67% of those surveyed agreed with it, and 51% agreed with the statement \"The NHS is providing a good service.\"[124] The reason for this disparity between personal experience and overall perceptions is not clear; however, researchers at King's College London found high-profile media spectacles may function as part of a wider 'blame business', in which the media, lawyers and regulators have vested interests.[126][127] The survey found that most people believe that the national press is generally critical of the service (64% reporting it as being critical compared to just 13% saying the national press is favourable), and also that the national press is the least reliable source of information (50% rating it not very or not at all reliable, compared to 36% believing the press was reliable) .[124] Newspapers were reported as being less favourable and also less reliable than the broadcast media. The most reliable sources of information were considered leaflets from GPs and information from friends (both 77% reported as reliable) and medical professionals (75% considered reliable).[124]\n\nSome examples of criticism include:\n\nSome extremely expensive treatments may be available in some areas but not in others, the so-called postcode lottery.[128] The National Programme for IT, which was designed to provide infrastructure for electronic prescribing, booking appointments and elective surgery, and a national care records service. The programme ran into delays and overspends before it was finally abandoned. In 2008 there was a decreasing availability of NHS dentistry following a new government contract[129] and a trend towards dentists accepting private patients only,[130] with 1 in 10 dentists having left the NHS totally. However, in 2014 the number of NHS dental patients increased.[131] There have been a number of high-profile scandals within the NHS. Most recently there have been scandals at acute hospitals such as Alder Hey and the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Stafford Hospital is currently under investigation for poor conditions and inadequacies that statistical analysis has shown caused excess deaths. A 14 October 2008 article in The Daily Telegraph stated: \"An NHS trust has spent more than £12,000 on private treatment for hospital staff because its own waiting times are too long.\"[132] The NHS has been criticised in the past for funding homeopathic medicines, which are not supported by scientific research. £4 million of funding was given in 2010.[133] The NHS ceased funding homeopathy in 2017.[134] The absence of identity/residence checks on patients at clinics and hospitals allows people who ordinarily reside overseas to travel to the UK for the purpose of obtaining free treatment, at the expense of the UK taxpayer. A report published in 2007 estimates that the NHS bill for treatment of so-called 'health tourists' was £30m, 0.03% of the total cost.[135] Negative media coverage about the NHS commonly focuses on staff shortages and the consequences on patients' health and care.[136][137][138]\n\nIn November 2022 a survey by Ipsos and the Health Foundation found just 8% of people surveyed in England thought the government plans for the NHS were appropriate.[139]\n\nQuality of healthcare, and accreditation [ edit ]\n\nThere are many regulatory bodies with a role in the NHS, both government-based (e.g., Department of Health and Social Care, General Medical Council, Nursing and Midwifery Council),and non-governmental-based (e.g., Royal Colleges). Independent accreditation groups exist within the UK, such as the public sector Trent Accreditation Scheme and the private sector CHKS.\n\nWith respect to assessing, maintaining and improving the quality of healthcare, in common with many other developed countries, the UK government has separated the roles of suppliers of healthcare and assessors of the quality of its delivery. Quality is assessed by independent bodies such as the Healthcare Commission according to standards set by the Department of Health and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Responsibility for assessing quality transferred to the Care Quality Commission in April 2009.\n\n700 hospital patients suffered harm in serious incidents due to treatment delays in part of 2015–16, 1,027 hospital patients suffered similar harm in 2016-17 and this rose to 1,515 in 2017–18. Norman Lamb blames understaffing. NHS Improvement stated during 2017-18 the NHS was short of 93,000 staff, which included 10,000 doctors and 37,000 nurses.[140]\n\nPerformance [ edit ]\n\nIn 2014 the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation produced a report comparing the performance of the NHS in the four countries of the UK since devolution in 1999. They included data for the North East of England as an area more similar to the devolved areas than the rest of England. They found that there was little evidence that any one country was moving ahead of the others consistently across the available indicators of performance. There had been improvements in all four countries in life expectancy and in rates of mortality amenable to health care. Despite the hotly contested policy differences between the four countries there was little evidence, where there was comparable data, of any significant differences in outcomes. The authors also complained about the increasingly limited set of comparable data on the four health systems of the UK.[141] Medical school places are set to increase by 25% from 2018.[142]\n\nA report from Public Health England's Neurology Intelligence Network based on hospital outpatient data for 2012–13 showed that there was significant variation in access to services by clinical commissioning group. In some places there was no access at all to consultant neurologists or nurses. The number of new consultant adult neurology outpatient appointments varied between 2,531 per 100,000 resident population in Camden to 165 per 100,000 in Doncaster.[143]\n\nFollowing the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a dramatic increase in the backlog of people waiting for treatment.[144] The BMI said \"the backlog in secondary care consists of the care that the NHS would normally have delivered but which was disrupted as COVID-19 impacted service delivery\".[144] In December 2022 over 7 million people were on a hospital waiting list in England, 1 in 8 English people. Many had waited for months.[145] This was the largest number since the start of records. 37,837 patients waited over 12 hours for hospital admission after it had been decided to admit them in November 2022, 255% more than in 2021 and 3,303% more than in November 2019.[49]\n\nMental health services [ edit ]\n\nThe NHS provides mental health services free of charge, but normally requires a referral from a GP first. Services that do not need a referral include psychological therapies through the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies initiative, and treatment for those with drug and alcohol problems. The NHS also provides online services that help patients find the resources most relevant to their needs.[146]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]\n\nE\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS) collection information system.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the Cardiovascular disease prevention audit Directions 2020.\n\nThe retrospective audit of data for mesh procedures data analysis Directions 2018.\n\nNHS England has directed NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as citizen identity services.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the 111 winter collection.\n\nDirections given by NHS England for the collection of information to be known as the general practice contract data collections data collection system.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the genetic testing rates information system.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the GP appointments data collection.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the GP workload collection information system.\n\nNHS England has directed NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Data Collection Information System.\n\nNHS England has directed NHS Digital to establish a system for collection of data from all Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Long-Term Conditions (LTC) wave 1 and wave 2 providers in England taking part in the Integrated Health Pilot.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the maternity services information system.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the mental health services information system.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the national audit of pulmonary hypertension information system.\n\nDirections to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the NHS Services: NHS 111 Online Directions 2017.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the NHS App Direction 2018.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the personal health budgets collection information system.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the serious mental illness data collection Direction 2018\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the learning disabilities observatories GPES extract data collection.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate systems for the collection and analysis of information systems for NHS Services: 111 Coronavirus daily sitrep data.\n\nDirections given by NHS England requiring NHS Digital to establish and operate a system for the collection of information to be known as the EU Exit Sitrep Data Collection Directions 2019."], "label": "S", "category": "ExpertQA", "additional_info": ""}

Permissive parenting induces a higher probability of low self-esteem, educational difficulties, school delinquency, and substance use in children [109]. Conversely, strong parental support and autonomy as depicted by authoritative parenting leads to higher self-esteem and life satisfaction, lower depression [28, 44, 88, 93, 100], and positively impacts adolescents’ educational achievement [56]. Permissive parenting potentially increases the likelihood of engaging in impulsive behaviours such as alcohol abuse [6]; risky sexual behaviour especially among females [38]; and heightened display of disruptive behaviours by males [105] due to the lack of parental behaviour control [121].

By Mayo Clinic Staff\n\nHigh cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease and heart attacks. Medications can help improve your cholesterol. But if you'd rather first make lifestyle changes to improve your cholesterol, try these five healthy changes.\n\nIf you already take medications, these changes can improve their cholesterol-lowering effect.\n\n1. Eat heart-healthy foods\n\nA few changes in your diet can reduce cholesterol and improve your heart health:\n\nReduce saturated fats. Saturated fats, found primarily in red meat and full-fat dairy products, raise your total cholesterol. Decreasing your consumption of saturated fats can reduce your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol.\n\nSaturated fats, found primarily in red meat and full-fat dairy products, raise your total cholesterol. Decreasing your consumption of saturated fats can reduce your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol. Eliminate trans fats. Trans fats, sometimes listed on food labels as \"partially hydrogenated vegetable oil,\" are often used in margarines and store-bought cookies, crackers and cakes. Trans fats raise overall cholesterol levels. The Food and Drug Administration has banned the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils by Jan. 1, 2021.\n\nTrans fats, sometimes listed on food labels as \"partially hydrogenated vegetable oil,\" are often used in margarines and store-bought cookies, crackers and cakes. Trans fats raise overall cholesterol levels. The Food and Drug Administration has banned the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils by Jan. 1, 2021. Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids don't affect LDL cholesterol. But they have other heart-healthy benefits, including reducing blood pressure. Foods with omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, mackerel, herring, walnuts and flaxseeds.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids don't affect cholesterol. But they have other heart-healthy benefits, including reducing blood pressure. Foods with omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, mackerel, herring, walnuts and flaxseeds. Increase soluble fiber. Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. Soluble fiber is found in such foods as oatmeal, kidney beans, Brussels sprouts, apples and pears.\n\nSoluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. Soluble fiber is found in such foods as oatmeal, kidney beans, Brussels sprouts, apples and pears. Add whey protein. Whey protein, which is found in dairy products, may account for many of the health benefits attributed to dairy. Studies have shown that whey protein given as a supplement lowers both LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol as well as blood pressure.\n\n2. Exercise on most days of the week and increase your physical activity\n\nExercise can improve cholesterol. Moderate physical activity can help raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the \"good\" cholesterol. With your doctor's OK, work up to at least 30 minutes of exercise five times a week or vigorous aerobic activity for 20 minutes three times a week.\n\nAdding physical activity, even in short intervals several times a day, can help you begin to lose weight. Consider:\n\nTaking a brisk daily walk during your lunch hour\n\nRiding your bike to work\n\nPlaying a favorite sport\n\nTo stay motivated, consider finding an exercise buddy or joining an exercise group.\n\n3. Quit smoking\n\nQuitting smoking improves your HDL cholesterol level. The benefits occur quickly:\n\nWithin 20 minutes of quitting, your blood pressure and heart rate recover from the cigarette-induced spike\n\nWithin three months of quitting, your blood circulation and lung function begin to improve\n\nWithin a year of quitting, your risk of heart disease is half that of a smoker\n\n4. Lose weight\n\nCarrying even a few extra pounds contributes to high cholesterol. Small changes add up. If you drink sugary beverages, switch to tap water. Snack on air-popped popcorn or pretzels — but keep track of the calories. If you crave something sweet, try sherbet or candies with little or no fat, such as jelly beans.\n\nLook for ways to incorporate more activity into your daily routine, such as using the stairs instead of taking the elevator or parking farther from your office. Take walks during breaks at work. Try to increase standing activities, such as cooking or doing yardwork.\n\n5. Drink alcohol only in moderation\n\nModerate use of alcohol has been linked with higher levels of HDL cholesterol — but the benefits aren't strong enough to recommend alcohol for anyone who doesn't already drink.\n\nIf you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.\n\nToo much alcohol can lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, heart failure and strokes.\n\nIf lifestyle changes aren't enough …\n\nSometimes healthy lifestyle changes aren't enough to lower cholesterol levels. If your doctor recommends medication to help lower your cholesterol, take it as prescribed while continuing your lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes can help you keep your medication dose low.\n\nThere is a problem with information submitted for this request. Review/update the information highlighted below and resubmit the form.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Some of these currencies are shared by several countries, such as the **West African CFA franc**.", "reference_documents": ["If you're planning a trip to Africa, you'll need to find out the local currency for your destination and plan the best way to manage your money while you're there. Most African countries have their own unique currency, although some share the same currency with several other states. The West African CFC franc, for example, is the official currency of eight countries in West Africa, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo.\n\nSimilarly, some African countries have more than one official currency. The South African rand is used alongside the Namibian dollar in Namibia, and alongside the Swazi Lilangeni in Swaziland.\n\nEric Lafforgue/Art in All of Us / Contributor / Getty Images\n\nExchange Rates\n\nExchange rates for many African currencies are volatile, so it's usually best to wait until you arrive before exchanging your foreign cash into local money. Often, the cheapest way to obtain local currency is to draw it directly from the ATM, rather than paying commission at airport bureaus or city exchange centers. If you prefer to exchange cash, convert a small amount upon arrival (enough to pay for transport from the airport to your initial hotel), then exchange the rest in town where it's cheaper. Make sure to download a currency converter app, or use a website like this one to double check the latest exchange rates before agreeing to a fee.\n\nLee Frost / robertharding / Getty Images\n\nCash, Cards or Traveler's Cheques?\n\nTraveler's cheques are outdated and very rarely accepted in Africa, especially in rural areas. Both cash and cards have their own set of pros and cons. Carrying large amounts of cash on your person is inadvisable in Africa from a safety perspective, and unless your hotel has a trustworthy safe, it's not a good idea to leave it in your hotel room either. If possible, leave the majority of your money in the bank, using an ATM to draw it in small installments as required. However, while cities in countries like Egypt and South Africa have a wealth of ATMs, you may be hard-pressed to find one in a remote safari camp or on a tiny Indian Ocean island. If you're traveling to places where ATMs are either unreliable or non-existent, you'll need to draw the cash that you intend on spending in advance. Wherever you go, it's a good idea to carry coins or small notes for tipping the slew of people that you'll meet on your journey, from car guards to gas station attendants.\n\nWestend61/Getty Images\n\nMoney & Safety in Africa\n\nSo, if you're forced to draw large amounts of cash, how do you keep it safe? Your best bet is to split your cash, keeping it in several different locations (one rolled up in a sock in your main luggage, one in a secret compartment in your backpack, one in a hotel safe etc). In this way, if one bag is stolen, you'll still have the other cash stashes to fall back on. Don't carry your wallet in an oversized, obvious purse—instead, invest in a money belt or keep notes folded in a zipped pocket instead. If you decide to go the card route, be very aware of your surroundings at ATMs. Choose one in a safe, well-lit area, and make sure not to let anyone stand close enough to see your PIN. Be aware of con artists offering to help you make your withdrawal, or asking you for help making theirs. If someone approaches you while you're drawing money, be careful that they're not acting as a distraction while someone else seizes your cash. Staying safe in Africa is easy—but common sense is essential.\n\nAfricaImages/Getty Images\n\nOfficial African Currencies\n\nAlgeria: Algerian dinar (DZD)\n\nAngola: Angolan kwanza (AOA)\n\nBenin: West African CFA franc (XOF)\n\nBotswana: Botswanan pula (BWP)\n\nBurkina Faso: West African CFA franc (XOF)\n\nBurundi: Burundian franc (BIF)\n\nCameroon: Central African CFA franc (XAF)\n\nCape Verde: Cape Verdian escudo (CVE)\n\nCentral African Republic: Central African CFA franc (XAF)\n\nChad: Central African CFA franc (XAF)\n\nComoros: Comorian franc (KMF)\n\nCote d'Ivoire: West African CFA franc (XOF)\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo: Congolese franc (CDF), Zairean zaire (ZRZ)\n\nDjibouti: Djiboutian franc (DJF)\n\nEgypt: Egyptian pound (EGP)\n\nEquatorial Guinea: Central African CFA franc (XAF)\n\nEritrea: Eritrean nakfa (ERN)\n\nEthiopia: Ethiopian birr (ETB)\n\nGabon: Central African CFA franc (XAF)\n\nGambia: Gambian dalasi (GMD)\n\nGhana: Ghanaian cedi (GHS)\n\nGuinea: Guinean franc (GNF)\n\nGuinea-Bissau: West African CFA franc (XOF)\n\nKenya: Kenyan shilling (KES)\n\nLesotho: Lesotho loti (LSL)\n\nLiberia: Liberian dollar (LRD)\n\nLibya: Libyan dinar (LYD)\n\nMadagascar: Malagasy ariary (MGA)\n\nMalawi: Malawian kwacha (MWK)\n\nMali: West African CFA franc (XOF)\n\nMauritania: Mauritanian ouguiya (MRO)\n\nMauritius: Mauritian rupee (MUR)\n\nMorocco: Moroccan dirham (MAD)\n\nMozambique: Mozambican metical (MZN)\n\nNamibia: Namibian dollar (NAD), South African rand (ZAR)\n\nNiger: West African CFA franc (XOF)\n\nNigeria: Nigerian naira (NGN)\n\nRepublic of the Congo: Central African CFA franc (XAF)\n\nRwanda: Rwandan franc (RWF)\n\nSao Tome and Principe: São Tomé and Príncipe dobra (STD)\n\nSenegal: West African CFA franc (XOF)\n\nSeychelles: Seychellois rupee (SCR)\n\nSierra Leone: Sierra Leonean leone (SLL)\n\nSomalia: Somali shilling (SOS)\n\nSouth Africa: South African rand (ZAR)\n\nSudan: Sudanese pound (SDG)\n\nSouth Sudan: South Sudanese pound (SSP)\n\nSwaziland: Swazi Lilangeni (SZL), South African rand (ZAR)\n\nTanzania: Tanzanian shilling (TZS)\n\nTogo: West African CFA franc (XOF)\n\nTunisia: Tunisian dinar (TND)\n\nUganda: Ugandan shilling (UGX)\n\nZambia: Zambian kwacha (ZMK)\n\nZimbabwe: United States dollar (USD), South African rand (ZAR), Euro (EUR), Indian rupee (INR), Pound sterling (GBP), Chinese yuan/ Renminbi (CNY), Botswanan pula (BWP)"], "label": "S", "category": "ExpertQA", "additional_info": ""}

For other uses, see Contraception (disambiguation)\n\nBirth control, also known as contraception, anticonception, and fertility control, is the use of methods or devices to prevent unintended pregnancy.[1] Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century.[2] Planning, making available, and using human birth control is called family planning.[3][4] Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.[2]\n\nThe World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide guidance on the safety of birth control methods among women with specific medical conditions.[5][6] The most effective methods of birth control are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control.[7] This is followed by a number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections.[7] Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods.[7] The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation.[7] Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them.[7] Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections.[8] Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.[9] Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex.[10][11] Some argue not having sex is also a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.[12][13]\n\nIn teenagers, pregnancies are at greater risk of poor outcomes.[14] Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control decreases the rate of unintended pregnancies in this age group.[14][15] While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people,[16] long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy.[15] After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks.[16] Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months.[16] In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills.[16] In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last menstrual period.[16]\n\nAbout 222 million women who want to avoid pregnancy in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method.[17][18] Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met.[19][20] By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children.[19] In the developing world, women's earnings, assets, and weight, as well as their children's schooling and health, all improve with greater access to birth control.[21] Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.[21][22]\n\nVideo explaining how to prevent unwanted pregnancy\n\nMethods [ edit ]\n\nChance of pregnancy during first year of use[23][24] Method Typical use Perfect use No birth control 85% 85% Combination pill 9% 0.3% Progestin-only pill 13% 1.1% Sterilization (female) 0.5% 0.5% Sterilization (male) 0.15% 0.1% Condom (female) 21% 5% Condom (male) 18% 2% Copper IUD 0.8% 0.6% Hormonal IUD 0.2% 0.2% Patch 9% 0.3% Vaginal ring 9% 0.3% MPA shot 6% 0.2% Implant 0.05% 0.05% Diaphragm and spermicide 12% 6% Fertility awareness 24% 0.4–5% Withdrawal 22% 4% Lactational amenorrhea method\n\n(6 months failure rate) 0–7.5%[25] <2%[26]\n\nBirth control methods include barrier methods, hormonal birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods.

Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year,[27] and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal ligation.[28]\n\nThe most effective methods are those that are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits.[29] Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%.[23] Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if adhered to strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%.[29] With typical use, first-year failure rates are considerably higher, at 9%, due to inconsistent use.[23] Other methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage.[29] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young individuals.[30]\n\nWhile all methods of birth control have some potential adverse effects, the risk is less than that of pregnancy.[29] After stopping or removing many methods of birth control, including oral contraceptives, IUDs, implants and injections, the rate of pregnancy during the subsequent year is the same as for those who used no birth control.[31]\n\nFor individuals with specific health problems, certain forms of birth control may require further investigations.[32] For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam—including birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms.[33] For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills does not appear to affect outcomes.[34][35][36] In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control.[32]\n\nHormonal [ edit ]\n\nHormonal contraception is available in a number of different forms, including oral pills, implants under the skin, injections, patches, IUDs and a vaginal ring. They are currently available only for women, although hormonal contraceptives for men have been and are being clinically tested.[37] There are two types of oral birth control pills, the combined oral contraceptive pills (which contain both estrogen and a progestin) and the progestogen-only pills (sometimes called minipills).[38] If either is taken during pregnancy, they do not increase the risk of miscarriage nor cause birth defects.[35] Both types of birth control pills prevent fertilization mainly by inhibiting ovulation and thickening cervical mucus.[39][40] They may also change the lining of the uterus and thus decrease implantation.[40] Their effectiveness depends on the user's adherence to taking the pills.[35]\n\nCombined hormonal contraceptives are associated with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots.[41] Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years[42] which is still less than that associated with pregnancy.[41] Due to this risk, they are not recommended in women over 35 years of age who continue to smoke.[43] Due to the increased risk, they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.[44]\n\nThe effect on sexual drive is varied, with increase or decrease in some but with no effect in most.[45] Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer.[46][47] They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps.[35] The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.[46]\n\nProgestin-only pills, injections and intrauterine devices are not associated with an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with a history of blood clots in their veins.[41][48] In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used.[41] Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods.[49] The progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line.[50] The perfect use first-year failure rate of injectable progestin is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.[23]\n\nBarrier [ edit ]\n\nBarrier contraceptives are devices that attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the uterus.[51] They include male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges with spermicide.[51]\n\nGlobally, condoms are the most common method of birth control.[52] Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and physically block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner.[53] Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine.[53] Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane.[54] Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects.[55] Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency.[56] In Japan, about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%,[57] and in the United States it is 18%.[58]\n\nMale condoms and the diaphragm with spermicide have typical use first-year failure rates of 18% and 12%, respectively.[23] With perfect use condoms are more effective with a 2% first-year failure rate versus a 6% first-year rate with the diaphragm.[23] Condoms have the additional benefit of helping to prevent the spread of some sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS, however, condoms made from animal intestine do not.[7][59]\n\nContraceptive sponges combine a barrier with a spermicide.[29] Like diaphragms, they are inserted vaginally before intercourse and must be placed over the cervix to be effective.[29] Typical failure rates during the first year depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not.[23] The sponge can be inserted up to 24 hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward.[29] Allergic reactions[60] and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.[61]\n\nIntrauterine devices [ edit ]\n\nCopper T shaped IUD with removal strings\n\nThe current intrauterine devices (IUD) are small devices, often 'T'-shaped, containing either copper or levonorgestrel, which are inserted into the uterus. They are one form of long-acting reversible contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth control.[62] Failure rates with the copper IUD is about 0.8% while the levonorgestrel IUD has a failure rates of 0.2% in the first year of use.[63] Among types of birth control, they, along with birth control implants, result in the greatest satisfaction among users.[64] As of 2007 , IUDs are the most widely used form of reversible contraception, with more than 180 million users worldwide.[65]\n\nEvidence supports effectiveness and safety in adolescents[64] and those who have and have not previously had children.[66] IUDs do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery.[67] They may also be used immediately after an abortion.[68][69] Once removed, even after long term use, fertility returns to normal immediately.[70]\n\nWhile copper IUDs may increase menstrual bleeding and result in more painful cramps,[71] hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether.[67] Cramping can be treated with painkillers like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.[72] Other potential complications include expulsion (2–5%) and rarely perforation of the uterus (less than 0.7%).[67][72] A previous model of the intrauterine device (the Dalkon shield) was associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease; however, the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion.[73] IUDs appear to decrease the risk of ovarian cancer.[74]\n\nSterilization [ edit ]\n\nTwo broad categories exist, surgical and non-surgical.\n\nSurgical sterilization is available in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men.[2] Tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer.[2] Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation.[2][75] After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in one or two weeks.[76] Chronic scrotal pain associated with negative impact on quality of life occurs after vasectomy in about 1-2% of men.[77] With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia.[78] Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.[2] Sometimes, salpingectomy is also used for sterilization in women.[79]\n\nNon-surgical sterilization methods have also been explored. Fahim [80][81][82] et al. found that heat exposure, especially high-intensity ultrasound, was effective either for temporary or permanent contraception depending on the dose, e.g. selective destruction of germ cells and Sertoli cells without affecting Leydig cells or testosterone levels. Chemical, e.g. drug-based methods are also available, e.g. orally-administered Lonidamine[83] for temporary, or permanent (depending on the dose) fertility management. Boris[84] provides a method for chemically inducing either temporary or non-reversible sterility, depending on the dose, \"Permanent sterility in human males can be obtained by a single oral dosage containing from about 18 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg\".\n\nThe permanence of this decision may cause regret in some men and women. Of women who have undergone tubal ligation after the age of 30, about 6% regret their decision, as compared with 20-24% of women who received sterilization within one year of delivery and before turning 30, and 6% in nulliparous women sterilized before the age of 30.[85] By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men who are more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage.[86] In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated they would not have had children if they were able to do it over again.[87]\n\nAlthough sterilization is considered a permanent procedure,[88] it is possible to attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women, the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse.[88] Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.[88] The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent.[89] Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the vasectomy and the reversal.[89] Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.[90]\n\nBehavioral [ edit ]\n\nBehavioral methods involve regulating the timing or method of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract, either altogether or when an egg may be present.[91] If used perfectly the first-year failure rate may be around 3.4%; however, if used poorly first-year failure rates may approach 85%.[92]\n\nFertility awareness [ edit ]\n\nA CycleBeads tool, used for estimating fertility based on days since last menstruation\n\nFertility awareness methods involve determining the most fertile days of the menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse.[91] Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature, cervical secretions, or the day of the cycle.[91] They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%.[23] The evidence on which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early.[91] Globally, they are used by about 3.6% of couples.[93] If based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. First-year failure rates of 20% overall and 0.4% for perfect use have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method.[94][23] A number of fertility tracking apps are available, as of 2016, but they are more commonly designed to assist those trying to get pregnant rather than prevent pregnancy.[95]\n\nWithdrawal [ edit ]\n\nThe withdrawal method (also known as coitus interruptus) is the practice of ending intercourse (\"pulling out\") before ejaculation.[96] The main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner.[96] First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage.[23] It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.[29]\n\nThere is little data regarding the sperm content of pre-ejaculatory fluid.[97] While some tentative research did not find sperm,[97] one trial found sperm present in 10 out of 27 volunteers.[98] The withdrawal method is used as birth control by about 3% of couples.[93]\n\nAbstinence [ edit ]\n\nSexual abstinence may be used as a form of birth control, meaning either not engaging in any type of sexual activity, or specifically not engaging in vaginal intercourse, while engaging in other forms of non-vaginal sex.[99][100] Complete sexual abstinence is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy.[101][102] However, among those who take a pledge to abstain from premarital sex, as many as 88% who engage in sex, do so prior to marriage.[103] The choice to abstain from sex cannot protect against pregnancy as a result of rape, and public health efforts emphasizing abstinence to reduce unwanted pregnancy may have limited effectiveness, especially in developing countries and among disadvantaged groups.[104][105]\n\nDeliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control.[99] While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex and other forms of penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.[106][107]\n\nAbstinence-only sex education does not reduce teenage pregnancy.[9][108] Teen pregnancy rates and STI rates are generally the same or higher in states where students are given abstinence-only education, as compared with comprehensive sex education.[108] Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup methods available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills).[109]\n\nLactation [ edit ]\n\nThe lactational amenorrhea method involves the use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding.[110] For a postpartum women to be infertile (protected from pregnancy), their periods have usually not yet returned (not menstruating), they are exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and the baby is younger than six months.[26] If breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition and the baby is less than 6 months old, 93-99% of women are estimated to have protection from becoming pregnant in the first six months (0.75-7.5% failure rate).[111][112] The failure rate increases to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years.[113] Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase the chances of becoming pregnant while breastfeeding.[114] In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months.[113] In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return as early as four weeks after delivery.[113]\n\nEmergency [ edit ]\n\nA split dose of two emergency contraceptive pills\n\nEmergency contraceptive methods are medications (sometimes misleadingly referred to as \"morning-after pills\")[115] or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse with the hope of preventing pregnancy. Emergency contraceptives are often given to victims of rape.[10] They work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization.[2][116] They are unlikely to affect implantation, but this has not been completely excluded.[116] A number of options exist, including high dose birth control pills, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, ulipristal and IUDs.[117] Providing emergency contraceptive pills to women in advance does not affect rates of sexually transmitted infections, condom use, pregnancy rates, or sexual risk-taking behavior.[118][119] All methods have minimal side effects.[117]\n\nLevonorgestrel pills, when used within 3 days, decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70% (resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2%).[10] Ulipristal, when used within 5 days, decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85% (pregnancy rate 1.4%) and is more effective than levonorgestrel.[10][117][120] Mifepristone is also more effective than levonorgestrel, while copper IUDs are the most effective method.[117] IUDs can be inserted up to five days after intercourse and prevent about 99% of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex (pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2%).[2][121] This makes them the most effective form of emergency contraceptive.[122] In those who are overweight or obese, levonorgestrel is less effective and an IUD or ulipristal is recommended.[123]\n\nDual protection [ edit ]\n\nDual protection is the use of methods that prevent both sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.[124] This can be with condoms either alone or along with another birth control method or by the avoidance of penetrative sex.[125][126]\n\nIf pregnancy is a high concern, using two methods at the same time is reasonable.[125] For example, two forms of birth control are recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin or anti-epileptic drugs like carbamazepine, due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy.[127][128]\n\nEffects [ edit ]\n\nHealth [ edit ]\n\nMaternal mortality rate as of 2010.[129]\n\nBirth control use and total fertility rate by region.\n\nContraceptive use in developing countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met.[19][20] These benefits are achieved by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.[19]\n\nBirth control also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies.[19] In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery.[19][130] Delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage, however, does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.[130]\n\nTeenage pregnancies, especially among younger teens, are at greater risk of adverse outcomes including early birth, low birth weight, and death of the infant.[14] In 2012 in the United States 82% of pregnancies in those between the ages of 15 and 19 years old are unplanned.[72] Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group.[131]\n\nBirth control methods, especially hormonal methods, can also have undesirable side effects. Intensity of side effects can range from minor to debilitating, and varies with individual experiences. These most commonly include change in menstruation regularity and flow, nausea, breast tenderness, headaches, weight gain, and mood changes (specifically an increase in depression and anxiety).[132][133] Additionally, hormonal contraception can contribute to bone mineral density loss, impaired glucose metabolism, increased risk of venous thromboembolism.[133][132] Comprehensive sex education and transparent discussion of birth control side effects and contraindications between healthcare provider and patient is imperative.[132]\n\nFinances [ edit ]\n\nMap of countries by fertility rate (2020)\n\nIn the developing world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children and thus more women participating in or increased contribution to the workforce - as they are usually the primary caregiver for children.[21] Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control.[21] Family planning, via the use of modern birth control, is one of the most cost-effective health interventions.[134] For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved.[18] These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses.[134] While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.[134]\n\nThe total medical cost for a pregnancy, delivery and care of a newborn in the United States is on average $21,000 for a vaginal delivery and $31,000 for a caesarean delivery as of 2012.[135] In most other countries, the cost is less than half.[135] For a child born in 2011, an average US family will spend $235,000 over 17 years to raise them.[136]\n\nPrevalence [ edit ]\n\nWorld map colored according to modern birth control use. Each shading level represents a range of six percentage points, with usage less than or equal to: 6% 12% 18% 24% 30% 36% 48% 60% 66% 78% 86% No data\n\nDemand for family planning satisfied by modern methods as of 2017.[137]\n\nGlobally, as of 2009, approximately 60% of those who are married and able to have children use birth control.[138] How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries.[138] The most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives, while in Africa it is oral contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization.[138] In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.[138]\n\nWhile less used in the developed countries than the developing world, the number of women using IUDs as of 2007 was more than 180 million.[65] Avoiding sex when fertile is used by about 3.6% of women of childbearing age, with usage as high as 20% in areas of South America.[139] As of 2005, 12% of couples are using a male form of birth control (either condoms or a vasectomy) with higher rates in the developed world.[140] Usage of male forms of birth control has decreased between 1985 and 2009.[138] Contraceptive use among women in Sub-Saharan Africa has risen from about 5% in 1991 to about 30% in 2006.[141]\n\nAs of 2012, 57% of women of childbearing age want to avoid pregnancy (867 of 1,520 million).[142] About 222 million women, however, were not able to access birth control, 53 million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97 million of whom were in Asia.[142] This results in 54 million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year.[138] Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons,[2] while another contributor is poverty.[143] Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.[143]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nEarly history [ edit ]\n\nAncient silver coin from Cyrene depicting a stalk of silphium\n\nThe Egyptian Ebers Papyrus from 1550 BC and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850 BC have within them some of the earliest documented descriptions of birth control: the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm.[144][145] Silphium, a species of giant fennel native to north Africa, may have been used as birth control in ancient Greece and the ancient Near East.[146][147] Due to its supposed desirability, by the first century AD, it had become so rare that it was worth more than its weight in silver and, by late antiquity, it was fully extinct.[146] Most methods of birth control used in antiquity were probably ineffective.[148]\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle ( c. 384–322 BC) recommended applying cedar oil to the womb before intercourse, a method which was probably only effective on occasion.[148] A Hippocratic text On the Nature of Women recommended that a woman drink a copper salt dissolved in water, which it claimed would prevent pregnancy for a year.[148] This method was not only ineffective, but also dangerous, as the later medical writer Soranus of Ephesus ( c. 98–138 AD) pointed out.[148] Soranus attempted to list reliable methods of birth control based on rational principles.[148] He rejected the use of superstition and amulets and instead prescribed mechanical methods such as vaginal plugs and pessaries using wool as a base covered in oils or other gummy substances.[148] Many of Soranus's methods were probably also ineffective.[148]\n\nIn medieval Europe, any effort to halt pregnancy was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church,[144] although it is believed that women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina.[149] Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy.[150] The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640.[150] They were made of animal gut, and were most likely used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War.[150] Casanova, living in 18th-century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.[144]\n\nBirth control movement [ edit ]\n\n\"And the villain still pursues her\", a satirical Victorian era postcard\n\nThe birth control movement developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries.[151] The Malthusian League, based on the ideas of Thomas Malthus, was established in 1877 in the United Kingdom to educate the public about the importance of family planning and to advocate for getting rid of penalties for promoting birth control.[152] It was founded during the \"Knowlton trial\" of Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh, who were prosecuted for publishing on various methods of birth control.[153]\n\nIn the United States, Margaret Sanger and Otto Bobsein popularized the phrase \"birth control\" in 1914.[154][155] Sanger primarily advocated for birth control on the idea that it would prevent women from seeking unsafe abortions, but during her lifetime, she began to campaign for it on the grounds that it would reduce mental and physical defects.[156][157] She was mainly active in the United States but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s. At the time, under the Comstock Law, distribution of birth control information was illegal. She jumped bail in 1914 after her arrest for distributing birth control information and left the United States for the United Kingdom.[158] In the U.K., Sanger, influenced by Havelock Ellis, further developed her arguments for birth control. She believed women needed to enjoy sex without fearing a pregnancy. During her time abroad, Sanger also saw a more flexible diaphragm in a Dutch clinic, which she thought was a better form of contraceptive.[157] Once Sanger returned to the United States, she established a short-lived birth-control clinic with the help of her sister, Ethel Bryne, based in the Brownville section of Brooklyn, New York[159] in 1916. It was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest.[160] The publicity surrounding the arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States.[161] Besides her sister, Sanger was helped in the movement by her first husband, William Sanger, who distributed copies of \"Family Limitation.\" Sanger's second husband, James Noah H. Slee, would also later become involved in the movement, acting as its main funder.[157] Sanger also contributed to the funding of research into hormonal contraceptives in the 1950s.[162] She helped fund research John Rock, and biologist Gregory Pincus that resulted in the first hormonal contraceptive pill, later called Enovid.[163] The first human trials of the pill were done on patients in the Worcester State Psychiatric Hospital, after which clinical testing was done in Puerto Rico before Enovid was approved for use in the U.S.. The people participating in these trials were not fully informed on the medical implications of the pill, and often had minimal to no other family planning options.[164][165] The newly approved birth control method was not made available to the participants after the trials, and contraceptives are still not widely accessible in Puerto Rico.[163]\n\nThe increased use of birth control was seen by some as a form of social decay.[166] A decrease of fertility was seen as a negative. Throughout the Progressive Era (1890–1920), there was an increase of voluntary associations aiding the contraceptive movement.[166] These organizations failed to enlist more than 100,000 women because the use of birth control was often compared to eugenics;[166] however, there were women seeking a community with like-minded women. The ideology that surrounded birth control started to gain traction during the Progressive Era due to voluntary associations establishing community. Birth control was unlike the Victorian Era because women wanted to manage their sexuality. The use of birth control was another form of self-interest women clung to. This was seen as women began to gravitate towards strong figures, like the Gibson Girl.[167]\n\nThe first permanent birth-control clinic was established in Britain in 1921 by Marie Stopes working with the Malthusian League.[168] The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors,[169] offered women's birth-control advice and taught them the use of a cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.[170] In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics; this led to the opening of a second clinic in Greengate, Salford in 1926.[171] Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, played a major role in breaking down taboos about sex. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere – three months later, the Ministry of Health, in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres.[172]\n\nThe National Birth Control Association was founded in Britain in 1931, and became the Family Planning Association eight years later. The Association amalgamated several British birth control-focused groups into 'a central organisation' for administering and overseeing birth control in Britain. The group incorporated the Birth Control Investigation Committee, a collective of physicians and scientists that was founded to investigate scientific and medical aspects of contraception with 'neutrality and impartiality'.[173] Subsequently, the Association effected a series of 'pure' and 'applied' product and safety standards that manufacturers must meet to ensure their contraceptives could be prescribed as part of the Association's standard two-part-technique combining 'a rubber appliance to protect the mouth of the womb' with a 'chemical preparation capable of destroying... sperm'.[174] Between 1931 and 1959, the Association founded and funded a series of tests to assess chemical efficacy and safety and rubber quality.[175] These tests became the basis for the Association's Approved List of contraceptives, which was launched in 1937, and went on to become an annual publication that the expanding network of FPA clinics relied upon as a means to 'establish facts [about contraceptives] and to publish these facts as a basis on which a sound public and scientific opinion can be built'.[176]\n\nIn 1936, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries that medically prescribing contraception to save a person's life or well-being was not illegal under the Comstock Laws. Following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control.[citation needed] A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent of the adult population supported the use of contraception.[citation needed] By 1938, 374 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal.[177] First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning.[178] The restrictions on birth control in the Comstock laws were effectively rendered null and void by Supreme Court decisions Griswold v. Connecticut (1965)[179] and Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972).[180] In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families.[181] The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010, under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods. These include barrier methods, hormonal methods, implanted devices, emergency contraceptives, and sterilization procedures.[182]\n\nModern methods [ edit ]\n\nIn 1909, Richard Richter developed the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg in the late 1920s.[183] In 1951, an Austrian-born American chemist, named Carl Djerassi at Syntex in Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana).[184] Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute it to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock with help from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America developed the first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid.[170][185] Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.[186]\n\nSociety and culture [ edit ]\n\nLegal positions [ edit ]\n\nHuman rights agreements require most governments to provide family planning and contraceptive information and services. These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that a wide variety of safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented. If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.[187]\n\nIn the United States, the 1965 Supreme Court decision Griswold v. Connecticut overturned a state law prohibiting dissemination of contraception information based on a constitutional right to privacy for marital relationships. In 1972, Eisenstadt v. Baird extended this right to privacy to single people.[188]\n\nIn 2010, the United Nations launched the Every Woman Every Child movement to assess the progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs. The initiative has set a goal of increasing the number of users of modern birth control by 120 million women in the world's 69 poorest countries by 2020. Additionally, they aim to eradicate discrimination against girls and young women who seek contraceptives.[189] The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended in 2014 that oral birth control pills should be over the counter medications.[190]\n\nSince at least the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal commentators have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, as part of an ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873 and 2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.[191]\n\nReligious views [ edit ]\n\nReligions vary widely in their views of the ethics of birth control.[192] The Roman Catholic Church re-affirmed its teachings in 1968 that only natural family planning is permissible,[193] although large numbers of Catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods of birth control.[194][195][196] The Greek Orthodox Church admits a possible exception to its traditional teaching forbidding the use of artificial contraception, if used within marriage for certain purposes, including the spacing of births.[197] Among Protestants, there is a wide range of views from supporting none, such as in the Quiverfull movement, to allowing all methods of birth control.[198] Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect, which prohibits all methods of birth control, to the more relaxed Reform sect, which allows most.[199] Hindus may use both natural and modern contraceptives.[200] A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not.[201] In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.[202]\n\nWorld Contraception Day [ edit ]\n\nSeptember 26 is World Contraception Day, devoted to raising awareness and improving education about sexual and reproductive health, with a vision of a world where every pregnancy is wanted.[203] It is supported by a group of governments and international NGOs, including the Office of Population Affairs, the Asian Pacific Council on Contraception, Centro Latinamericano Salud y Mujer, the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health, the German Foundation for World Population, the International Federation of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Marie Stopes International, Population Services International, the Population Council, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Women Deliver.[203]\n\nMisconceptions [ edit ]\n\nThere are a number of common misconceptions regarding sex and pregnancy.[204] Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control.[205] Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended.[206] Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse[207] and in any sexual position.[208] It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.[209] Contraceptive use, regardless of its duration and type, does not have a negative effect on the ability of women to conceive following termination of use and does not significantly delay fertility. Women who use oral contraceptives for a longer duration may have a slightly lower rate of pregnancy than do women using oral contraceptives for a shorter period of time, possibly due to fertility decreasing with age.[210]\n\nAccessibility [ edit ]\n\nAccess to birth control may be affected by finances and the laws within a region or country.[211] In the United States African American, Hispanic, and young women are disproportionately affected by limited access to birth control, as a result of financial disparity.[212][213] For example, Hispanic and African American women often lack insurance coverage and are more often poor.[214] New immigrants in the United States are not offered preventive care such as birth control.[215]\n\nIn the United Kingdom contraception can be obtained free of charge via contraception clinics, sexual health or GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinics, via some GP surgeries, some young people's services and pharmacies.[216][217]\n\nIn September 2021, France announced that women aged under 25 in France will be offered free contraception from 2022. It was elaborated that they \"would not be charged for medical appointments, tests, or other medical procedures related to birth control\" and that this would \"cover hormonal contraception, biological tests that go with it, the prescription of contraception and all care related to this contraception\".[218]\n\nFrom August 2022 onwards contraception for women aged between 17 and 25 years will be free in the Republic of Ireland.[219][220]\n\nAdvocacy [ edit ]\n\nFree the Pill, a collaboration between Advocates for Youth and Ibis Reproductive Health are working to bring birth control over-the-counter, covered by insurance with no age-restriction throughout the United States.[221][222][223]\n\nApproval [ edit ]\n\nOn July 13, 2023 the first US daily oral nonprescription over-the-counter birth control pill was approved for manufacturer by the FDA. The pill, Opill is expected to be more effective in preventing unintended pregnancies than condoms are. Opill is expected to be available in 2024 but the price has yet to be set. Perrigo, a pharmaceutical company based in Dublin is the manufacturer. [224]\n\nResearch directions [ edit ]\n\nFemales [ edit ]\n\nImprovements of existing birth control methods are needed, as around half of those who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time.[29] A number of alterations of existing contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone.[225] This vaginal ring appears to be effective for three or four months and is currently available in some areas of the world.[225] For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.[226]\n\nA number of methods to perform sterilization via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While the procedure is inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects.[227] Another substance, polidocanol, which functions in the same manner is being looked at.[225] A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.[227] In 2016, a black boxed warning regarding potentially serious side effects was added,[228][229] and in 2018, the device was discontinued.[230]\n\nMales [ edit ]\n\nCurrent common methods of male birth control include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal.[231][232]\n\nA number of novel contraceptive methods based on hormonal and non-hormonal mechanisms of action are in various stages of research and development, up to and including clinical trials.[233][234][235][236][237][238] Methods in development include long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), daily transdermal gels and oral pills, injectables, implants, wearables, and oral on-demand contraceptives.[239][240][241]\n\nMen consistently report high levels of interest in novel forms of male contraception.[242][243][244] Development of novel male contraceptive methods has been ongoing for many decades, but progress been stymied by a lack of industry involvement. Most funding for male contraceptive research is derived from government or philanthropic sources.[245][246][247][248]\n\nAnimals [ edit ]\n\nNeutering or spaying, which involves removing some of the reproductive organs, is often carried out as a method of birth control in household pets. Many animal shelters require these procedures as part of adoption agreements.[249] In large animals the surgery is known as castration.[250]\n\nBirth control is also being considered as an alternative to hunting as a means of controlling overpopulation in wild animals.[251] Contraceptive vaccines have been found to be effective in a number of different animal populations.[252][253] Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an olor, to male goats to prevent them from impregnating female goats.[254]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]"], "label": "S", "category": "ExpertQA", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": " According to my web search, an autoclave is a device that uses steam to sterilize equipment and other objects.", "reference_documents": ["An autoclave is a machine that provides a physical method of sterilization by killing bacteria, viruses, and even spores present in the material put inside of the vessel using steam under pressure.\n\nAutoclave sterilizes the materials by heating them up to a particular temperature for a specific period of time. The autoclave is also called a steam sterilizer that is commonly used in healthcare facilities and industries for various purposes. The autoclave is considered a more effective method of sterilization as it is based on moist heat sterilization.\n\nImage Source: Wikipedia, https://ilabot.blogspot.com/, and Wikipedia.\n\nAutoclave Parts/ Components\n\nThe simplest form of the autoclave is the pressure cooker type or laboratory bench autoclaves. The following is the detailed description of different components/ parts of an autoclave:\n\nFigure: Autoclave Parts or Components. Image Source: pharmawiki.\n\na. Pressure Chamber\n\nThe pressure chamber is the main component of a steam autoclave consisting of an inner chamber and an outer jacket.\n\nThe inner chamber is made up of stainless steel or gunmetal, which is present inside the out chamber made up of an iron case.\n\nThe autoclaves used in healthcare laboratories have an outer jacket that is filled with steam to reduce the time taken to reach the sterilization temperature.\n\nThe inner chamber is the case where the materials to be sterilized are put.\n\nThe size of the pressure chamber ranges from 100 L to 3000 L.\n\nb. Lid/ Door\n\nThe next important component of an autoclave is the lid or door of the autoclave.\n\nThe purpose of the lid is to seal off the outside atmosphere and create a sterilized condition on ht inside of the autoclave.\n\nThe lid is made airtight via the screw clamps and asbestos washer.\n\nThe lid consists of various other components like:\n\nPressure gauge\n\nA pressure gauge is present on the lid of the autoclave to indicate the pressure created in the autoclave during sterilization.\n\nThe pressure gauge is essential as it assures the safety of the autoclave and the working condition of the operation.\n\nPressure releasing unit/ Whistle\n\nA whistle is present on the lid of the autoclave is the same as that of the pressure cooker.\n\nThe whistle controls the pressure inside the chamber by releasing a certain amount of vapor by lifting itself.\n\nSafety valve\n\nA safety valve is present on the lid of the autoclave, which is crucial in cases where the autoclave fails to perform its action or the pressure inside increases uncontrollably.\n\nThe valve has a thin layer of rubber that bursts itself to release the pressure and to avoid the danger of explosion.\n\nc. Steam generator/ Electrical heater\n\nAn electrical steam generator or boiler is present underneath the chamber that uses an electric heating system to heat the water and generate steam in the inner and the outer chamber.\n\nThe level of water present in the inner chamber is vital as if the water is not sufficient; there are chances of the burning of the heating system.\n\nSimilarly, if the water is more than necessary, it might interfere with the trays and other components present inside the chamber.\n\nd. Vacuum generator (if applicable)\n\nIn some types of autoclaves, a separate vacuum generator is present which pulls out the air from the inside of the chamber to create a vacuum inside the chamber.\n\nThe presence of some air pockets inside the chamber might support the growth of different microorganisms. This is why the vacuum chamber is an important component of an autoclave.\n\ne. Wastewater cooler\n\nMany autoclaves are provided with a system to cool the effluent before it enters the draining pipes.\n\nThis system prevents any damage to the drainage pipe due to the boiling water being sent out of the autoclave.\n\nAutoclave Principle/ Working\n\nFigure: Autoclave Principle or Working.\n\nThe autoclave works on the principle of moist heat sterilization where steam under pressure is used to sterilize the material present inside the chamber.\n\nThe high pressure increases the boiling point of water and thus helps achieve a higher temperature for sterilization.\n\nWater usually boils at 100°C under normal atmospheric pressure (760 mm of Hg); however, the boiling point of water increases if the pressure is to be increased.\n\nSimilarly, the high pressure also facilitates the rapid penetration of heat into deeper parts of the material, and moisture present in the steam causes the coagulation of proteins causing an irreversible loss of function and activity of microbes.\n\nThis principle is employed in an autoclave where the water boils at 121°C at the pressure of 15 psi or 775 mm of Hg.\n\nWhen this steam comes in contact with the surface, it kills the microbes by giving off latent heat.\n\nThe condensed liquid ensures the moist killing of the microbes.\n\nOnce the sterilization phase is completed (which depends on the level of contamination of material inside), the pressure is released from the inside of the chamber through the whistle.\n\nThe pressure inside the chamber is then restored back to the ambient pressure while the components inside remain hot for some time.\n\nVideo: Principle and Working of Autoclave (Pharmaguideline)\n\nProcedure for running an autoclave\n\nIn general, an autoclave is run at a temperature of 121° C for at least 30 minutes by using saturated steam under at least 15 psi of pressure. The following are the steps to be followed while running an autoclave:\n\nBefore beginning to use the autoclave, it should be checked for any items left from the previous cycle. A sufficient amount of water is then put inside the chamber. Now, the materials to be sterilized are placed inside the chamber. The lid is then closed, and the screws are tightened to ensure an airtight condition, and the electric heater is switched on. The safety valves are adjusted to maintain the required pressure in the chamber. Once the water inside the chamber boils, the air-water mixture is allowed to escape through the discharge tube to let all the air inside to be displaced. The complete displacement can be ensured once the water bubbles cease to come out from the pipe. The drainage pipe is then closed, and the steam inside is allowed to reach the desired levels (15 lbs in most cases). Once the pressure is reached, the whistle blows to remove excess pressure from the chamber. After the whistle, the autoclave is run for a holding period, which is 15 minutes in most cases. Now, the electric heater is switched off, and the autoclave is allowed to cool until the pressure gauge indicates the pressure inside has lowered down to that of the atmospheric pressure. The discharge pipe is then opened to allow the entry of air from the outside into the autoclave. Finally, the lid is opened, and the sterilized materials are taken out of the chamber.\n\nVideo: How to use an autoclave (BioNetwork)\n\nTypes of Autoclave\n\nThere are different types of autoclaves present in the market, some of which are:\n\nPressure cooker type/ Laboratory bench autoclaves (N-type)\n\nThese, as domestic pressure cookers, are still in use in many parts of the world.\n\nThe more modern type has a metal chamber with a secure metal lid that can be fastened and sealed with a rubber gasket.\n\nIt has an air and steam discharge tap, pressure gauge, and safety valve. There is an electric immersion heater at the bottom of the chamber.\n\nGravity displacement type autoclave\n\nThis is the common type of autoclave used in laboratories.\n\nIn this type of autoclave, the steam is created inside the chamber via the heating unit, which then moves around the chamber for sterilization.\n\nThis type of autoclave is comparatively cheaper than other types.\n\nPositive pressure displacement type (B-type)\n\nIn this type of autoclave, the steam is generated in a separate steam generator which is then passed into the autoclave.\n\nThis autoclave is faster as the steam can be generated within seconds.\n\nThis type of autoclave is an improvement over the gravity displacement type.\n\nNegative pressure displacement type (S-type)\n\nThis is another type of autoclave that contains both the steam generator as well as a vacuum generator.\n\nHere, the vacuum generator pulls out all the air from inside the autoclave while the steam generator creates steam.\n\nThe steam is then passed into the autoclave.\n\nThis is the most recommended type of autoclave as it is very accurate and achieves a high sterility assurance level.\n\nThis is also the most expensive type of autoclave.\n\nFigure: Types of Autoclaves. Image Source: Microbe Online.\n\nUses of Autoclave\n\nAutoclaves are important devices to ensure the sterilization of materials containing water as they cannot be sterilized by dry heat sterilization. Besides, autoclaves are used for various other purposes.\n\nThey are used to decontaminate specific biological waste and sterilize media, instruments, and labware. Regulated medical waste that might contain bacteria, viruses, and other biological materials is recommended to be inactivated by autoclaving before disposal. In medical labs, autoclaves are used to sterilize medical equipment, glassware, surgical equipment, and medical wastes. Similarly, autoclaves are used for the sterilization of culture media, autoclavable containers, plastic tubes, and pipette tips.\n\nSubscribe us to receive latest notes. Email Address*\n\nPrecautions\n\nAlthough autoclaves are pretty simple to use, there are certain rules of precautions to be followed while operating an autoclave. Some of the important precautions to be followed while running an autoclave are:\n\nAutoclaves should not be used to sterilize water-proof or water-resistant substances like oil or powders. The autoclave should not be overcrowded, and the materials should be loaded in a way that ensures sufficient penetration of articles by the steam. TheThe items to be autoclaved should always be placed in a secondary container. Only autoclavable bags are to be used to autoclave packaged waste. To ensure sufficient penetration, articles should be wrapped in something that allows penetration by steam, and materials like aluminum foils should not be used. The items placed inside the chamber should not touch the sides or top of the chamber. The wastes and clean items should be autoclaved separately. Attempts to open the lid when the autoclave is working should never be made. Liquid components should never be autoclaved in sealed containers. The liquid inside the containers should only be filled 2/3rd of the total volume to prevent the spilling of the liquid. Plastic or polyethylene trays or containers should not be used as they might melt and damage the autoclave. Besides, never autoclave flammable, reactive, corrosive, toxic, or radioactive materials, household bleach, or paraffin-embedded tissue. The paper should not be placed directly inside an autoclave as it is a combustible substance. It should be autoclaved in a waste bag on a bio bag setting to prevent fire.\n\nReferences"], "label": "S", "category": "ExpertQA", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "DNA fingerprinting**: This method uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify specific segments of DNA and compare their patterns. - **", "reference_documents": ["One application of DNA hybridization is called DNA colony hybridization. To detect particular genes that might be present in the cells of a bacterial colony, the DNA is tested by hybridization to a gene probe . An array of colonies growing on an agar service is lysed so the DNA is gently released and then it is immobilized on a membrane. The gene probe is used to test the DNA on the membrane to determine if it contains similar sequences by using DNA hybridization. If the sequences hybridize, the \"reporter\" groups on the probe will be associated with the DNA on the membrane (target DNA).\n\nFor example, cells of pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica were seeded into foods that were then spread-plated and incubated until colonies were formed. Colony hybridization was carried out to determine the efficiency of detection and the effect of various foods. Detection levels were between 50 and 100 % of the cells added and the different types of food had little effect on the efficiency of detection.\n\nThe Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):\n\nPCR is a procedure for selectively replicating a specific segment of DNA. It consists of adding two primers (single stranded DNA, oligonucleotides, about 20 basepairs in length) which will serve as sites for the initiation of DNA synthesis. The basic steps are three temperature changes to allow primers to bind to the single stranded DNA to be copied (the template). Each cycle of temperature changes allows the DNA strands (including the newly made ones) to serve as templates so the amount of DNA doubles every cycle. At the end of the second cycle the newly made strands are bounded by the primers. These fixed length molecules increase exponentially for 30 or 40 cycles (a 230 to 240-fold increase) and because they are the same length will appear as a band when examined by agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nPCR Example:\n\nThe schematic map of the toxin genes sltI and sltII of Escherichia coli O157:H7 shows the locations of the primers and the predicted size of the amplified products. In this example, two sets of primers are used to amplify two different regions (multiplex PCR). The predicted size of each region is different so that the PCR products can be separated by gel electrophoresis as shown. During an outbreak caused by E. coli O157:H7, isolates from patients can be characterized and compared with those recovered from a food suspected to be contaminated as part of the epidemiological investigation. The isolates for hamburger are the same as some of the patient isolates suggestion but not proving a link between the disease and the food.\n\nGenetic Subtyping and Molecular Epidemiology:\n\nPCR is only of limited use for subtyping because only a few bands (generally 1 or 2) are generated. Other subtyping techniques such as ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis can produce many bands from each isolate so that many comparisons can be made.\n\nRibotyping:\n\nAll organisms carry genes for encoding ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a principle component of the ribosome. The ribosome is the site of cellular protein synthesis. Because all organisms are evolutionarily related, they share some similarity in their sequence of these genes. In bacteria, there are usually several copies of these genes that may be located at different sites in the bacterial chromosome. This can be revealed by isolating chromosomal DNA, digesting it with a restriction endonuclease, separating the fragments by gel electrophoresis and then transferring the pattern of fragments to a solid support (often called a Southern blot). Next, hybridization using labeled rRNA, usually from Escherichia coli, is carried out. Only fragments containing sequences complementary to rRNA will be seen. This pattern of chromosomal fragments is called a ribotype and is a measure of the genetic similarity between two organisms. . Ribotypes of Listeria monocytogenes have been used to differentiate strains from each another. Note that the pattern obtained from the isolate from Patient C does not match the strain isolated from the mussels suggesting that the illness probably was caused by another source.\n\nPulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE):\n\nOrdinary gel electrophoresis techniques are not capable of separating molecules larger than 50-100 kilobase pairs, but by precisely varying the direction and duration of the electric current, small differences between large molecules can be resolved. Newly developed, very gentle DNA isolation techniques to obtain intact bacterial chromosomes are essential. The similarity of the restriction endonuclease fragment patterns of chromosomal DNA is a measure of the genetic similarity between two organisms. Strains of E. coli from an outbreak have been characterized by using this technique. Notice the differences between strains that harbor sltII only and those that have both the sltI and sltII genes.\n\nPCR-RFLP:\n\nWhen PCR is used to amplify closely related organisms the PCR products may be identical in size. However, there may be some differences in nucleotide sequence which can be exploited by cleaving (digesting) the PCR product with a restriction endonuclease. When restriction enzyme digests of amplified Cyclospora and Eimeria DNA are separated by electrophoresis, different patterns are observed.\n\nAnalysis of Similarities:\n\nAs an example, let's consider the 16S rRNA gene sequences of some strains of bacteria. These can be aligned by computer and displayed so that only the sequence differences are shown, that is, the locations where each sequence matches the consensus sequence has been left blank. The sequences can be compared with one another and a number assigned to reflect the similarity. Where two sequences are identical, the similarity is equal to 1.0; If the sequences are only half the same, the similarity is equal to 0.50. When all sequences are compared to every other sequence, a similarity matrix can be constructed. The significance of this data is hard to grasp in this format but a two-dimensional graphical representation called a dendrogram allows us to visualize similar groups as clusters. Finally, the relationships between the groups can be illustrated in three dimensions using principal component analysis. Thus, rather complex mathematical relationships of similarity data can be easily visualized graphically.\n\nDNA fingerprinting methods for bacterial identification centre primarily on the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Repetitive element-PCR, for example, targets specific DNA segments that are repeated at random in the bacterial genome. The identification of repetitive elements is powerful, capable of resolving bacteria at intraspecies levels. DNA sequencing methods, including whole genome sequencing and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), likewise have proved useful in the identification of bacteria. MLSA, which entails DNA sequencing of subsets of so-called housekeeping (or conserved) genes, has been shown to provide resolution down to intraspecies levels.\n\nDNA -based approaches used in the identification and classification of species of bacteria include DNA-DNA hybridization, DNA fingerprinting , and DNA sequencing . DNA-DNA hybridization, initially developed in the 1980s, is used to determine the similarity of DNA sequences from different organisms. The degree of similarity is reflected in the degree to which a strand of DNA from the organism of interest passively hybridizes with (attaches to) a single strand of DNA from a known organism. The less stable the hybridization is, the more quickly the DNA strands will dissociate when heated; hence, low DNA melting temperatures typically suggest low degrees of sequence similarity. DNA-DNA hybridization is most valuable for determining genetic relatedness at the genus and species levels.\n\n16S rRNA analysis\n\nEvolutionary relatedness can also be assessed through the sequencing of 16S rRNA, the gene that encodes the RNA component of the smaller subunit of the bacterial ribosome (16S refers to the rate of sedimentation, in Svedberg units, of the RNA molecule in a centrifugal field). The 16S rRNA gene is present in all bacteria, and a related form occurs in all cells. The 16S rRNA gene of E. coli is 1,542 nucleotides long, and some of its regions are double-stranded, while other regions are single-stranded. Single-stranded regions often form loops, because there is a lack of complementary bases on the opposing strand. Since 16S rRNA makes very specific contacts with many different ribosomal proteins and with other parts of itself, the pace at which spontaneous random mutation can change the sequence of the bases in the rRNA is slow. Any change in sequence at one site must be compensated for by another change elsewhere within the rRNA or in a ribosomal protein, lest the ribosome fail to assemble properly or to function in protein synthesis and the cell die.\n\nAnalysis of the 16S rRNA sequences from many organisms has revealed that some portions of the molecule undergo rapid genetic changes, thereby distinguishing between different species within the same genus. Other positions change very slowly, allowing much broader taxonomic levels to be distinguished. The comparison of 16S rRNA sequences between organisms is quantitative and is based on a defined set of assumptions. The assumption that the rate at which base changes occur and are established within a species is constant is unlikely to be true. Changes in Earth’s environment are expected to alter the ecological niches or selective pressures that affect the rate of mutation and the rate at which various species are able to evolve.\n\nThe radical differences between Archaea and Bacteria, which are evident in the composition of their lipids and cell walls and in the utilization of different metabolic pathways, enzymes, and enzyme cofactors, are also reflected in the rRNA sequences. The rRNAs of Bacteria and Archaea are as different from each other as they are from eukaryotic rRNA. That suggests that the bacterial and archaeal lines diverged from a common precursor somewhat before eukaryotic cells developed. That proposal also implies that the eukaryotic line is quite ancient and probably did not arise from any currently known bacteria. It had been previously believed that eukaryotic cells arose when some bacterial cells engulfed another type of bacterium. Those bacteria might have formed a symbiotic relationship in which the engulfed cell continued to survive but gradually lost its independence and took on the properties of an organelle. Although the original eukaryotic cell may or may not be derived from bacteria, it remains likely, if not certain, that eukaryotic organelles (e.g., mitochondria and chloroplasts) are descendants of bacteria that were acquired by eukaryotic cells in an example of symbiotic parasitism.\n\nEarly hypotheses about the origins of life suggested that the first cells obtained their energy from the breakdown of nutrients in a rich organic liquid environment proposed to have formed in the early oceans by the action of light and intense solar radiation on the early, anaerobic atmosphere. The process of photosynthesis might have evolved much later in response to the gradual depletion of those rich nutrient sources. On the other hand, rRNA sequence analysis places photosynthetic capability in almost all of the major bacterial divisions and shows that photosynthetic genera are closely related to nonphotosynthetic genera. Since photosynthesis is such a highly conserved, mechanistically complex process, it is unlikely that the ability to carry out photosynthesis could have evolved at different times in so many different organisms. Even more widely distributed among prokaryotes is lithotrophy (from the Greek word lithos, meaning “stone”), the ability to obtain energy by the transfer of electrons from hydrogen gas to inorganic acceptors. It has been proposed that the earliest forms of life on Earth used lithotrophic metabolism and that photosynthesis was a later addition to the early bacterial progenitors. The nonlithotrophic and nonphotosynthetic forms found today arose from the earliest forms of Bacteria, although they have lost their capacities for lithotrophy and photosynthesis.\n\nThe proposal that lithotrophy was widely distributed among bacterial organisms before photosynthesis developed suggests that the Archaea came from a different line of descent from that of Bacteria. The only photosynthetic archaeon, Halobacterium, has a completely different type of photosynthesis that does not use chlorophyll in large protein complexes to activate an electron, as in plants and bacteria. Rather, it uses a single protein, bacteriorhodopsin, in which light energy is absorbed by retinal, a form of vitamin A, to activate a proton (hydrogen ion).\n\nThe analysis of rRNA sequences from bacteria that are closely related to one another has revealed several surprising relationships between those organisms. For example, Mycoplasma, which appear to be different from other bacteria—in that they are very small, lack a cell wall, have a very small genome, and have sterols in their cell membranes—actually are related to some gram-positive clostridia on the basis of their nucleic acid sequences. That circumstance underscores the hazard of relying on phenotypic traits (observable characteristics such as the absence of a cell wall) for the assignment of evolutionary or genetic relationships. In fact, there are many groupings of bacteria that are not supported by RNA sequence analysis.\n\nA limitation of 16S rRNA sequence analysis, however, is its poor resolution below the genus level. Populations of organisms in a given genus that reside within the same habitats can have unique 16S rRNA genotypes. However, whether those unique genotypes are indicative of distinct species typically cannot be determined from rRNA information alone."], "label": "S", "category": "ExpertQA", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Bipolar disorder is a primary disorder of **mood**, while borderline personality disorder is a primary disorder of **personality** involving longstanding interpersonal dysfunction.", "reference_documents": ["The essential problem in assessing bipolar disorder with other mental disorders is the lack of a clear roadmap for an accurate differential diagnosis. As I have written before, nearly two-thirds of people with bipolar have been misdiagnosed at least one time in their lives and will have consulted an average of nearly four professionals before receiving the proper bipolar diagnosis. What is perhaps most disturbing is the length of time it takes for an individual to receive a bipolar diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The average time from when a person experiences the first bipolar mood episode to receiving treatment specifically for bipolar disorder is about 10 years. This gap in treatment is the result of a profound misunderstanding of what bipolar is, how it presents itself in episodes that can come and go, and a general reticence to discuss having a chronic mental illness, especially when symptoms are present in a young person.\n\nWhile most people with bipolar disorder are diagnosed with non-bipolar major depression, many are inaccurately diagnosed with a personality disorder. It is true that someone with bipolar disorder can also have a co-occurring personality disorder, but these classifications can often be confused for each other and create treatment complications as a result.\n\nSome personality disorders can mimic the behavioral signs within bipolar mood swings, especially in the manic mood zones. Borderline, narcissistic, and antisocial personality disorders can have some of the closest similarities to the more salient aspects of bipolar disorder. In this post, I’ll focus specifically on borderline personality disorder and how to better differentiate it from bipolar disorder.\n\nBorderline individuals typically display stark emotional changes, turbulent relationship patterns, and irresponsible or risky personal behaviors. A key component of borderline personality is called idealization/devaluation, or splitting. This means a borderline person can idealize another person in a relationship (including a therapist during the course of therapy) as “all good” or a “perfect soul mate.” Later, and usually without apparent provocation, that same amazing person will be devalued by the person with the borderline condition as “all bad” or “useless.” This drastic shift in cognition, emotion, and behavior towards others is a hallmark of borderline personality.\n\nBut the harsh instabilities in mood, relationships, and social behavior can appear manic, and thus easily be confused with bipolar disorder. Any differentiation between the two disorders is complicated by the fact that those with borderline personality disorder can suffer severe depression with suicidal thoughts and actions in the same way people with bipolar can. But while the instability of mood is a persistent problem with borderline personality, in bipolar, mood changes come and go with periods of baseline stability. People with borderline personality also intensely fear abandonment in relationships, which certainly can happen in people with bipolar, but is not itself a feature of bipolar disorder.\n\nThe first major distinction between these diagnoses is that bipolar is a primary disorder of mood and borderline is a primary disorder of personality involving longstanding interpersonal dysfunction. As a result, bipolar disorder manifests in mood episodes that can change rapidly or in long stretches, with periods of ostensible balance in between, referred to as the baseline mood zone. Therefore, symptoms of bipolar disorder are regarded as episodic. Conversely, borderline personality is considered pervasive, where symptoms and functional consequences of the disorder are continual across mood states. This may seem deceiving to some who have seen people with borderline appear to be happy, mellow, or just having a “good day,” as a bipolar-type baseline mood zone. But while immediate behavioral signs may point to a stable mood position, the pervasiveness of borderline personality often reflects an ongoing entangled and chaotic mess of interpersonal relationships and self-image no matter what mood state is present.\n\nSo, while mood instability and interpersonal conflicts can be salient in both bipolar and borderline, the differences begin in the origins of symptoms and their behavioral consequences. One way to approach this is to ask the question, “What primary aspect of the particular disorder is driving the secondary product?” Bipolar disorder is a disorder of mood, which originates genetically and affects the brain’s ability to regulate emotion. In effect, the bipolar mood swings drive consequences in the person with the disorder, including increased impulsivity and interpersonal disruptions.\n\nMood lability in borderline personality disorder may be more reactive and subsequent to the internal and interpersonal turmoil driven by the profound underlying fear of abandonment, along with intense feelings of emptiness and alienation. While these factors don’t entirely preclude borderline as having some kind of genetic association, psychosocial and psycho-developmental factors appear to dominate the borderline etiology. In fact, the fear of abandonment so permeates borderline behavior that it can essentially govern every shift in mood and action, as we can see in the ego defense of splitting, which reduces others to objects easily divided into idealized and devalued parts. The essential goal of splitting is to both fill the sense of emptiness through idealizing and over-identifying with the other (or object), while controlling the anxiety of the perceived inevitable abandonment by means of devaluing the other, oftentimes with considerable hostility.\n\nStress and anxiety, including the fear of abandonment, can certainly influence a mood episode in bipolar disorder. However, this would be more of a catalyst to the foundational and pre-disposed nature of neurological changes that govern mood episodes and would be only one of potentially several catalysts, including those of both endogenous and exogenous origins. Anxiety in someone with borderline personality, and the responses to it including self-harm, suicidal gestures, erratic spending, hypersexuality, or outbursts of rage stem from underlying fear in the context of interpersonal and ego dysfunction. And as splitting is a primary ego defense in borderline personality, denial appears to be a far more predominant defense in bipolar disorder. In fact, if splitting is persistent in someone with a clear diagnosis of bipolar disorder, there is a reasonable likelihood that borderline personality coexists with the overall bipolar condition.\n\nAnother factor that can be useful in separating these diagnoses involves onset. The average age of bipolar onset is 18 years of age, which means that children can show signs of the disorder early in life, and perhaps may have expressed prodromal symptoms prior to a complete constellation of symptoms that meet DSM-5 criteria in adult life. There is no average age of borderline onset per se; in fact, the longstanding nature of this disorder of character means that a diagnosis requires active and persistent symptoms well into adult life. Certainly, some adolescents can demonstrate borderline traits that may eventually coalesce into a borderline diagnosis, but this is not in itself a reliable predictor for the diagnosis in later life. Mood instability in bipolar disorder, however, can often be traced to childhood, especially if noticeably triggered by adolescent hormonal changes and does not stabilize into early adulthood.\n\nThe overlap of bipolar and borderline symptoms may seem to suggest that treatment approaches would be similar, but this is not typically the case. While I believe that both disorders need protracted psychotherapy services, especially in the individual modality, there are some important differences to consider. In bipolar, therapy is focused in the pre-stabilization phase on the immediate crisis created or exacerbated by bipolar mood swings, working through denial towards acceptance of the bipolar reality, and any intrapsychic conflicts related to the initiation of bipolar medication trials towards mood stabilization. In borderline personality, establishing trust in the therapeutic alliance is often the top priority, especially given the individual’s pattern of interpersonal instability. Not that people with bipolar don’t need a solid experience of trust in therapy to move forward; but with borderline patients, establishing and maintaining trust and constancy in a therapeutic alliance is paramount to any reasonable prognosis in improving self-image, frustration tolerance, and interpersonal functioning. And even then, therapy may take many months or years of consistent therapy before such improvements are sustainable.\n\nAs someone with bipolar disorder progresses through stabilization towards post-stabilization, therapy can focus increasingly on the prior functional consequences of the disorder (e.g., financial distress, extramarital affairs, drug abuse, etc). This progression can make therapy more broadly effective with respect to related life issues and allow for other treatment modalities, such as couples therapy, to be more adaptable to particular life conflicts. In therapy for borderline personality, the increased sense of reliance on the therapist as a trusted figure often reignites profound fears of abandonment, which promote ego defenses, paranoid projections, and the unconscious reenactment of psychological trauma, all of which can reoccur throughout treatment. A therapist treating a patient with borderline personality should anticipate and prepare for these features as they become manifest in the transference phenomenon.\n\nAnother reason to differentiate bipolar and borderline involves medication issues. Mood stabilizing medications, such as lamotrigine, are generally effective for bipolar disorder but have not shown to be consistently effective in borderline personality disorder. It’s understandable, though, why a treating physician might prescribe a mood stabilizer over an antidepressant, especially if he or she is concerned about an underlying bipolar disorder in someone with a primary presentation of borderline personality. That’s because antidepressants, such as SSRIs and SNRIs, can act as catalysts for mania in people with bipolar disorder, especially if no mood stabilizer is present in the regimen.\n\nDoctors may also consider atypical antipsychotic medication if there is no clear differentiation of borderline and bipolar symptoms, especially if evidence of psychosis is suspected. While it may be true that the pharmacological treatment of borderline personality is generally more complicated than that of bipolar disorder, a clearer diagnostic picture can assist physicians in opening a wider array of treatment options for these disorders, whether they may be distinct or co-occurring."], "label": "S", "category": "ExpertQA", "additional_info": ""}

The sweating is localized to specific parts of the body in focal hyperhidrosis, while in general hyperhidrosis the sweating may be in several areas of the body, or all over the body. Complications of hyperhidrosis include skin problems and impacts on psychological well-being and quality of life.\n\nThis article will cover the symptoms of hypderhidrosis as well as rarer symptoms and complications.\n\nVerywell / Emily Roberts\n\nFrequent Symptoms\n\nPrimary Focal Hyperhidrosis Symptoms\n\nPrimary focal hyperhidrosis is a condition that usually begins in childhood. It is considered an idiopathic disease, meaning that the underlying cause is unknown, although it can be seen to run in families, so there may be a genetic component.\n\nIn primary focal hyperhidrosis sweating usually occurs in one or more “focal” areas of the body. Excessive sweating affects one or a combination of several areas of the body including:\n\nHands (palmer hyperhidrosis)\n\nFeet (solar hyperhidrosis)\n\nArmpits (axillary hyperhidrosis)\n\nFace (forehead) and head\n\nThe most common areas involved in focal hyperhidrosis include the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, and under the arms.\n\nProfuse sweating often:\n\nExceeds the normal level of body sweating\n\nOccurs regardless of activity level or body temperature\n\nInvolves the hands, feet, underarms and/or face\n\nInterferes with daily activities of life (for example, sweaty hands may interfere with proper grasping of items).\n\nCauses clothes to become stained (resulting in visible sweating that often results in embarrassment)\n\nCauses wet socks/shoes and an increase in foot odor\n\nResults in soft, cracked or scaly skin—from continuous moisture—on the affected areas.\n\nInvolves severe sweating episodes that occur at least once a week (during waking hours)\n\nOccurs on both sides of the body at once\n\nSecondary Generalized Hyperhidrosis Symptoms\n\nThose with secondary generalized hyperhidrosis are usually diagnosed later in life. Many times, the condition begins after a person is diagnosed with a different medical condition (such as a neurological or hormone-related disease), or may be caused by medications such as several anti-depression drugs. General hyperhidrosis involves sweating that is not necessarily linked with the body being overheated or with exercise, and it usually involves generalized sweating all over the body rather than just in specific areas. It’s also common for those with secondary generalized hyperhidrosis to sweat at night, whereas focal hyperhidrosis does not usually involve night sweats.\n\nMany of the symptoms of generalized hyperhidrosis are similar to that of primary focused hyperhidrosis. Sweating is much more excessive than normal bodily sweating. It occurs any time of day or night and it does not necessarily occur as a response to exercise, increased body temperature or nervousness/anxiety.\n\nProfuse sweating that may occur:\n\nIn one area of the body, or all over the body\n\nWhile asleep\n\nOn just one side of the body (such as on one side of the face)\n\nLater in life, many times after the diagnosis of a different condition or after starting on a new type of medication.\n\nRare Symptoms\n\nRare symptoms of hyperhidrosis may occur as a result of the diagnosis of an underlying condition, examples include:\n\nGreither’s Disease: A rare, inherited, skin disorder involving symptoms of:\n\nUnusual thickness and hardening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet\n\nExcessive sweating of the hands and feet\n\nFrey’s Syndrome: A rare neurological disorder that is often caused as a result of a complication from plastic surgery of the face or other types of facial or neck surgery. Symptoms include:\n\nSweating or flushing on one side of the cheek, temple, behind the ear or on the side of the face\n\nSweating often occurs when eating or thinking about eating\n\nSymptoms sometimes worsen when eating hot, spicy or highly acidic foods\n\nComplications\n\nThere are several complications that can occur as a result of the type of chronic, profuse sweating that people with hyperhidrosis can experience, these may include:\n\nSocial and emotional issues include embarrassment from body odor and visible sweating, social isolation, and more. Some individuals with hyperhidrosis describe their symptoms as being so severe that they hesitate to pursue a romantic partnership, avoid social activities, and experience severe anxiety due to the disorder. In fact, in a study, 35% of people with hyperhidrosis reported a decrease in leisure activity time due to excessive sweating and 41% reported that sweating interfered with their pursuit of hobbies, avoiding exercise, walking and even reading (for those with palmer hyperhidrosis).﻿﻿\n\nPsychological impact: As many as one-third of people with hyperhidrosis report their condition as being barely tolerable or intolerable and reported that the condition frequently interfering with activities of daily living.﻿﻿\n\nAdditional psychosocial symptoms of hyperhidrosis include:\n\nAvoiding social engagement (such as handshaking)\n\nDepression ﻿ ﻿\n\n﻿ Lack of confidence\n\nImpairment of work performance\n\nMissed social gatherings\n\nDifficulty with social and romantic relationships\n\nOther complications may include:\n\nSkin maceration (softening) can occur in the affected areas of the skin due to them being continually moist.\n\ncan occur in the affected areas of the skin due to them being continually moist. Tinea cruris (jock itch) is a fungal infection that results from the skin folds in the groin being wet continuously\n\nis a fungal infection that results from the skin folds in the groin being wet continuously Tenia pedis (athlete’s foot) is a fungal infection similar to tinea cruris.

This condition originates from a fungus that grows in a wet moist environment, located on the foot, usually in between the toes (instead of in the groin area). Skin infections can result from the combination of maceration, which causes skin breakdown, combined with bacteria and viruses that gravitate to moist, warm and dark areas of the body.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor\n\nHyperhidrosis can be the result of a condition that is much more serious, it’s important to seek medical advice when sweating is accompanied by symptoms such as:\n\nLightheadedness\n\nChest pain (or a feeling of pressure in the chest)\n\nSevere nausea\n\nWeight loss\n\nFever\n\nRapid heartbeat\n\nShortness of breath\n\nIt’s also important to see a doctor if your sweating:\n\nIs primarily experienced during sleeping hours (at night)\n\nInterferes with your normal daily activities\n\nCauses emotional withdrawal or depression\n\nSuddenly increases (sweating more than usual)\n\nPattern changes and you are experiencing sweating in a different focal area than it was originally experienced in (particularly after surgery), this condition is called compensatory sweating.\n\n\n\nA Word from Verywell\n\nOften, people with excessive sweating avoid seeking medical advice due to embarrassment. It’s important to understand that while experiencing symptoms of hyperhidrosis may be very unpleasant and frustrating, there is hope. There are medical interventions that can help to improve symptoms, online resources with tips on how to cope with the disease, as well as support groups with people who can offer help and support.

It is known as the Middle Assyrian Empire.\n\nDuring this period, the Assyrian Empire saw the reigns of many great kings, including Ashur-uballit I, Arik-den-ili, Tukulti-Ninurta I, and Tiglath-Pileser I.\n\nDuring this period, Assyria was able to overthrow the\n\nHurri-Mitanni Empire.\n\nHurri-Mitanni Empire.

This system was called the ilku-service.\n\nDue to the Bronze Age Collapse, the Dark Age for the entire Near East, North Africa, Asia Minor, Caucasus, the Mediterranean, and the Balkan regions happened.\n\nThe collapse did not affect the Assyrian Empire much, but the death of Ashur-bel-kala resulted in a comparative decline of the empire.\n\nDespite the visible weakness of the empire, as compared to its previous strength, the Assyrian Empire was still an empire with a stable monarchy, a powerful army, and secured borders. Due to these, the empire had leverage over its potential rivals, such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia, Lydia, and Media.\n\nNEO-ASSYRIAN EMPIRE\n\nThe ascension of Adad-nirari II marked the start of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\nDuring this period, Assyria was able to maintain a large and thriving rural population.\n\nThe major Assyrian cities during this time included Nineveh, Assur, Kalhu (Calah, Nimrud), Arbela (Erbil), Arrapha (Karka, Kirkuk), Dur-Sharrukin, Imgur-Enlil, Carchemish, Harran, Tushhan, Til-Barsip, Ekallatum, Kanesh, Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta, Urhai (Edessa), Guzana, Kahat, Amid (Diyarbakir), Mérida (Mardin, Tabitu, Nuhadra (Dohuk), Ivah, Sepharvaim, Rachae, Purushanda, Sabata, Birtha (Tikrit), Tell Shemshara, Dur-Katlimmu and Shekhna.\n\nWith the rise of Adad-nirari II, Assyria expanded its empire in all directions into Anatolia, Ancient Iran, Levant, and Babylonia.\n\nAshurbanipal II continued this expansion and later moved the capital from Ashur to Kalhu.\n\nAssyria experienced a period of instability and decline after the reign of Adad-nirari III until the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III.\n\nTiglath-Pileser III created the world’s first professional army, and he was able to conquer areas as far as the East Mediterranean.\n\nIn history, Assyria was able to conquer Babylonia, Chaldea, Elam, Media, Persia, Urartu (Armenia), Phoenicia, Aramea/Syria, Phrygia, the Neo-Hittite States, the Hurrian lands, Arabia, Gutium, Israel, Judah, Samarra, Moab, Edom, Corduene, Cilicia, Mannea, and Cyprus.\n\nDOWNFALL\n\nAfter the death of Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian Empire experienced its worst decline.\n\nThe empire experienced brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, Ashur-etil-ilani, Sin-shumu-lishir, and Sin-shar-ishkun.\n\nDue to the civil wars, several other groups took advantage of the situation and raided Assyrian areas.\n\nPOST-ASSYRIAN EMPIRE\n\nAfter its fall, Assyria came under the rule of the short-lived Median Empire.\n\nSoon after, Assyria was ruled by the Persian Achaemenid Empire.\n\nDuring this time, Assyria got back on its feet and became a major agricultural and administrative center of the empire.\n\nAfter some time, Assyria fell to Alexander the Great, the Macedonian Emperor.\n\nBy 150 BC, Assyria fell under the control of the Parthian Empire.\n\nDuring this period, Christianity arrived in Assyria.\n\nDuring the Christian period, Assyria fell under control of the Sasanian Empire and was invaded by the Mongols.\n\nAssyrians then suffered a number of religiously and ethnically introduced massacres, including the Simele Massacre and World War II.\n\nAssyria Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Assyria across 24 in-depth pages.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change that aims to reduce the emission of gases that contribute to global warming.", "reference_documents": ["2015 international treaty on climate change\n\nThe Paris Agreement (French: Accord de Paris), often referred to as the Paris Accords or the Paris Climate Accords, is an international treaty on climate change. Adopted in 2015, the agreement covers climate change mitigation, adaptation, and finance. The Paris Agreement was negotiated by 196 parties at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference near Paris, France. As of February 2023, 195 members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are parties to the agreement. Of the three UNFCCC member states which have not ratified the agreement, the only major emitter is Iran. The United States withdrew from the agreement in 2020, but rejoined in 2021.\n\nThe Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal is to keep the rise in mean global temperature to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) above pre-industrial levels, and preferably limit the increase to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F), recognizing that this would substantially reduce the effects of climate change. Emissions should be reduced as soon as possible and reach net zero by the middle of the 21st century.[3] To stay below 1.5 °C of global warming, emissions need to be cut by roughly 50% by 2030. This is an aggregate of each country's nationally determined contributions.[4]\n\nIt aims to help countries adapt to climate change effects, and mobilize enough finance. Under the agreement, each country must determine, plan, and regularly report on its contributions. No mechanism forces a country to set specific emissions targets, but each target should go beyond previous targets. In contrast to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the distinction between developed and developing countries is blurred, so that the latter also have to submit plans for emission reductions.\n\nThe Paris Agreement was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 (Earth Day) at a ceremony inside the UN Headquarters in New York. After the European Union ratified the agreement, sufficient countries had ratified the agreement responsible for enough of the world's greenhouse gases for the agreement to enter into force on 4 November 2016.\n\nThe agreement was lauded by world leaders, but criticized as insufficiently binding by some environmentalists and analysts. There is debate about the effectiveness of the agreement. While current pledges under the Paris Agreement are insufficient for reaching the set temperature goals, there is a mechanism of increased ambition. The Paris Agreement has been successfully used in climate litigation forcing countries and an oil company to strengthen climate action.[5][6]\n\nAims [ edit ]\n\nThe aim of the agreement, as described in Article 2, is to have a stronger response to the danger of climate change; it seeks to enhance the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change through:[7]\n\n(a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; (b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; (c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.\n\nCountries furthermore aim to reach \"global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible.\"[7]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nHeads of delegations at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris\n\nThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit is one of the first international treaties on the topic. It stipulates that parties should meet regularly to address climate change, at the Conference of Parties or COP. It forms the foundation to future climate agreements.[8]\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, regulated greenhouse gas reductions for a limited set of countries from 2008 to 2012. The protocol was extended until 2020 with the Doha Amendment in 2012.[9] The United States decided not to ratify the Protocol, mainly because of its legally-binding nature. This, and distributional conflict, led to failures of subsequent international climate negotiations. The 2009 negotiations were intended to produce a successor treaty of Kyoto, but the negotiations collapsed and the resulting Copenhagen Accord was not legally binding and did not get adopted universally.[10][11]\n\nThe Accord did lay the framework for bottom-up approach of the Paris Agreement.[10] Under the leadership of UNFCCC executive secretary Christiana Figueres, negotiation regained momentum after Copenhagen's failure.[12] During the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference, the Durban Platform was established to negotiate a legal instrument governing climate change mitigation measures from 2020. The platform had a mandate to be informed by the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC and the work of the subsidiary bodies of the UNFCCC.[13] The resulting agreement was to be adopted in 2015.[14]\n\nNegotiations and adoption [ edit ]\n\nMovie showing Laurent Fabius signalling the formal adoption of the Paris agreement\n\nNegotiations in Paris took place over a two-week span, and continued throughout the three final nights.[15][16] Various drafts and proposals had been debated and streamlined in the preceding year.[17] According to one commentator two ways in which the French increased the likelihood of success were: firstly to ensure that INDCs were completed before the start of the negotiations, and secondly to invite leaders just for the beginning of the conference.[18]\n\nThe negotiations almost failed because of a single word when the US legal team realized at the last minute that \"shall\" had been approved, rather than \"should\", meaning that developed countries would have been legally obliged to cut emissions: the French solved the problem by changing it as a \"typographical error\".[19] At the conclusion of COP21 (the 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties), on 12 December 2015, the final wording of the Paris Agreement was adopted by consensus by the 195 UNFCCC participating member states and the European Union.[20] Nicaragua indicated they had wanted to object to the adoption as they denounced the weakness of the agreement, but were not given a chance.[21][22] In the agreement the members promised to reduce their carbon output \"as soon as possible\" and to do their best to keep global warming \"to well below 2 degrees C\" (3.6 °F).[23]\n\nSigning and entry into force [ edit ]\n\nThe Paris Agreement was open for signature by states and regional economic integration organizations that are parties to the UNFCCC (the convention) from 22 April 2016 to 21 April 2017 at the UN Headquarters in New York.[24] Signing of the agreement is the first step towards ratification, but it is possible to accede to the agreement without signing.[25] It binds parties to not act in contravention of the goal of the treaty.[26] On 1 April 2016, the United States and China, which represent almost 40% of global emissions confirmed they would sign the Paris Climate Agreement.[27][28] The agreement was signed by 175 parties (174 states and the European Union) on the first day it was opened for signature.[29][30] As of March 2021, 194 states and the European Union have signed the agreement.[1]\n\nThe agreement would enter into force (and thus become fully effective) if 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions (according to a list produced in 2015)[31] ratify or otherwise join the treaty.[32][25] Alternative ways to join the treaty are acceptance, approval or accession. The first two are typically used when a head of state is not necessary to bind a country to a treaty, whereas the latter typically happens when a country joins a treaty already in force.[33] After ratification by the European Union, the agreement obtained enough parties to enter into effect on 4 November 2016.[34]\n\nBoth the EU and its member states are individually responsible for ratifying the Paris Agreement. A strong preference was reported that the EU and its 28 member states ratify at the same time to ensure that they do not engage themselves to fulfilling obligations that strictly belong to the other,[35] and there were fears by observers that disagreement over each member state's share of the EU-wide reduction target, as well as Britain's vote to leave the EU might delay the Paris pact.[36] However, the EU deposited its instruments of ratification on 5 October 2016, along with seven EU member states.[36]\n\nParties [ edit ]\n\nThe Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi greeting the President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, at the COP21 Summit on 30 November 2015\n\nThe EU and 194 states, totalling over 98% of anthropogenic emissions, have ratified or acceded to the agreement.[1][37][38] The only countries which have not ratified are some greenhouse gas emitters in the Middle East: Iran with 2% of the world total being the largest.[39] Libya and Yemen have also not ratified the agreement.[1] Eritrea is the latest country to ratify the agreement, on 7 February 2023.\n\nArticle 28 enables parties to withdraw from the agreement after sending a withdrawal notification to the depositary. Notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country. Withdrawal is effective one year after the depositary is notified.[40]\n\nUnited States withdrawal and readmittance [ edit ]\n\nOn 4 August 2017, the Trump administration delivered an official notice to the United Nations that the United States, the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China,[41] intended to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it was eligible to do so.[42] The notice of withdrawal could not be submitted until the agreement was in force for three years for the US, on 4 November 2019.[43][44] The U.S. government deposited the notification with the Secretary General of the United Nations and officially withdrew one year later on 4 November 2020.[45][46] President Joe Biden signed an executive order on his first day in office, 20 January 2021, to re-admit the United States into the Paris Agreement.[47][48] Following the 30-day period set by Article 21.3, the U.S. was readmitted to the agreement.[49][50] United States Climate Envoy John Kerry took part in virtual events, saying that the US would \"earn its way back\" into legitimacy in the Paris process.[51] United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres welcomed the return of the United States as restoring the \"missing link that weakened the whole\".[51]\n\nContent [ edit ]\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a short agreement with 16 introductory paragraphs and 29 articles. It contains procedural articles (covering, for example, the criteria for its entry into force) and operational articles (covering, for example, mitigation, adaptation and finance). It is a binding agreement, but many of its articles do not imply obligations or are there to facilitate international collaboration.[52] It covers most greenhouse gas emissions, but does not apply to international aviation and shipping, which fall under the responsibility of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization, respectively.[53]\n\nStructure [ edit ]\n\nThe Paris Agreement has been described as having a bottom-up structure, as its core pledge and review mechanism allows nations to set their own NDCs, rather than having targets imposed top down.[54][55] Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.[56] The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound. Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law. This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an \"executive agreement rather than a treaty\". Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation.[56]\n\nAnother key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scope. The Kyoto Protocol differentiated between Annex-I, richer countries with a historical responsibility for climate change, and non-Annex-I countries, but this division is blurred in the Paris Agreement as all parties are required to submit emissions reduction plans.[57] The Paris Agreement still emphasizes the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities—the acknowledgement that different nations have different capacities and duties to climate action—but it does not provide a specific division between developed and developing nations.[57]\n\nNationally determined contributions [ edit ]\n\nSince 2000, rising CO 2 emissions in China and the rest of the world have surpassed the output of the United States and Europe.\n\nPer person, the United States generates CO 2 at a far faster rate than other primary regions.\n\nCountries determine themselves what contributions they should make to achieve the aims of the treaty. As such, these plans are called nationally determined contributions (NDCs).[58] Article 3 requires NDCs to be \"ambitious efforts\" towards \"achieving the purpose of this Agreement\" and to \"represent a progression over time\".[58] The contributions should be set every five years and are to be registered by the UNFCCC Secretariat.[59] Each further ambition should be more ambitious than the previous one, known as the principle of 'progression'.[60] Countries can cooperate and pool their nationally determined contributions. The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions pledged during the 2015 Climate Change Conference are converted to NDCs when a country ratifies the Paris Agreement, unless they submit an update.[61][62]\n\nThe Paris Agreement does not prescribe the exact nature of the NDCs. At a minimum, they should contain mitigation provisions, but they may also contain pledges on adaptation, finance, technology transfer, capacity building and transparency.[63] Some of the pledges in the NDCs are unconditional, but others are conditional on outside factors such as getting finance and technical support, the ambition from other parties or the details of rules of the Paris Agreement that are yet to be set. Most NDCs have a conditional component.[64]\n\nWhile the NDCs themselves are not binding, the procedures surrounding them are. These procedures include the obligation to prepare, communicate and maintain successive NDCs, set a new one every five years, and provide information about the implementation.[65] There is no mechanism to force[66] a country to set a NDC target by a specific date, nor to meet their targets.[67][68] There will be only a name and shame system[69] or as János Pásztor, the former U.N. assistant secretary-general on climate change, stated, a \"name and encourage\" plan.[70]\n\nGlobal stocktake [ edit ]\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries must increase their ambition every five years. To facilitate this, the agreement established the Global Stocktake, which assesses progress, with the first evaluation in 2023. The outcome is to be used as input for new nationally determined contributions of parties.[71] The Talanoa Dialogue in 2018 was seen as an example for the global stocktake.[72] After a year of discussion, a report was published and there was a call for action, but countries did not increase ambition afterwards.[73]\n\nThe stocktake works as part of the Paris Agreement's effort to create a \"ratcheting up\" of ambition in emissions cuts. Because analysts agreed in 2014 that the NDCs would not limit rising temperatures below 2 °C, the global stocktake reconvenes parties to assess how their new NDCs must evolve so that they continually reflect a country's \"highest possible ambition\".[74] While ratcheting up the ambition of NDCs is a major aim of the global stocktake, it assesses efforts beyond mitigation. The 5-year reviews will also evaluate adaptation, climate finance provisions, and technology development and transfer.[74]\n\nMitigation provisions and carbon markets [ edit ]\n\nArticle 6 has been flagged as containing some of the key provisions of the Paris Agreement.[75] Broadly, it outlines the cooperative approaches that parties can take in achieving their nationally determined carbon emissions reductions. In doing so, it helps establish the Paris Agreement as a framework for a global carbon market.[76] Article 6 is the only important part of the agreement yet to be resolved; negotiations in 2019 did not produce a result.[77] The topic was settled during the 2021 COP26 in Glasgow. A mechanism, the \"corresponding adjustment\", was established to avoid double counting for emission offsets.[78]\n\nLinkage of carbon trading systems and ITMOs [ edit ]\n\nParagraphs 6.2 and 6.3 establish a framework to govern the international transfer of mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). The agreement recognizes the rights of parties to use emissions reductions outside of their own borders toward their NDC, in a system of carbon accounting and trading.[76] This provision requires the \"linkage\" of carbon emissions trading systems—because measured emissions reductions must avoid \"double counting\", transferred mitigation outcomes must be recorded as a gain of emission units for one party and a reduction of emission units for the other,[75] a so called \"corresponding adjustment\".[79] Because the NDCs, and domestic carbon trading schemes, are heterogeneous, the ITMOs will provide a format for global linkage under the auspices of the UNFCCC.[80] The provision thus also creates a pressure for countries to adopt emissions management systems—if a country wants to use more cost-effective cooperative approaches to achieve their NDCs, they will have to monitor carbon units for their economies.[81]\n\nSo far, as the only country who wants to buy ITMOs, Switzerland has signed deals regarding ITMO tradings with Peru, Ghana, Senegal, Georgia, Dominica, Vanuatu, Thailand and Ukraine.\n\nCountry Sign date Source Peru 20 October 2020 [82] Ghana 23 November 2020 [83] Senegal 6 July 2021 [84] Georgia 18 October 2021 [85] Dominica 11 November 2021 [86] Vanuatu 11 November 2021 [86] Thailand 24 June 2022 [86] Ukraine 4 July 2022 [86]\n\nSustainable Development Mechanism [ edit ]\n\nParagraphs 6.4-6.7 establish a mechanism \"to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gases and support sustainable development\".[87] Though there is no official name for the mechanism as yet, it has been referred to as the Sustainable Development Mechanism or SDM.[88][77] The SDM is considered to be the successor to the Clean Development Mechanism, a mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol by which parties could collaboratively pursue emissions reductions.[89]\n\nThe SDM is set to largely resemble the Clean Development Mechanism, with the dual goal of contributing to global GHG emissions reductions and supporting sustainable development.[90] Though the structure and processes governing the SDM are not yet determined, certain similarities and differences from the Clean Development Mechanisms have become clear. A key difference is that the SDM will be available to all parties as opposed to only Annex-I parties, making it much wider in scope.[91]\n\nThe Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol was criticized for failing to produce either meaningful emissions reductions or sustainable development benefits in most instances.[92] and for its complexity. It is possible that the SDM will see difficulties.[80]\n\nClimate change adaptation provisions [ edit ]\n\nClimate change adaptation received more focus in Paris negotiations than in previous climate treaties. Collective, long-term adaptation goals are included in the agreement, and countries must report on their adaptation actions, making it a parallel component with mitigation.[93] The adaptation goals focus on enhancing adaptive capacity, increasing resilience, and limiting vulnerability.[94]\n\nSpecific topics of concern [ edit ]\n\nEnsuring finance [ edit ]\n\nPledges to the Green Climate Fund in 2018. The numbers represent the signed pledges per year.\n\nDeveloped countries reaffirmed the commitment to mobilize $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020, and agreed to continue mobilising finance at this level until 2025.[95] The money is for supporting mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.[96] It includes finance for the Green Climate Fund, which is a part of the UNFCCC, but also for a variety of other public and private pledges. The Paris Agreement states that a new commitment of at least $100 billion per year has to be agreed before 2025.[97]\n\nThough both mitigation and adaptation require increased climate financing, adaptation has typically received lower levels of support and has mobilized less action from the private sector.[93] A report by the OECD found that 16% of global climate finance was directed toward climate adaptation in 2013–2014, compared to 77% for mitigation.[98] The Paris Agreement called for a balance of climate finance between adaptation and mitigation, and specifically increasing adaptation support for parties most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including Least developed countries and Small Island Developing States. The agreement also reminds parties of the importance of public grants, because adaptation measures receive less investment from the public sector.[93]\n\nIn 2015, twenty Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and members of the International Development Finance Club introduced five principles to maintain widespread climate action in their investments: commitment to climate strategies, managing climate risks, promoting climate smart objectives, improving climate performance and accounting for their own actions. As of January 2020, the number of members abiding by these principles grew to 44.[99]\n\nSome specific outcomes of the elevated attention to adaptation financing in Paris include the G7 countries' announcement to provide US$420 million for climate risk insurance, and the launching of a Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Initiative.[100] The largest donors to multilateral climate funds, which includes the Green Climate Fund, are the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France and Sweden.[101]\n\nLoss and damage [ edit ]\n\nIt is not possible to adapt to all effects of climate change: even in the case of optimal adaptation, severe damage may still occur. The Paris Agreement recognizes loss and damage of this kind.[102] Loss and damage can stem from extreme weather events, or from slow-onset events such as the loss of land to sea level rise for low-lying islands.[56] Previous climate agreements classified loss and damage as a subset of adaptation.[102]\n\nThe push to address loss and damage as a distinct issue in the Paris Agreement came from the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries, whose economies and livelihoods are most vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change.[56] The Warsaw Mechanism, established two years earlier during COP19 and set to expire in 2016, categorizes loss and damage as a subset of adaptation, which was unpopular with many countries. It is recognized as a separate pillar of the Paris Agreement.[103] The United States argued against this, possibly worried that classifying the issue as separate from adaptation would create yet another climate finance provision.[56] In the end, the agreement calls for \"averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage\"[7] but specifies that it cannot be used as the basis for liability. The agreement adopts the Warsaw Mechanism, an institution that will attempt to address questions about how to classify, address, and share responsibility for loss.[102]\n\nTransparency [ edit ]\n\nThe parties are legally bound to have their progress tracked by technical expert review to assess achievement toward the NDC and to determine ways to strengthen ambition.[104] Article 13 of the Paris Agreement articulates an \"enhanced transparency framework for action and support\" that establishes harmonized monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) requirements. Both developed and developing nations must report every two years on their mitigation efforts, and all parties will be subject to technical and peer review.[104]\n\nWhile the enhanced transparency framework is universal, the framework is meant to provide \"built-in flexibility\" to distinguish between developed and developing countries' capacities. The Paris Agreement has provisions for an enhanced framework for capacity building, recognizes the varying circumstances of countries, and notes that the technical expert review for each country consider that country's specific capacity for reporting.[105] Parties to the agreement send their first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR), and greenhouse gas inventory figures to the UNFCCC by 2024 and every two years after that. Developed countries submit their first BTR in 2022 and inventories annually from that year.[106] The agreement also develops a Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency to assist developing countries in building the necessary institutions and processes for compliance.[105]\n\nFlexibility can be incorporated into the enhanced transparency framework via the scope, level of detail, or frequency of reporting, tiered based on a country's capacity. The requirement for in-country technical reviews could be lifted for some less developed or small island developing countries. Ways to assess capacity include financial and human resources in a country necessary for NDC review.[105]\n\nLitigation [ edit ]\n\nThe Paris Agreement has become a focal point of climate change litigation. One of the first major cases in this area was State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda Foundation, which was raised against the Netherlands' government after it had reduced its planned emissions reductions goal for 2030 prior to the Paris Agreement. After an initial ruling against the government in 2015 that required it to maintain its planned reduction, the decision was upheld on appeals through the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 2019, ruling that the Dutch government failed to uphold human rights under Dutch law and the European Convention on Human Rights by lowering its emission targets.[5] The 2 °C temperature target of the Paris Agreement provided part of the judgement's legal basis.[107] The agreement, whose goals are enshrined in German law, also formed part of the argumentation in Neubauer et al. v. Germany, where the court ordered Germany to reconsider its climate targets.[108]\n\nIn May 2021, the district court of The Hague ruled against oil company Royal Dutch Shell in Milieudefensie et al v Royal Dutch Shell. The court ruled that it must cut its global emissions by 45% from 2019 levels by 2030, as it was in violation of human rights. This lawsuit was considered the first major application of the Paris Agreement towards a corporation.[6]\n\nHuman rights [ edit ]\n\nOn 4 July 2022, the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil recognized the Paris agreement as a \"human rights treaty\". According to the ruling of the court in Brazil it should \"supersede national law\".[109][110] In the same month the United Nations Human Rights Council in a resolution \"(A/HRC/50/L.10/Rev.1) on Human rights and climate change, adopted without a vote\" called to ratify and implement the agreement and emphasized the link between stopping climate change and the right to food.[111]\n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights officially recognized that \"Climate change threatens the effective enjoyment of a range of human rights including those to life, water and sanitation, food, health, housing, self-determination, culture and development.\"[112]\n\nImplementation [ edit ]\n\nThe Paris Agreement is implemented via national policy. It would involve improvements to energy efficiency to decrease the energy intensity of the global economy. Implementation also requires fossil fuel burning to be cut back and the share of sustainable energy to grow rapidly. Emissions are being reduced rapidly in the electricity sector, but not in the building, transport and heating sector. Some industries are difficult to decarbonize, and for those carbon dioxide removal may be necessary to achieve net zero emissions.[113] In a report released in 2022 the IPCC promotes the need for innovation and technological changes in combination with consumption and production behavioral changes to meet Paris Agreement objectives.[114]\n\nTo stay below 1.5 °C of global warming, emissions need to be cut by roughly 50% by 2030. This is an aggregate of each country's nationally determined contributions. By mid-century, CO 2 emissions would need to be cut to zero, and total greenhouse gases would need to be net zero just after mid-century.[4]\n\nThere are barriers to implementing the agreement. Some countries struggle to attract the finance necessary for investments in decarbonization. Climate finance is fragmented, further complicating investments. Another issue is the lack of capabilities in government and other institutions to implement policy. Clean technology and knowledge is often not transferred to countries or places that need it.[113] In December 2020, the former chair of the COP 21, Laurent Fabius, argued that the implementation of the Paris Agreement could be bolstered by the adoption of a Global Pact for the Environment.[115] The latter would define the environmental rights and duties of states, individuals and businesses.[116]\n\nFulfillment of requirements [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2021, the Climate Action Tracker estimated that, with current policies, global emissions will double above the 2030 target level. The gap is 20-23 Gt CO2e. Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Thailand are on track to achieve a 4°C warming of the planet if implemented more widely. Other countries are not doing enough. Of the world's countries, only the Gambia is at the level of the Paris Agreement. With measures implemented by autumn 2021, the global average temperature will rise by 2.9°C; even with the Paris Agreement pledges, the average temperature will rise by 2.4°C; and with all the zero emission targets on the table, the average temperature will rise by 2.0°C.[117]\n\nThe Production Gap 2021 report states that world governments still plan to produce 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 (including 240% more coal, 57% more oil and 71% more gas) than the 1.5 degree limit.[118]\n\nIn September 2023 the first global stocktake report about the implementation of the agreement was released. According to the report contrarily to expectations, the agreement has a significant effect: while in 2010 the expected temperature rise by 2100 was 3.7–4.8 °C, at COP 27 it was 2.4–2.6°C and if all countries will fulfill their long-term pledges 1.7–2.1 °C. However, the world is still very far from limiting warming to 1.5 degrees: for this emissions must peak by 2025 and even though emissions really peaked in many countries, global emissions did not.[119][120]\n\nReception and debates [ edit ]\n\nThe agreement was lauded by French President François Hollande, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC.[121] The president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, called the agreement \"balanced and long-lasting\",[122] and India's prime minister Narendra Modi commended the agreement's climate justice.[123][124] When the agreement achieved the required signatures in October 2016, US President Barack Obama said that \"Even if we meet every target, we will only get to part of where we need to go.\"[125] He also stated \"this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change [and] will help other nations ratchet down their emissions over time.\"[125]\n\nSome environmentalists and analysts reacted cautiously, acknowledging the \"spirit of Paris\" in bringing together countries, but expressing less optimism about the pace of climate mitigation and how much the agreement could do for poorer countries.[126] James Hansen, a former NASA scientist and leading climate change expert, voiced anger that most of the agreement consists of \"promises\" or aims and not firm commitments and called the Paris talks a fraud with \"no action, just promises\".[127] Criticism of the agreement from those arguing against climate action has been diffuse, which may be due to the weakness of the agreement. This type of criticism typically focusses on national sovereignty and ineffectiveness of international action.\n\nEffectiveness [ edit ]\n\nScenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions. If all countries achieve their current Paris Agreement pledges, average warming by 2100 would still exceed the maximum 2°C target set by the agreement.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Paris Agreement to reach its climate goals is under debate, with most experts saying it is insufficient for its more ambitious goal of keeping global temperature rise under 1.5 °C.[128][129] Many of the exact provisions of the Paris Agreement have yet to be straightened out, so that it may be too early to judge effectiveness.[128] According to the 2020 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), with the current climate commitments of the Paris Agreement, global mean temperatures will likely rise by more than 3 °C by the end of the 21st century. Newer net zero commitments were not included in the NDCs, and may bring down temperatures a further 0.5 °C.[130]\n\nWith initial pledges by countries inadequate, faster and more expensive future mitigation would be needed to still reach the targets.[131] Furthermore, there is a gap between pledges by countries in their NDCs and implementation of these pledges; one third of the emission gap between the lowest-costs and actual reductions in emissions would be closed by implementing existing pledges.[132] A pair of studies in Nature found that as of 2017 none of the major industrialized nations were implementing the policies they had pledged, and none met their pledged emission reduction targets,[133] and even if they had, the sum of all member pledges (as of 2016) would not keep global temperature rise \"well below 2 °C\".[134][135]\n\nIn 2021, a study using a probabilistic model concluded that the rates of emissions reductions would have to increase by 80% beyond NDCs to likely meet the 2 °C upper target of the Paris Agreement, that the probabilities of major emitters meeting their NDCs without such an increase is very low. It estimated that with current trends the probability of staying below 2 °C of warming is 5% – and 26% if NDCs were met and continued post-2030 by all signatories.[136]\n\nAs of 2020 , there is little scientific literature on the topics of the effectiveness of the Paris Agreement on capacity building and adaptation, even though they feature prominently in the Paris Agreement. The literature available is mostly mixed in its conclusions about loss and damage, and adaptation.[128]\n\nAccording to the stocktake report, the agreement has a significant effect: while in 2010 the expected temperature rise by 2100 was 3.7–4.8 °C, at COP 27 it was 2.4–2.6°C and if all countries will fulfill their long-term pledges even 1.7–2.1 °C. Despite it, the world is still very far from reaching the aim of the agreement: limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. For doing this, emissions must peak by 2025.[119][120]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]"], "label": "S", "category": "ExpertQA", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": " The weak interaction is one of the four fundamental forces of nature that governs some forms of radioactivity and the decay of unstable subatomic particles.", "reference_documents": ["Interaction between subatomic particles and one of the four known fundamental interactions\n\nThe radioactive beta decay is due to the weak interaction, which transforms a neutron into a proton, an electron, and an electron antineutrino.\n\nIn nuclear physics and particle physics, the weak interaction, which is also often called the weak force or weak nuclear force, is one of the four known fundamental interactions, with the others being electromagnetism, the strong interaction, and gravitation. It is the mechanism of interaction between subatomic particles that is responsible for the radioactive decay of atoms: The weak interaction participates in nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. The theory describing its behaviour and effects is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD); however, the term QFD is rarely used, because the weak force is better understood by electroweak theory (EWT).[1]\n\nThe effective range of the weak force is limited to subatomic distances and is less than the diameter of a proton.[2]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nThe Standard Model of particle physics provides a uniform framework for understanding electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. An interaction occurs when two particles (typically, but not necessarily, half-integer spin fermions) exchange integer-spin, force-carrying bosons. The fermions involved in such exchanges can be either elementary (e.g. electrons or quarks) or composite (e.g. protons or neutrons), although at the deepest levels, all weak interactions ultimately are between elementary particles.\n\nIn the weak interaction, fermions can exchange three types of force carriers, namely W+, W−, and Z bosons. The masses of these bosons are far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force.[3] In fact, the force is termed weak because its field strength over any set distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the electromagnetic force, which itself is further orders of magnitude less than the strong nuclear force.\n\nThe weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity symmetry, and similarly, but far more rarely, the only interaction to break charge–parity symmetry.\n\nQuarks, which make up composite particles like neutrons and protons, come in six \"flavours\" – up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom – which give those composite particles their properties. The weak interaction is unique in that it allows quarks to swap their flavour for another. The swapping of those properties is mediated by the force carrier bosons. For example, during beta-minus decay, a down quark within a neutron is changed into an up quark, thus converting the neutron to a proton and resulting in the emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino.\n\nWeak interaction is important in the fusion of hydrogen into helium in a star. This is because it can convert a proton (hydrogen) into a neutron to form deuterium which is important for the continuation of nuclear fusion to form helium. The accumulation of neutrons facilitates the buildup of heavy nuclei in a star.[3]\n\nMost fermions decay by a weak interaction over time. Such decay makes radiocarbon dating possible, as carbon-14 decays through the weak interaction to nitrogen-14. It can also create radioluminescence, commonly used in tritium luminescence, and in the related field of betavoltaics[4] (but not similar radium luminescence).\n\nThe electroweak force is believed to have separated into the electromagnetic and weak forces during the quark epoch of the early universe.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nIn 1933, Enrico Fermi proposed the first theory of the weak interaction, known as Fermi's interaction. He suggested that beta decay could be explained by a four-fermion interaction, involving a contact force with no range.[5][6]\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee first suggested that the handedness of the spins of particles in weak interaction might violate the conservation law or symmetry. In 1957, Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators confirmed the symmetry violation.[7]\n\nIn the 1960s, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg unified the electromagnetic force and the weak interaction by showing them to be two aspects of a single force, now termed the electroweak force.[8][9]\n\nThe existence of the W and Z bosons was not directly confirmed until 1983.[10](p8)\n\nProperties [ edit ]\n\nA diagram depicting the decay routes due to the charged weak interaction and some indication of their likelihood. The intensity of the lines is given by the CKM parameters.\n\nThe electrically charged weak interaction is unique in a number of respects:\n\nDue to their large mass (approximately 90 GeV/c2[11]) these carrier particles, called the W and Z bosons, are short-lived with a lifetime of under 10−24 seconds.[12] The weak interaction has a coupling constant (an indicator of how frequently interactions occur) between 10−7 and 10−6, compared to the electromagnetic coupling constant of about 10−2 and the strong interaction coupling constant of 1;[13] consequently the weak interaction is \"weak\" in terms of intensity.[14] The weak interaction has a very short effective range (around 10−17 to 10−16 m (0.01 to 0.1 fm)).[b][14][13] At distances around 10−18 meters (0.001 fm), the weak interaction has an intensity of a similar magnitude to the electromagnetic force, but this starts to decrease exponentially with increasing distance. Scaled up by just one and a half orders of magnitude, at distances of around 3×10−17 m, the weak interaction becomes 10,000 times weaker.[15]\n\nThe weak interaction affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, as well as the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact only through gravity and the weak interaction. The weak interaction does not produce bound states, nor does it involve binding energy – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, the electromagnetic force does at the molecular and atomic levels, and the strong nuclear force does only at the subatomic level, inside of nuclei.[16]\n\nIts most noticeable effect is due to its first unique feature: The charged weak interaction causes flavour change. For example, a neutron is heavier than a proton (its partner nucleon) and can decay into a proton by changing the flavour (type) of one of its two down quarks to an up quark. Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this can only proceed by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the strange quark and charm quark, respectively) would also be conserved across all interactions.\n\nAll mesons are unstable because of weak decay.[10](p29)[c] In the process known as beta decay, a down quark in the neutron can change into an up quark by emitting a virtual\n\nW−\n\nboson, which then decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino.[10](p28) Another example is electron capture – a common variant of radioactive decay – wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact and are changed to a neutron (an up quark is changed to a down quark), and an electron neutrino is emitted.\n\nDue to the large masses of the W bosons, particle transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces.[d] For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16 seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8 seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion.[10](p30) A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15 minutes.[10](p28)\n\nWeak isospin and weak hypercharge [ edit ]\n\nAll particles have a property called weak isospin (symbol T 3 ), which serves as an additive quantum number that restricts how the particle can interact with the\n\nW±\n\nof the weak force. Weak isospin plays the same role in the weak interaction with\n\nW±\n\nas electric charge does in electromagnetism, and color charge in the strong interaction; a different number with a similar name, weak charge, discussed below, is used for interactions with the\n\nZ0\n\n. All left-handed fermions have a weak isospin value of either ++1/2 or −+1/2; all right-handed fermions have 0 isospin. For example, the up quark has T 3 = ++1/2 and the down quark has T 3 = −+1/2. A quark never decays through the weak interaction into a quark of the same T 3 : Quarks with a T 3 of ++1/2 only decay into quarks with a T 3 of −+1/2 and conversely.\n\n\n\nπ +\n\ndecay through the weak interaction\n\nIn any given strong, electromagnetic, or weak interaction, weak isospin is conserved:[e] The sum of the weak isospin numbers of the particles entering the interaction equals the sum of the weak isospin numbers of the particles exiting that interaction. For example, a (left-handed)\n\nπ+\n\n, with a weak isospin of +1 normally decays into a\n\nν\n\nμ (with T 3 = ++1/2) and a\n\nμ+\n\n(as a right-handed antiparticle, ++1/2).[10](p30)\n\nFor the development of the electroweak theory, another property, weak hypercharge, was invented, defined as\n\nY W = 2 ( Q − T 3 ) , {\\displaystyle Y_{\\text{W}}=2\\,(Q-T_{3}),}\n\nwhere Y W is the weak hypercharge of a particle with electrical charge Q (in elementary charge units) and weak isospin T 3 . Weak hypercharge is the generator of the U(1) component of the electroweak gauge group; whereas some particles have a weak isospin of zero, all known spin- 1/2 particles have a non-zero weak hypercharge.[f]\n\nInteraction types [ edit ]\n\nThere are two types of weak interaction (called vertices). The first type is called the \"charged-current interaction\" because the weakly interacting fermions form a current with total electric charge that is nonzero. The second type is called the \"neutral-current interaction\" because the weakly interacting fermions form a current with total electric charge of zero. It is responsible for the (rare) deflection of neutrinos. The two types of interaction follow different selection rules. This naming convention is often misunderstood to label the electric charge of the W and Z bosons, however the naming convention predates the concept of the mediator bosons, and clearly (at least in name) labels the charge of the current (formed from the fermions), not necessarily the bosons.[g]\n\nCharged-current interaction [ edit ]\n\nThe Feynman diagram for beta-minus decay of a neutron ( n = udd ) into a proton ( p = udu ), electron ( e− ), and electron anti-neutrino ( ν ¯ e ) {\\displaystyle (\\ {\\bar {\n\nu }}_{\\mathrm {e} }\\ )}\n\nW −\n\n).\n\nIn one type of charged current interaction, a charged lepton (such as an electron or a muon, having a charge of −1) can absorb a\n\nW+\n\nboson (a particle with a charge of +1) and be thereby converted into a corresponding neutrino (with a charge of 0), where the type (\"flavour\") of neutrino (electron ν e {\\displaystyle\n\nu _{\\mathrm {e} }} , muon ν μ {\\displaystyle\n\nu _{\\mu }} , or tau ν τ {\\displaystyle\n\nu _{\\tau }} ) is the same as the type of lepton in the interaction, for example:\n\nμ − + W + → ν μ {\\displaystyle \\mu ^{-}+\\mathrm {W} ^{+}\\to\n\nu _{\\mu }}\n\nSimilarly, a down-type quark (d, s, or b, with a charge of −+ 1 /3) can be converted into an up-type quark (u, c, or t, with a charge of ++ 2 /3), by emitting a\n\nW−\n\nboson or by absorbing a\n\nW+\n\nboson. More precisely, the down-type quark becomes a quantum superposition of up-type quarks: that is to say, it has a possibility of becoming any one of the three up-type quarks, with the probabilities given in the CKM matrix tables. Conversely, an up-type quark can emit a\n\nW+\n\nboson, or absorb a\n\nW−\n\nboson, and thereby be converted into a down-type quark, for example:\n\nd → u + W − d + W + → u c → s + W + c + W − → s {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\\mathrm {d} &\\to \\mathrm {u} +\\mathrm {W} ^{-}\\\\\\mathrm {d} +\\mathrm {W} ^{+}&\\to \\mathrm {u} \\\\\\mathrm {c} &\\to \\mathrm {s} +\\mathrm {W} ^{+}\\\\\\mathrm {c} +\\mathrm {W} ^{-}&\\to \\mathrm {s} \\end{aligned}}}\n\nThe W boson is unstable so will rapidly decay, with a very short lifetime. For example:\n\nW − → e − + ν ¯ e W + → e + + ν e {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\\mathrm {W} ^{-}&\\to \\mathrm {e} ^{-}+{\\bar {\n\nu }}_{\\mathrm {e} }~\\\\\\mathrm {W} ^{+}&\\to \\mathrm {e} ^{+}+\n\nu _{\\mathrm {e} }~\\end{aligned}}}\n\nDecay of a W boson to other products can happen, with varying probabilities.[18]\n\nIn the so-called beta decay of a neutron (see picture, above), a down quark within the neutron emits a virtual\n\nW−\n\nboson and is thereby converted into an up quark, converting the neutron into a proton. Because of the limited energy involved in the process (i.e., the mass difference between the down quark and the up quark), the virtual\n\nW−\n\nboson can only carry sufficient energy to produce an electron and an electron-antineutrino – the two lowest-possible masses among its prospective decay products.[19] At the quark level, the process can be represented as:\n\nd → u + e − + ν ¯ e {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} \\to \\mathrm {u} +\\mathrm {e} ^{-}+{\\bar {\n\nu }}_{\\mathrm {e} }~}\n\nNeutral-current interaction [ edit ]\n\nIn neutral current interactions, a quark or a lepton (e.g., an electron or a muon) emits or absorbs a neutral Z boson. For example:\n\ne − → e − + Z 0 {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {e} ^{-}\\to \\mathrm {e} ^{-}+\\mathrm {Z} ^{0}}\n\nLike the\n\nW±\n\nbosons, the\n\nZ0\n\nboson also decays rapidly,[18] for example:\n\nZ 0 → b + b ¯ {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Z} ^{0}\\to \\mathrm {b} +{\\bar {\\mathrm {b} }}}\n\nUnlike the charged-current interaction, whose selection rules are strictly limited by chirality, electric charge, and / or weak isospin, the neutral-current\n\nZ0\n\ninteraction can cause any two fermions in the standard model to deflect: Either particles or anti-particles, with any electric charge, and both left- and right-chirality, although the strength of the interaction differs.[h]\n\nThe quantum number weak charge (Q W ) serves the same role in the neutral current interaction with the\n\nZ0\n\nthat electric charge (Q, with no subscript) does in the electromagnetic interaction: It quantifies the vector part of the interaction. Its value is given by:[21]\n\nQ w = 2 T 3 − 4 Q sin 2 ⁡ θ w = 2 T 3 − Q + ( 1 − 4 sin 2 ⁡ θ w ) Q . {\\displaystyle Q_{\\mathsf {w}}=2\\,T_{3}-4\\,Q\\,\\sin ^{2}\\theta _{\\mathsf {w}}=2\\,T_{3}-Q+(1-4\\,\\sin ^{2}\\theta _{\\mathsf {w}})\\,Q~.}\n\nSince the weak mixing angle θ w ≈ 29 ∘ , {\\displaystyle \\ \\theta _{\\mathsf {w}}\\approx 29^{\\circ }\\ ,} the parenthetic expression ( 1 − 4 sin 2 ⁡ θ w ) ≈ 0.060 , {\\displaystyle \\ (1-4\\,\\sin ^{2}\\theta _{\\mathsf {w}})\\approx 0.060\\ ,} with its value varying slightly with the momentum difference (called “running”) between the particles involved. Hence\n\nQ w ≈ 2 T 3 − Q = sgn ⁡ ( Q ) ( 1 − | Q | ) , {\\displaystyle \\ Q_{\\mathsf {w}}\\approx 2\\ T_{3}-Q=\\operatorname {sgn}(Q)\\ {\\big (}1-|Q|{\\big )}\\ ,}\n\nsince by convention sgn ⁡ T 3 ≡ sgn ⁡ Q , {\\displaystyle \\ \\operatorname {sgn} T_{3}\\equiv \\operatorname {sgn} Q\\ ,} and for all fermions involved in the weak interaction T 3 = ± 1 2 . {\\displaystyle \\ T_{3}=\\pm {\\tfrac {1}{2}}~.} The weak charge of charged leptons is then close to zero, so these mostly interact with the Z boson through the axial coupling.\n\nElectroweak theory [ edit ]\n\nThe Standard Model of particle physics describes the electromagnetic interaction and the weak interaction as two different aspects of a single electroweak interaction. This theory was developed around 1968 by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg, and they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work.[22] The Higgs mechanism provides an explanation for the presence of three massive gauge bosons (\n\nW+\n\n,\n\nW−\n\n,\n\nZ0\n\n, the three carriers of the weak interaction), and the photon (γ, the massless gauge boson that carries the electromagnetic interaction).[23]\n\nAccording to the electroweak theory, at very high energies, the universe has four components of the Higgs field whose interactions are carried by four massless gauge bosons – each similar to the photon – forming a complex scalar Higgs field doublet. Likewise, there are four massless electroweak bosons. However, at low energies, this gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the U(1) symmetry of electromagnetism, since one of the Higgs fields acquires a vacuum expectation value. Naïvely, the symmetry-breaking would be expected to produce three massless bosons, but instead those \"extra\" three Higgs bosons become incorporated into the three weak bosons, which then acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism. These three composite bosons are the\n\nW+\n\n,\n\nW−\n\n, and\n\nZ0\n\nbosons actually observed in the weak interaction. The fourth electroweak gauge boson is the photon (γ) of electromagnetism, which does not couple to any of the Higgs fields and so remains massless.[23]\n\nThis theory has made a number of predictions, including a prediction of the masses of the\n\nZ\n\nand\n\nW\n\nbosons before their discovery and detection in 1983.\n\nOn 4 July 2012, the CMS and the ATLAS experimental teams at the Large Hadron Collider independently announced that they had confirmed the formal discovery of a previously unknown boson of mass between 125 and 127 GeV/c², whose behaviour so far was \"consistent with\" a Higgs boson, while adding a cautious note that further data and analysis were needed before positively identifying the new boson as being a Higgs boson of some type. By 14 March 2013, a Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed to exist.[24]\n\nIn a speculative case where the electroweak symmetry breaking scale were lowered, the unbroken SU(2) interaction would eventually become confining. Alternative models where SU(2) becomes confining above that scale appear quantitatively similar to the Standard Model at lower energies, but dramatically different above symmetry breaking.[25]\n\nViolation of symmetry [ edit ]\n\nLeft- and right-handed particles: p is the particle's momentum and S is its spin. Note the lack of reflective symmetry between the states.\n\nThe laws of nature were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results of an experiment viewed via a mirror were expected to be identical to the results of a separately constructed, mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus watched through the mirror. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law.[26] However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.[27]\n\nAlthough the weak interaction was once described by Fermi's theory, the discovery of parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V − A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. The V − A theory was developed before the discovery of the Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.\n\nHowever, this theory allowed a compound symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics.[28] In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required more than two generations of particles,[29] effectively predicting the existence of a then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics.[30]\n\nUnlike parity violation, CP violation occurs only in rare circumstances. Despite its limited occurrence under present conditions, it is widely believed to be the reason that there is much more matter than antimatter in the universe, and thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.[31]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nSources [ edit ]\n\nTechnical [ edit ]\n\nKane, G.

The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce who developed heliography and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.[3][4] Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art).[5] Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.[6]\n\n[2] In a 2013 blog post for Fstoppers, professional retoucher Pratik Naik described the painstaking process as such:\n“Need to zoom into a photo? Be sure to bust out the magnifying glass and a bottle of patience along with that steady hand of yours. No sorry, there’s no history states or layers. You can also forget about that wonderful healing brush! Here’s a paint brush instead”\nArt directors, graphic designers, and publishers labored long hours over images, attempting to perfect skin, materials, and other issues which, today, would be easily whisked away with the click of a mouse. Tools like paint, erasers, airbrushes, and other art supplies were necessary in any studio — as was a steady hand and a keen eye for color and shadow. You can even see some of the hard work that went into perfecting photos in this annotation of a famous Dennis Stock image, which has been marked up by Pablo Inirio.\n\n[3] MIA FINEMAN: Most of the earliest manipulated photographs were attempts to compensate for the new medium’s technical limitations — specifically, its inability to depict the world as it appears to the naked eye.\nWhen photography was first introduced in 1839, people wondered how a medium that could render forms and textures with such exquisite detail could fail to register the ever-present element of color. Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives — one exposed for the land, the other for the sky — and print them together on a single sheet of paper. The French photographer Gustave Le Gray used this technique in his majestic seascapes of the 1850s. The exhibition features three seascapes by Le Gray, all using the same cloud negative. The show also includes a great pair of before-and-after landscapes by the American photographer Carleton Watkins — one with a blank white sky, the other with added clouds."], "label": "S", "category": "Lfqa", "additional_info": ""}

On the coasts of seas, lakes and rivers, you could simply aim to one direction and count your steps, trying not to deviate as much from the straight line, writing down the angular directions of every 100, 500, 1000 or more steps. Drawing an accurate coastline on mid-size maps of a tropical region and small maps of temperate regions is then trivial – draw a grid of small squares, mark your starting point, draw a continuous segmented line throughout the grid, with one segment being the fixed amount of steps you walked in one fixed direction.\n\n[3] Mapping land regions from within was exceptionally accurate even in ancient times mainly because one could determine walking distances with a very high degree of accuracy. It was also often possible to create a very detailed and accurate map of more than a hundred square miles of land in a very short time just by climbing on a mountain of a decent height and looking around.\n\n[4] However, on the open sea, there are no discernible landforms one could peg his location to, and therefore determining the location of a ship on a latitude and longitude grid was always the only way to accurely estimate the distances between different continents and archipelagos."], "label": "S", "category": "Lfqa", "additional_info": ""}

Tens of millions of people died in World War II, in which Germany was an aggressor. Six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.\nAfter 1945, democracy returned to Germany, at least in the west of the country. There, the Basic Law was adopted in 1949.

However, it is necessary to study the history of photo editing to know where it all began and in which direction to move on in the future.\n\n[4] Ansel Adams employed some of the more common manipulations using darkroom exposure techniques, burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.[1][2] Other examples of photo manipulation include retouching photographs using ink or paint, airbrushing, double exposure, piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, scratching instant films, or through the use of software-based manipulation tools applied to digital images.

Enzymes readily metabolize sucrose, releasing energy and, if our diet contains excess calories, causing fat deposition.\nSaccharin, once the most popular artificial sweetener, binds to T1r3 much more strongly than does sucrose, owing to the differing structures of the two molecules. Therefore, we sense saccharin as being approximately 300 times as sweet as the same amount of sucrose. Moreover, saccharin passes through the body without being metabolized and thus has no caloric content.\nAspartame (NutraSweet^TM), currently the most-used artificial sweetener, also binds to T1r3 more strongly than sucrose does and tastes nearly 200 times as sweet. Unlike saccharin, however, aspartame is metabolized, yielding methanol and the amino acids phenylalanine and aspartic acid. Further metabolism of these products does yield calories, but far fewer than those obtained from the amount of sucrose required to produce the same sweetening effect.\n\n[2] Calories are a measure of the energy made available when we digest and metabolize food. The energy drives the replacement of molecules we have lost, enables us to move, and so forth; we store excess energy as fat. A substance that we do not metabolize releases no energy it \"has no calories\" and is not a food.\nA sweet taste results from the binding of molecules to specific receptor proteins in our taste buds. Sweet-taste-sensory cells in the taste buds have these receptor protein molecules embedded in their plasma membranes. Binding of a molecule to a receptor protein initiates a cascade of events within the taste-sensory cell that eventually releases a signaling molecule to an adjoining sensory neuron, causing the neuron to send impulses to the brain. Within the brain, these signals derived from the taste bud cause the actual sensation of sweetness. Other sensory cells, with different receptor proteins, report on other taste modalities: salty, sour, bitter, and \"umami\" (also referred to as glutamate, or \"meat\").\nThe events that occur between binding by the \"sweet receptor\" and the sensation in the brain have nothing to do with whether a molecule can be metabolized to yield energy and thus \"has calories.\" The only"], "label": "S", "category": "Lfqa", "additional_info": ""}

But there’s really nothing “elaborate” about it; it’s actually pretty simple. “It’s a type of psychological pricing,” says Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. “Because we read from left to right, we pay less attention to the end of the number versus the beginning.” This is especially effective if you’re just quickly perusing several prices in a row; the first number will definitely stand out to you more. Psychological pricing is powerful, but luckily, there are also plenty of psychology tricks to help you spend less while shopping.\n\n[2] Of course, we still know that $9.99 is basically ten dollars, not nine dollars. But the $.99 trick takes advantage of the way our brains process prices. When we see a price of $9.99, we associate it as part of the $9–$9.99 “range” rather than the $10–$10.99 “range.” “Consumers don’t want to transcend a certain category, so even a penny less may make a huge psychological difference,” explains Subimal Chatterjee, Distinguished Teaching Professor of Marketing at Binghamton University School of Management.\n\n[3] Ending a price in .99 is based on the theory that, because we read from left to right, the first digit of the price resonates with us the most, Hibbett explained. That's why shoppers are more likely to buy a product for $4.99 than an identical one for $5 the item that starts with a 4 just seems like a better deal than the one that starts with 5.\n\"We also tend to attempt to reduce the amount of effort expended on making product decisions, especially with lower-cost items,\" Hibbett told Life's Little Mysteries. \"So we may not really process the numbers after the dollar amount.\"\nAdditionally, the .99 alone serves to make an item appear to be on sale, according to the article \"Mind Your Pricing Cues,\" published in the September 2003 issue of the Harvard Business Review.

These salty seabirds breed around Australia and New Zealand generally arriving at their breeding colonies in October, laying eggs in November, and fledging chicks by late April. Departing the oceans of these areas in the southern fall, they arrive in Japan, Alaska, and California by May and June. By mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere, millions of Sooty Shearwaters are found just offshore in one of the greatest migration spectacles in North America.

One of them is for a separate jurisdiction to file charges. Oftentimes, this means that if a defendant is found not guilty in a state court, he can then be tried by a federal court for essentially that same exact incident.\n\n[2] According to a 2020 report by the Prison Policy Initiative, 74 percent of people held by jails have not been convicted of a crime. And the reason is because, if they can’t afford bail (and we’ll get to that soon) people are detained pretrial while they wait for their cases to be resolved. Sometimes it’s because they’re a flight risk, or the person is believed to be a danger to society.

In a legal sense this means that the it is encumbent upon the prosecution to prove your guilt and not encumbent upon you to prove your innocence. The arrest is made because there is a reasonable presumption of guilt but you are only sent to jail if the court is convinced you pose a flight risk.\n\n[5] In rare cases, even if the new law violation is dropped or if you are found not guilty, the State will insist on a VOP hearing anyway.

During the formation of π bonds, the axes of the atomic orbitals are parallel to each other whereas the overlapping is perpendicular to the internuclear axis. This type of covalent bonding is illustrated below.[Image: Pi Bonds]Pi Bonds are generally weaker than sigma bonds, owing to the significantly lower degree of overlapping. Generally, double bonds consist of one sigma and one pi bond, whereas a typical triple bond is made up of two π bonds and one σ bond. It is important to note that a combination of sigma and pi bonds is always stronger than a single sigma bond.\n\n[2] In chemistry, sigma bonds (σ bonds) are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond.[1] They are formed by head-on overlapping between atomic orbitals. Sigma bonding is most simply defined for diatomic molecules using the language and tools of symmetry groups. In this formal approach, a σ-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. By this definition, common forms of sigma bonds are s+s, p_z+p_z, s+p_z and d z^2+d z^2 (where z is defined as the axis of the bond or the internuclear axis).[2] Quantum theory also indicates that molecular orbitals (MO) of identical symmetry actually mix or hybridize. As a practical consequence of this mixing of diatomic molecules, the wavefunctions s+s and p_z+p_z molecular orbitals become blended. The extent of this mixing (or hybridization or blending) depends on the relative energies of the MOs of like symmetry.\n\n[3] A sigma bond is stronger than a pi bond. The reason is that the overlapping of atomic orbitals can take place to a greater extent during the formation of a sigma bond, whereas overlapping of orbitals occurs to a smaller extent during the formation of a pi bond.\nA pi bond between two atoms is formed only in addition to a sigma bond. The reason is that the atoms constituting a single bond prefer to form a strong sigma bond rather than a weak pi bond.\nThus, a pi bond is always present in molecules with multiple bonds, i.e., double or triple bonds. In other words, a single bond cannot be a pi bond.\nThere can be free rotation of atoms around the sigma bonds. Free rotation of atoms around pi bonds is not possible because it involves breaking the pi bonds."], "label": "S", "category": "Lfqa", "additional_info": ""}

This compound occurs in varying degrees depending on the amount of charring and the length of time they were exposed to the high temperature.\nIn 2007, a study done in the Netherlands indicated the risk of cancer increased when test subjects ingested acrylamide, especially in women. Other studies with rodents have shown that exposure to acrylamide increases the chance of developing several different types of cancer.

With every power option, or “diopter”, there is a sweet spot range where close vision is brought into sharp focus. This changes from person to person. If the diopter is too weak for your individual needs, you will need to move the material farther away from your face to see it clearly. If the diopter is too strong, that range of sweet spot will be closer than you prefer. The average person reads material between 14 - 18 inches away from their face.

Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives — one exposed for the land, the other for the sky — and print them together on a single sheet of paper. The French photographer Gustave Le Gray used this technique in his majestic seascapes of the 1850s. The exhibition features three seascapes by Le Gray, all using the same cloud negative.

During the formation of π bonds, the axes of the atomic orbitals are parallel to each other whereas the overlapping is perpendicular to the internuclear axis. This type of covalent bonding is illustrated below.[Image: Pi Bonds]Pi Bonds are generally weaker than sigma bonds, owing to the significantly lower degree of overlapping. Generally, double bonds consist of one sigma and one pi bond, whereas a typical triple bond is made up of two π bonds and one σ bond. It is important to note that a combination of sigma and pi bonds is always stronger than a single sigma bond.\n\n[2] In chemistry, sigma bonds (σ bonds) are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond.[1] They are formed by head-on overlapping between atomic orbitals. Sigma bonding is most simply defined for diatomic molecules using the language and tools of symmetry groups. In this formal approach, a σ-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. By this definition, common forms of sigma bonds are s+s, p_z+p_z, s+p_z and d z^2+d z^2 (where z is defined as the axis of the bond or the internuclear axis).[2] Quantum theory also indicates that molecular orbitals (MO) of identical symmetry actually mix or hybridize. As a practical consequence of this mixing of diatomic molecules, the wavefunctions s+s and p_z+p_z molecular orbitals become blended. The extent of this mixing (or hybridization or blending) depends on the relative energies of the MOs of like symmetry.\n\n[3] A sigma bond is stronger than a pi bond. The reason is that the overlapping of atomic orbitals can take place to a greater extent during the formation of a sigma bond, whereas overlapping of orbitals occurs to a smaller extent during the formation of a pi bond.\nA pi bond between two atoms is formed only in addition to a sigma bond. The reason is that the atoms constituting a single bond prefer to form a strong sigma bond rather than a weak pi bond.\nThus, a pi bond is always present in molecules with multiple bonds, i.e., double or triple bonds. In other words, a single bond cannot be a pi bond.\nThere can be free rotation of atoms around the sigma bonds.

However, cannabis and tobacco have additional pharmacological activities, both receptor-dependent and independent, that result in different biological endpoints. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in smoke are pro-carcinogens that are converted to carcinogens by the enzymatic activity of the cytochrome P4501A1 oxidase protein (CYP1A1 gene product). Benzo [a] pyrene is converted to its carcinogenic metabolite diol epoxide, which binds to specific hyper-mutable nucleotide sequences in the K-ras oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor [22].

It’s a comparatively cheap, fast, and adaptable way of precisely snipping out pieces of the genome and swapping in new pieces, which can be used directly on the DNA in reproductive cells and produces a finished mouse in three weeks . In chickens, it nearly halves the amount of time needed, Sang says. The tools are so quick, she says with a laugh, that “I sometimes think I should have sat with my feet up for a long time and waited for them to come.”\n\n[3] CRISPR–Cas9 has revolutionized the generation of transgenic animals. This system has demonstrated an unprecedented efficiency, multiplexability, and ease of use, thereby reducing the time and cost required for genome editing and enabling the production of animals with more extensive genetic modifications. It has also been shown to be applicable to﻿ a wide variety of animals, from early-branching metazoans to primates. Genome-wide screens in model organisms have been performed, accurate models of human diseases have been constructed, and potential therapies have been tested and validated in animal models. Several achievements in genetic modification of animals have been translated into products for the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. Based on the remarkable progress to date, one may anticipate that in the future, CRISPR–Cas9 technology will enable additional far-reaching advances, including understanding the bases of diseases with complex genetic origins, engineering animals to produce organs for human transplantation, and genetically transforming entire populations of organisms to prevent the spread of disease."], "label": "S", "category": "Lfqa", "additional_info": ""}

Automatic transmission fluid is hydraulic fluid.\nWhen your vehicle’s computer decides it’s time to shift gears, it sends an electric signal to the appropriate transmission solenoid.

Drawing an accurate coastline on mid-size maps of a tropical region and small maps of temperate regions is then trivial – draw a grid of small squares, mark your starting point, draw a continuous segmented line throughout the grid, with one segment being the fixed amount of steps you walked in one fixed direction.\n\n[3] Mapping land regions from within was exceptionally accurate even in ancient times mainly because one could determine walking distances with a very high degree of accuracy. It was also often possible to create a very detailed and accurate map of more than a hundred square miles of land in a very short time just by climbing on a mountain of a decent height and looking around.\n\n[4] However, on the open sea, there are no discernible landforms one could peg his location to, and therefore determining the location of a ship on a latitude and longitude grid was always the only way to accurely estimate the distances between different continents and archipelagos."], "label": "NS", "category": "Lfqa", "additional_info": ""}

Explosions also generate proportionally smaller Surface waves than P waves. Seismologists can therefore compare the size of the different types of wave to try to determine whether the waves came from an explosion or a natural earthquake.\n\n[2] For cases like North Korea, which has carried out a sequence of nuclear tests since 2006, we can directly compare the shape of the waves recorded from each test.

In addition, any fat cooked at 250°C (482°F) or higher loses its natural properties and becomes harmful to the body. This is because burning food increases the content of carbon dioxide. After ingesting these toxins, your body must process them prior to eliminating them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you often consume burnt meals, there comes a time when your body cannot effectively process toxins, causing them to accumulate in the body, which can lead to a degeneration of cells and various gastric or liver diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, burnt food is harder for your stomach to digest, so it has to spend more time and energy processing it. This can cause an immediate feeling of having a heavy stomach, heartburn and digestive discomfort, giving rise to various gastric diseases that can become chronic illnesses.\n\n[2] Much has been said about the fact that eating burnt food causes cancer. This link has mainly been made due to the fact that cooking food at high temperatures leads to the formation of certain substances which pass through your body once ingested.

This compound occurs in varying degrees depending on the amount of charring and the length of time they were exposed to the high temperature.\nIn 2007, a study done in the Netherlands indicated the risk of cancer increased when test subjects ingested acrylamide, especially in women. Other studies with rodents have shown that exposure to acrylamide increases the chance of developing several different types of cancer. Two research organizations, the National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer both have named acrylamide a “probable human carcinogen”.

With piloting, you are determining your location using bearings from reference points on accurate maps. Here, we are using the bearing to objects to determine position of points along the coastline. Still, it works much the same way.\nMaps - especially of shorelines - were almost certainly made from observations taken from boats. Naval navigation is much more accurate than navigation on land (especially without good maps!).\n\n[2] Prior to the mid-1700's, the primary means of navigation was dead reckoning (DR). This requires that you iteratively advance your position on the map from your last known position using direction and time/distance. Of course, over time, errors will compound resulting in reduced accuracy. You must have a way of measuring your direction of travel and a (somewhat) accurate value for your speed.\nLater in the 1700's, it was possible to navigate more accurately using celestial navigation. This allowed a skilled navigator to determine his position rather accurately (typically within a few miles) at any point on the globe. The position was typically found once each day and advanced using DR as necessary.\n\n[3] The topics of navigation and cartography are two sides of the same coin, and there are entire books written about each. It is interesting to study the history of cartography because it very graphically shows the corresponding improvements in navigation over time.\nIn order to make an accurate map, you need to know first where you are making your observations from. Making the observations from a previously known position will result in much greater accuracy. This position may have been established by an earlier survey (eg, working from a known point on an existing map) or by being able to independently figure out your position with good certainty on the position of the globe.\n\n[4] The problem was the portolan mapmakers’ lack of a systematic way of reducing the spherical Earth to a flat map. That was of little consequence for short journeys but mattered much more when sailing longer distances. In 1569, the Belgian geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator created his method for presenting a spherical world on a flat map, the one familiar to us today. This mapmaking technique, though it stretched and compressed landmarks and distances between them, had the great advantage that a straight compass course was represented by a straight line on the map.\nMercator’s projections began to be used to sail the open seas by the early 1800s, by which time portolan charts had pretty much disappeared. But their importance is undeniable. “The development of these maps revolutionized how people perceived space, much like Google Earth has done in our lifetimes,” Hessler says. “Understanding how the technology was developed gives us insight into how we got here, and perhaps into where we’re going.”"], "label": "NS", "category": "Lfqa", "additional_info": ""}

So people who recall dreams may have a difference in their ability to memorize things in general.\nBeyond that, a person’s brain may actually block out a dream so we don’t remember it the following day. “The dream activity can be so real and intense that our brains actually hide, or mask away the dream, so [it doesn’t] get lost between our waking experience, and our dream lives.

These conclusions are reinforced by the recent work of Tashkin and coworkers [8] who were unable to demonstrate a cannabis smoke and lung cancer link, despite clearly demonstrating cannabis smoke-induced cellular damage.\n\n[2] Smoke from tobacco and cannabis contains many of the same carcinogens and tumor promoters [20,21]. However, cannabis and tobacco have additional pharmacological activities, both receptor-dependent and independent, that result in different biological endpoints.

Benzo [a] pyrene is converted to its carcinogenic metabolite diol epoxide, which binds to specific hyper-mutable nucleotide sequences in the K-ras oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor [22].

Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. \"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,\" Ben explains. \"If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself.\" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to \"terminate\" them. \"You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'\" Ben says. \"Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor.\" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. \"I thought it was never a concern again,\" Ben says. \"The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard.\" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. \"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,\" he says. \"It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing.\" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. \"Some days it does feel like a battle,\" Ben admits. \"The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others.\" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. \"We'd had an amazing support group,\" Ben says. \"Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. \" \"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,\" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot.\" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? \"I'm not giving up,\" she says. \"Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it.\" \"For me it's just something that you have to do,\" Ben says. \"You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option.\" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well. \"Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of,\" Shelby says, \"and lots of family and friends that care about us.\" \"She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben,\" said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. \"She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope.\" The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan. \"We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame,\" Shelby says. \"If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us,\" adds Ben. \"We just can't wait,\" Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband. \"Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting,\" Shelby says. She breaks into tears: \"Especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there's no one who doesn't.\"\n"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

The items are crafts and artifacts made by Japanese-Americans confined to World War II internment camps. A grass-roots campaign of a change.org petition, a Facebook page, and mediation by \"Star Trek\" actor George Takei has resulted in Rago Arts and Auction Center agreeing to pull the items from the sale. \"There is an essential discussion to be had about the sale of historical items that are a legacy of man's inhumanity to man. It extends beyond what is legal. It is something auction houses, galleries and dealers are faced with regularly,\" the auction house said. \"We hope this controversy will be the beginning of a discourse on this issue.\" Takei, who with his family spent time in one of the camps, thanked people for working to stop the sale. According to a comment on the Facebook page \"Japanese American History: NOT for Sale,\" he was working on the issue while on a trip to Australia. \"It took a few calls today here in the wee hours, and I'll be issuing a formal statement later, but we can all celebrate a bit today at this news,\" he wrote. The auction house said 24 lots of an original collection of works of art and crafts were removed. During World War II, about 117,000 people of Japanese descent were forced to live in 10 internment camps. The government called them relocation centers. Many of the people who lived there and their descendants had another phrase for the facilities. They call them concentration camps. Two-thirds of the people who were ordered there were native born U.S. citizens, according to the National Archives. CNN affiliate KGO reported the items were given to historian Allen Eaton, who opposed internment camps. The items were inherited from the historian's estate. Miriam Tucker, a partner with the auction house, said it had hoped the items would go to someone who cared about their historical meaning. \"For us, there could be no better resolution than for a suitable museum, foundation or members of the Japanese-American community with the means to preserve this collection to come forward and secure it for education, display and research,\" she said. KGO reported the people it talked to would like items returned to family members if possible and any other artifacts put in an exhibition. \"This was a gift and let the gift come full circle,\" said Judy Hamaguchi with the San Francisco Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League. She was referring to a letter the organization sent to the auction house. \"It should be returned as a gift.\" The lots have been packed away for now, said auction house partner David Rago in an email. \"Once the dust settles from this auction weekend (1,200 lots in three days) we will work with a small group of people from the Japanese-American community who have identified themselves through this process as generous, informed, voices of reason,\" he wrote. He said a suitable institution is the best possible home and the auction house will work with the current owner to find the right place. The seller -- known in the auction business as the consignor -- has never been in a position where the items could be donated, Rago said. \"But the consignor, who has been a sensitive and dedicated custodian of this collection for over 35 years, has agreed this evening to work with Rago Auctions to secure appropriate placement of Eaton's life work,\" he added.\n"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "It also mentions Chief Justice Roger Taney, who issued the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision and represented the dominance of the South on the Supreme Court at the time.", "reference_documents": ["As Americans mark the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's death this week, let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages, but also belongs, in a special way, to Illinois. Lincoln's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his Midwestern roots. He knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton. The entire region from the Appalachians to the Rockies drained through the Mississippi River, enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through New Orleans and from there to the world. He thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular, or Dixie more generally. The U.S. landmass, he insisted, \"is  well adapted to be the home of one national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more\" because \"there is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide.\" Lincoln supplemented his Midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly Midwestern claim about constitutional history: \"The Union is older than any of the States; and in fact, it created them as States.\" Lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case, and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the Constitution's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession. The Constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says. But Lincoln's additional assertion that the Union created the states, not vice versa, provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country. Most Virginians, including Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, insisted that of course Virginia had come first!  At the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Old Dominion was already a century and a half old. Generations of Lees had helped govern Virginia long before the United States was born. But if Lee was, first and always, a Virginian, Lincoln was an American. His father came from Virginia, his grandfather hailed from Pennsylvania, and before that, the family had probably lived in New England. Abe himself had been born in Kentucky and had moved as a boy to Indiana, and later, as a young man, to Illinois. These latter two Midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the Union itself. These places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all Americans -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life. When young Abe moved to Indiana, it was just becoming a state, thanks to federal governmental action. It was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the Lincolns and countless other Kentuckians to leave the Bluegrass State for a brighter future in the Midwest. Retracing Lincoln's assassination 150 years later. That brighter future also involved freedom from slavery. The Old Northwest had always been free soil, as provided for by a Northwest Ordinance that predated the U.S. Constitution.  The words of the 13th  Amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that Lincoln would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in America and did so by borrowing verbatim from Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance. True, geography is not inexorable destiny. Many other Midwesterners in Lincoln's era embraced slavery and secession. Hugo Black, the Supreme Court justice who did the most to make Lincoln's constitutional vision a reality over the next century, was born and raised in Alabama. But geographic variation has always been a large part of America's constitutional saga. In the 1860 election that brought him to power, Lincoln swept almost all the Northern states, but did miserably in the slaveholding south. John Wilkes Booth, the dastard who ended Lincoln's life 150 years ago this week, was an embittered extremist from a slave state. So was Lincoln's nemesis on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger Taney. Taney's most infamous ruling, the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision in 1857, had emerged from a court dominated by the South; although slave states accounted for less a third of America's free population, this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court. Remembering Lincoln's murder. In our era, given the fact that Republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years, the court has been rather moderate. Much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern Republicans on the Court -- most notably, Minnesota's Harry Blackmun, Illinois' John Paul Stevens, and New Hampshire's David Souter. All nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal New England, at Harvard or Yale, and the Republican appointee most attentive to gay rights, Anthony Kennedy, grew up in northern California, a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles. Which takes us back to Lincoln. When Anthony Kennedy was a lad in California's state capital, the governor, a friend of the Kennedy family, was a Lincoln Republican named Earl Warren -- a man who would later author the Court's iconic opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by Lincoln and his allies. Today, both parties at their best claim Lincoln. Jeb Bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and Rand Paul is a Kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach. Hillary Clinton was born an Illinois Republican.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The case stems from a nonprosecution agreement reached between Epstein and federal authorities, which some of his alleged victims claim violates their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act.", "reference_documents": ["A Florida judge denied a motion by two women to join a lawsuit against Prince Andrew and a prominent U.S. lawyer that alleged  underage sex crimes. Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- \"Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the \"lurid details\" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. \"The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: \"I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them.\" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. \"He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,\" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that \"Doe 3\" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a \"sex slave\" and made \"her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people.\" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, \"Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case \"is all about money\" and \"completely made up.\" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said \"lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably.\" \"Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,\" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. \"Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,\" he stated, \"that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Steve Almasy, Javier de Diego, Josh Levs contributed to this report.\n"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

Stancil is accused of killing an employee Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Relatives have said victim Ron Lane was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported, and investigators are looking into whether the shooting was a hate crime. Authorities arrested Stancil after he was found sleeping on a Florida beach on Tuesday. Just a few minutes into Thursday's hearing on the first-degree murder charge he faces, Stancil snapped back at the judge after he was offered a court-appointed lawyer. \"No, I don't need one,\" said Stancil, who stood before the judge with his legs shackled and his arms handcuffed in front of him. \"You know what I'm saying? I knew I would get life anyway.\" Superior Court Judge Arnold O. Jones interjected, pointing out that the maximum sentence Stancil faces is the death penalty. \"Yes, I know that,\" Stancil fired back. \"But when I knew what I had to do and I knew when I got caught, you know, I knew in my mind that I could get life, I could get the death penalty. You know what I'm saying? Do you follow my topic?

Deputies quickly corralled him and hustled him from the courtroom. The hearing resumed about 25 minutes later, when Stancil was brought back into the courtroom, this time with his arms handcuffed behind him. When asked again by Jones whether he wanted a lawyer, his response was quick -- and calm. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WRAL, Stancil described himself as a neo-Nazi and said he hates gay people \"with a passion.\" Stancil had worked for Lane, the school's print shop operator, as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March because of poor attendance, college officials said. During the interview, and during a court appearance in Florida on Tuesday, Stancil said Lane deserved to die, accusing him of being a child molester who'd made advances in online messages to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Lane's family has described those accusations as untrue and slanderous. His cousin, Steve Smith, told WRAL that Lane never made sexual advances toward children or anyone with whom he worked. He described him as a loving man who was dedicated to family and friends. \"Yes, Ron was gay.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "One topic is the criticism from former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley towards Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.", "reference_documents": ["Washington (CNN)Early Clinton campaign calculations, the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns, a GOP ticket for the generations, and Republican calendar concerns filled our Sunday trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. 1. Watch the volume as O'Malley uses YouTube to test Clinton pokes. Slowly but clearly, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. How aggressive will he get? Stay tuned -- literally. CNN's Jeff Zeleny says O'Malley enjoys using YouTube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by Clinton, like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver's licenses. \"Every time Hillary Clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from '08 to '16 -- her statement on the drivers' licenses that we discussed and other things -- Martin O'Malley has been releasing a YouTube video showing a speech where he has done something different, so watch for that to continue,\" said Zeleny. \"Those YouTube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race --the liberals love them.\" 2. The \"Obama Factor\": Clinton finds a lot to love, and some distance. Hillary Clinton is a big fan of President Obama's health care law, but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style. So reports AP's Lisa Lerer, who was in Iowa this past week for the Clinton campaign rollout, and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime Obama 2008 rival who, of course, went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state. \"She embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law, for his push for immigration legislation -- but it wasn't all sunshine and light,\" said Lerer. \"She also took subtle digs at his leadership style— she said America was on the wrong track-- I can't believe I'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a Republican.\" 3. In big policy choice, Clinton signals an important campaign focus. In Democratic politics, Kamala is the Harris sister who gets the most national buzz. But Maya Harris is about to play a big role in the question of how Hillary Clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes. Kamala Harris is the California attorney general and a 2016 Senate candidate, for the seat being vacated by Democrat Barbara Boxer. Maya Harris just signed on for a top policy role in the Clinton campaign -- and CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message. \"One clue, I think, is Maya Harris,\" said Henderson. \"Her resume is really a liberal's dream.  She has worked at the Center for American Progress, ACLU, she's also done work on community policing and police reforming, and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate.\" \"So I think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that Hillary Clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color, who are so crucial to getting the Obama coalition back together again.\" 4. Walker-Rubio? Rubio-Walker? A general contrast with some GOP buzz. Marco Rubio drew a direct generational contrast with Hillary Clinton when he officially joined the GOP 2106 race, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also often talks of his hope Republicans will look for a next-generation leader as their next presidential nominee. In political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a Walker-Rubio pairing is not limited to inside the Beltway chatter. \"They both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that Clinton and Gore did ... in 1992,\" said Martin. \"But what's interesting is, in New Hampshire over the weekend, I was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates, for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- I heard somebody float the idea of a Walker-Rubio race in 2016.\" 5. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and then? Heading into the 2016 cycle, the Republican National Committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process, including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front-loaded. Now, some big GOP establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar. Florida is usually the next big contest, but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the \"SEC primary.\" It is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress. But what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a Super Tuesday -- or maybe back-to-back Tuesdays -- in early March that include a number of conservative Southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, maybe Louisiana. The shift is one reason former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008. Ditto for Rick Santorum. They did well in the South, but it didn't matter much because John McCain and Mitt Romney, respectively, were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted. Again, there might yet be more changes. But more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites -- people like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio -- and helping those with strong evangelical connections -- like Huckabee and Cruz.\n"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The shooting occurred in the Nusoor Square traffic circle and was found by an FBI investigation to have resulted in 14 unjustified deaths.", "reference_documents": ["Washington (CNN)One former employee of the private Blackwater Worldwide security company was sentenced Monday to life in prison and three others to 30 years each behind bars for their roles in a 2007 mass shooting in Baghdad that left 17 people dead. A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed \"powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children.\" Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007. Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. \"It was horror,\" said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. \"People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone.\" Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors. The parents and brothers of the 9-year-old victim were present in court during the sentencing hearing and spoke. Ali Razzaq's father looked at the defendants and yelled in broken English: \"If I kill anyone in his family, what he do?! Today, we will see who will win, the law or Blackwater,\" he said. \"Blackwater killed my son.\" Dad in 2007: Blackwater blew up son's and wife's 'skulls' The defense presented character witnesses, family members and former colleagues who testified to the defendants' capacity to work under fire and willingness to help others. Each defendant also gave a closing statement. Slatten addressed the court last, taking the opportunity to declare his innocence. Lamberth rejected his argument. The judge said that the punishments reflected the seriousness of the crimes. He said that the U.S. government \"should be commended for finding and exposing the truth of what happened.\" Blackwater incident witness in 2007: 'It was hell' A few gasps were heard in the courtroom, and some crying. The case was initially dismissed in 2008 after a judge found the Justice Department withheld key evidence and violated the rights of the contractors. A federal appeals court reversed the ruling, paving the way for the two-month trial that ended in convictions for the four. Another contractor, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter and testified for the government. He has not yet been sentenced. Blackwater lost its $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company's operating license. The company was later renamed and sold, and now operates as ACADEMI, providing protection services and training. 2007 congressional report: Blackwater most often shoots first.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The majority opinion dismisses constitutional issues and maintains the status quo, while a dissenting opinion argues that trademarks are protected commercial speech and the government should not withhold benefits based on the content of the recipient's speech.", "reference_documents": ["Given that most people couldn't tell the difference between a copyright and a trademark, it usually takes something controversial, such as the Washington Redskins' refusal to change their name, to get people interested in trademark law. This week, a higher court scrutinized a lesser-known trademark -- when the band The Slants sought to protect its name. The Slants are five Asian-American musicians from Portland, Oregon, who pay homage to the '80s on stage -- and homage to their heritage in an ironic way. \"We want to take on stereotypes that people have about us, like the slanted eyes, and own them,\" Simon Shiao Tam, the band's front-man, said.  In other words, the group adopted the Lenny Bruce philosophy of repeating an insulting term until it doesn't mean anything anymore.  To The Slants, \"slant\" isn't an insult, it is empowering. And more power to them. Unfortunately, a bureaucrat at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office decided that \"Slant\" was disparaging to Asians, and denied them a trademark registration under the despised (by me, anyhow) Section 2(a) of the trademark act.  This is the section that lets the government deny trademark protection to a mark that is \"immoral,\" \"scandalous\" or \"disparaging.\"  In this case, the latter. But wait a minute.  This isn't billionaire Dan Snyder referring to other people as \"Redskins.\"  In L'affair Redskins, it is the disparaged group, Native Americans, who are complaining -- not the government deciding on its own that it knows best.  In the Slants' case, these are Asian guys who say \"it doesn't bother us, so why should it bother you?\"  And it isn't as if any Asian American groups got involved. This is not the first time that someone has \"taken back\" a marginalizing term in a trademark fight. About 10 years ago, the motorcycle club \"Dykes on Bikes\" was similarly rebuffed, and they fought back and won the right to protect their mark. They made similar arguments that resonated: If they wanted to call themselves \"Dykes on Bikes,\" then what place does the government have in judging that decision? In another decision, the trademark office initially denied a registration for Buddha Beachwear on the grounds that Buddhists would find it disparaging. But on reconsideration, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board held that it should go forward stating it is \"imperative that the board be careful to avoid interposing its own judgment for that of Buddhists.\" So why aren't the Slants given the same privileges as Dykes on Bikes or Buddha Beachwear?  It is largely a sign of the times.  We find ourselves mired deeper and deeper in a society where people actually get excited to take offense at virtually anything.  Given the lingering controversy over the Redskins' trademark, our five friends from Oregon didn't stand a chance. This decision offends me. For starters, by trying to protect Asians from racism, the court issued a disturbingly racist decision based on the fact that these were, in fact, Asians who intended their band name to invoke their ethnicity.  But, if a Sicilian (like me) were to seek to register the same exact name, with no such intent, I would enjoy that privilege. This isn't quite Korematsu v. United States (the decision that authorized putting Asians in internment camps), but the decision is quite unprincipled. Even worse, this decision gets the First Amendment wrong.  The majority opinion almost flippantly discards the Constitutional issues as much ado about nothing.  Essentially it says, \"we did it this way before, so we are going to keep doing it this way.\" Your Constitution got stepped on before, and who are we to take our feet off of it? If you're not upset by now, you should be. Well, the court does give us a sort-of dissent styled as \"additional views.\"  While not binding, some of our most cherished First Amendment rights grew from the tiny seeds planted by the dissents of Oliver Wendell Holmes.  The dissent in this case recognizes the fact that trademarks are commercial speech, which is protected by the First Amendment. It also notes that the government should not be in the business of giving out or withholding benefits on the basis of the content of the recipient's speech.  This is known as the doctrine of \"unconstitutional conditions.\" Since Section 2(a) discriminates against First Amendment protected expression on the basis of its content, the court has called for 2(a) to be, finally, deemed unconstitutional. But, for some reason, it declined to actually go that far.  It merely suggested it, without so ruling.  And people wonder why my hair is falling out. I guess I will start a protest band and call them \"The Guinea Pigs.\"  But, I won't be allowed to register that trademark -- although the five Asian guys from The Slants could.  Maybe we should just each register the other band's marks, and trade them after we get past the bureaucrats at the trademark office.\n"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

They’re competing for who gets the biggest executive compensation package.”\nAccording to Michigan Advance, the big three CEOs all made over $20 million. “General Motors CEO Mary Barra’s compensation is $29 million, the highest of the big three automakers, followed by Stellantis’ Carlo Tevares at $25 million and Ford’s Jim Farley at $21 million.”\nFain has been bringing up the executive officers’ salaries because they have risen by 40% since 2019 when the last contract was done. However, the auto workers' wages have only risen 6% during the same period.\nCindy Schipani, a business law professor at the University of Michigan explained how this hurts the companies during negotiations. “The union seems to be arguing an equity issue, especially in light of the sacrifices the workers needed to make in past negotiations,” she said. “Of course, the CEO’s job isn’t comparable to the job of the average worker, but I suspect the UAW may believe it has some leverage. If the company can afford to raise the salary of the top executive at roughly 40% over 4 years, why not also grant the rank and file similar increases.”"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The black and white bully breed mix, named Theia, was found emaciated and covered in dirt four days after she was buried.", "reference_documents": ["Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, \"She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home.\" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to \"make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!\" Any additional funds raised will be \"paid forward\" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.\n"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The Saudi airstrikes have been part of a campaign to combat the Houthi rebels, who have taken control of the capital, Sanaa.", "reference_documents": ["Yemeni officials said Saudi airstrikes targeting a military base on Tuesday hit a nearby school, injuring at least a half dozen students. The information came from two officials with the governor's office in Ibb province, where the school is located, as well as Houthi sources from the rebel group that is fighting for control of the country. A third source, with the Education Ministry in Ibb, said three students had been killed at the Al Bastain School in Maitam, in southwestern Yemen, as a result of an airstrike. The officials from Ibb's governor's office said the Al Hamza military base was targeted because Houthis have been sending reinforcements from Ibb to nearby provinces. There were no casualties on the base, the officials said, but it was heavily damaged. The school, which is about 500 meters (one-third of a mile) from the base, was not the main target, the officials said. Schoolchildren were heading to their lunch break when the attacks took place, the officials said. The incident was another example of what has become evident in recent days: The chaos in Yemen, now the scene of some of the most chaotic fighting in the Middle East, has left civilians -- noncombatants, both locals and foreigners -- caught in the crossfire. Those trying to escape the violence, either by leaving their homes or by leaving the country altogether, have been flung into a vortex of fear, fatigue, flight and death. Explosions shattered windows in Sanaa, the country's capital. The fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks. At least 74 children are known to have been killed and 44 children maimed since the fighting began on March 26, UNICEF said Monday in a statement. That did not include the children reportedly killed Tuesday in Maitam. Separately, Saudi airstrikes wiped out about a fifth of the armored vehicles recently captured by southern separatists opposing the Houthis near Aden, according to a senior official in the separatist movement. The official expressed frustration about the lack of coordination between the Saudi military and friendly forces in the region, including the anti-Houthi southern separatists. (The Houthis are also sometimes referred to as southern separatists). \"The Saudis have no one on the ground in Aden,\" he said, calling for the military to work out a means of coordination. \"There is very little coordination.\" The group had recently captured about 100 pieces of mixed armor. Among the captured weaponry, the official said, were tanks, armored personnel carriers, and some large artillery.  About 20 pieces were destroyed in the Saudi attack that took place near an old oil refinery. Over the weekend, a Saudi-led coalition smashed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital, senior Yemeni officials said. Despite the rain of bombs, the Houthis still control Sanaa. But the airstrikes have destroyed much of the city's infrastructure. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. Yemenis and foreigners are scrambling to leave. Passengers carrying duffel bags and plastic sacks stuffed with clothes were seen boarding an Air India flight as they hastened to leave the capital. Some of them sprinted to the plane. This was a flight that no one wanted to miss. Many were not newcomers to Yemen. Damodar Thakur, a professor at Sanaa University, had lived in the capital for 34 years. \"I never felt like a foreigner,\" he said. He was exhausted by the shelling. \"At night, my goodness!\" he said. \"Gunshots being fired every minute. Sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights. Some women crying, children terrified. Really bad.\" Over the last few days, India has evacuated 2,500 people from Yemen, said Vijay Kumar Singh, the Indian deputy foreign minister overseeing the evacuation. The flights are going to Djibouti, a small African nation about 430 kilometers (265 miles) away. Some evacuees are fleeing on boats from port cities such as Aden. \"More cars in the streets in #Aden. Scared families rushing away in cars with smashed windows & suitcases & mattresses on the roof,\" tweeted Robert Mardini, head of operations for the Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? Houthi rebels control Sanaa, including the airport. But because of the airstrike campaign, the Saudis to some extent control air access, so getting people out requires coordination. The Saudi air force gave Air India a four-hour window to go to and from Sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing. As the Air India plane approached the city, the crew could see the scars of the fighting. There were no cars on the roads. Dozens of buildings were destroyed. At the airport, the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by Saudi bombs, but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits. Loading of the passengers was swift. They approached the planes carrying boarding passes -- a touch of normalcy in an otherwise abnormal event. They didn't pay for the flight, but they had to purchase exit visas from the Houthis. Children sat on their parents' laps to maximize the number of people on the plane. Some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff. Everyone seemed to carry the weight of war, especially nurses who had tended the wounded. From Djibouti, the evacuees will most likely disperse to their home nations. \"Now I can only pray for Yemen and those we left behind,\" Thakur said. Who's joining Saudi Arabia's fight against the Houthis? Yemen has descended into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels, Shiites who complain of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country, forced President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overran Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself still President. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominantly Sunni nation and Yemen's neighbor to the north, to intervene with force along with other Arab nations. The Houthis are allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf, and the Saudis do not want an Iranian proxy in power on their border. At his daily briefing on Tuesday, Saudi Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri told reporters that the ties between the rebels and Iran were clear. He accused Iran of training Yemeni youths to use military aircraft and weapons. After the Houthis seized Sanaa, he said, \"there were 14 flights a week coming from Iran carrying weapons and ammunition for the Houthi militia.\" The U.S. role in backing the Saudis has grown since the bombing campaign began two weeks ago. \"We have expedited weapons deliveries, we have increased our intelligence sharing, and we have established a joint coordination planning cell in the Saudi operation center,\" Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said. In addition, the United States has promised to resupply the Saudi weapons stocks used in the last two weeks. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter \"emphasized the importance of limiting civilian casualties when conducting airstrikes\" when he spoke with Saudi Defense Minister Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, the Pentagon said. What about sharing intelligence when it comes to identifying targets? That's a sensitive issue, given the rebels' ties to Iran and concerns about civilian casualties. Guidance from U.S. Central Command stops short of allowing the United States to tell the Saudis what targets to bomb, according to two U.S. defense officials who confirmed details of the guidance to CNN, but declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The guidance allows the United States to review targets the Saudis have selected, the officials said, and advise them if there are civilian areas nearby or other \"no go\" spots such as mosques and hospitals. CNN's Samira Said, Joe Sheffer and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.\n"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

A first half goal from Welsh international Aaron Ramsey was enough to separate the two sides and secure Arsenal's hold on second place. More importantly it took the north London club to within four points of first placed Chelsea, with the two clubs to play next week. But Chelsea have two games in hand and play lowly Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, a team who are themselves struggling against relegation. Good form. Arsenal have been in superb form since the start of the year, transforming what looked to be another mediocre season struggling to secure fourth place -- and with it Champions League qualification -- into one where they at least have a shot at winning the title. After going ahead, Arsenal rarely looked in any danger of conceding, showing more of the midfield pragmatism epitomized by the likes of Francis Coquelin, who also played a crucial role in the goal. \"He has been absolutely consistent in the quality of his defensive work,\" Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports after the game when asked about Coquelin's contribution to Arsenal's current run. They have won eight games in a  row since introducing the previously overlooked young Frenchman into a more defensive midfield position. \"He was a player who was with us for seven years, from 17, he's now just 24,\" Wenger explained. \"Sometimes you have to be patient. I am very happy for him because he has shown great mental strength.\" Now all eyes will be on next week's clash between Arsenal and Chelsea which will likely decide the title. \"They have the games in hand,\" said Wenger, playing down his club's title aspirations. \"But we'll keep going and that's why the win was so important for us today.\" Relegation dogfight.

Belgian international Christian Benteke scored the only goal of the game, his eighth in six matches, to secure a vital three points to give the Midlands club breathing space. Another Midlands club looking over their shoulder is West Brom, who conceded an injury time goal to lose 3-2 against bottom club Leicester City. But it was an awful day for Sunderland's former Dutch international coach Dick Advocaat, who saw his team lose 4-1 at home against form team Crystal Palace.

Though Indonesian officials said all 10 would be executed at the same time, Spontana said French national Serge Atlaoui had filed a challenge to the State Administrative Court on Thursday so his sentence has been delayed. Meanwhile, Edre Olalia, a lawyer acting for Philippines maid Mary Jane Veloso, told CNN Sunday that Veloso had telephoned her sister on Saturday at about 5:30 p.m. local time and said her execution will take place on Tuesday, April 28.  Officials at the Philippines Embassy in Jakarta confirmed the same information. According to her lawyers, Veloso unknowingly carried drugs into Indonesia, and that she was set up by members of a drug syndicate. On Friday, Indonesian officials advised relevant consular officials to travel to Indonesia's \"execution island\" -- Nusa Kambangan -- where the ten are being held -- a sign that the sentences may be carried out soon. They will face a firing squad. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war. The ten on death row, which also include two Australian citizens Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran -- members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" smuggling ring -- as well as prisoners from Ghana, Brazil, Nigeria and Indonesia, had their petitions for clemency denied by President Joko Widodo in late 2014. A statement Sunday from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Australian government had been notified that the execution of Chan and Sukumaran would be carried out \"imminently.\" \"I spoke to Mr. Sukumaran's mother Raji yesterday and assured her the government would continue to seek clemency from Indonesian President Widodo for both men. \"They have been rehabilitated in a most remarkable way over the past ten years and are genuinely remorseful for their serious crimes. \"Nothing can be gained and much will be lost if these two young Australians are executed. \"I again respectfully call on the President of Indonesia to reconsider his refusal to grant clemency. It is not too late for a change of heart.\" The two Australians, convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot, tried to challenge the President's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the State Administrative Court to hear their case. Their lawyers have since filed another review at the Constitutional Court. The Attorney General's office has said they would respect all ongoing court proceedings but insisted the inmates have exhausted all their legal options. Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with Indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths. On Saturday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Indonesia's government to reverse their decision. \"The Secretary-General appeals to the government of Indonesia to refrain from carrying out the execution, as announced, of 10 prisoners on death row for alleged drug-related crimes,\" a spokesman for Ban said, according to various reports. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch says President Widodo \"has an important opportunity to signal Indonesia's rejection of the death penalty by sparing the lives of the 10 people facing looming execution.\" \"Widodo can demonstrate true leadership by ending capital punishment as unacceptable state brutality,\" said Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement Saturday. \"President Widodo should recognize that the death penalty is not a crime deterrent but an unjustifiable and barbaric punishment. Widodo should promote Indonesia as a rights-respecting democracy by joining the countries that have abolished capital punishment.\"\n"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.  Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared \"I do\" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other. In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her \"first and only\" marriage. Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of \"offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,\" referring to her false statements on the 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents. Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam. On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further. After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.  All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say. Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.  Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted. The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney's Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called \"red-flagged\" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali. Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.\n"], "label": "S", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

As the president and CEO of CBS Corp., which includes Showtime, Moonves runs a powerful television network in a town where nearly every waiter also wants to be an actor. But when he walked into Craig's in West Hollywood last year, those roles were reversed. This time, Moonves' waiter, Gabriel Salvador, was the one serving up a mouthwatering opportunity that had nothing to do with the shrimp diavolo. Instead, he was offering Moonves an \"in\" to the most coveted match-up in boxing: Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao. \"Moonves' love of boxing, our love of boxing -- that gave me the confidence to say to him 'Give me a chance,'\" said Salvador, an actor who has appeared in \"Bones\" and \"Blue Bloods.\" \"I said 'I can help you make this fight happen,' and he looked at me like, 'Okay, I'm listening.'\" That's when Salvador told Moonves his son trained at the Hollywood gym owned by Freddie Roach, Pacquiao's trainer, and that he would put in a good word for Moonves. At that point, Salvador told CNN, he was driven more by his passion to see the fight happen than any real connection to Roach. But he got Roach's phone number from his son, Elijah, who was skeptical of his father's plan. Everybody had already tried, his son said. But Salvador made the call and gained an audience in Roach. \"I said, 'Listen, I can help you make this fight happen,'\" Salvador said in an interview with CNN. Salvador helped set up a meeting between Moonves, Roach and himself at Scarpetta in Beverly Hills that he says began with a discussion about the legacy of boxing. \"Mr. Moonves said to me, 'If this fight happens, you're going to be sitting there,'\" said Salvador. Salvador's role ended after that dinner. What followed was a series of meetings between Moonves and both sides that eventually ended the stalemate keeping Pacquiao and Mayweather from entering the same ring. The May 2 fight -- on the pay-per-view services of Showtime and HBO -- is expected to gross as much as $600 million. With that kind of money, and a smattering of media buzz around Salvador's story, inevitable questions circulated over what, if any, reward he should get, given the epic nature of the fight. When asked to comment, Pacquiao's team downplayed Salvador's role. \"For him giving Les my phone number I don't think he deserves a finder's fee,\" Roach told CNN. Promoter Bob Arum said Salvador \"got his 10 minutes of fame,\" though he called Salvador \"a really nice guy.\" Salvador insists he is not seeking money, and a CBS spokesman confirmed his role in the initial meeting. \"My reward will be sitting at the fight,\" Salvador said. Moonves made good on that promise -- Salvador will be ringside on Saturday night. \"It's about taking a chance,\" Salvador said. \"It's about putting people in touch with each other and being able to sit back and say, 'Wow, I planted that seed.'\"\n"], "label": "NS", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: \"It was a joke, and no offense was meant.\" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: \"We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real.\" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised \"money back if he walks\" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius.

A smuggler in the Libyan capital of Tripoli laid bare the system for loading boats with poor and desperate refugees, during a conversation that a CNN producer secretly filmed. The conversation, recorded using a mobile phone, exposes the prices and incentives used to gather as many migrants as possible onto ships. An estimated 1,600 migrants have died so far this year on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing, but still more wait to try to reach Europe. CNN's producer was introduced to a Senegalese and Malian smuggler by an intermediary in Tripoli, who mistakenly thought she was a Syrian looking to bring other Syrian refugees with her onto boats to Italy. Why I fled: Migrants share their stories. The smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of Tripoli near the city's many ports, where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready. The building could only be reached by walking down a trash-littered alleyway, and featured a series of packed rooms, separated by curtains, where dozens sat -- well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat. The smuggler explained that the \"final price\" for Syrians -- often thought to be richer than their African migrant counterparts -- was $1,000. He added that for each Syrian she brought with her, the producer would get a $100 discount. So if she brought 10, she could travel free. He explained how the \"discount\" was \"well known,\" suggesting perhaps it was part of the unwritten rules that govern the trade and why so many migrants come to each boat. Any fears about the crossing were supposed to be allayed by the smuggler insisting the boats they used had new motors, and that the Senegalese pilot would have a satellite telephone and GPS to assist the crossing. He also assured CNN's producer, when asked, that if the people became too many, they would use two boats.

What was supposed to be an overnight pit stop in the southwestern city of Chongqing has now stretched into a two-and-a-half week stay. It's an unexpected layover that is testing the patience of the pilots and more than 60 team members, just a quarter of the way along a journey that will cover some 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles) over five months. \"You can believe that your will can influence the weather,\" says pilot Bertrand Piccard, who comes from a long family line of explorers.  But \"then you'll be really disappointed because it doesn't work. \"Or you just know that it's an adventure you do with the forces of nature.\" Piccard, along with Andre Borschberg, a Swiss engineer, are taking turns flying the single-seater aircraft, which took off from Abu Dhabi on March 9 and has successfully flown through Oman, India, and Myanmar. There is much at stake. Their mission, which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy, and inspiring innovation, has been 12 years in the making. In many ways, it has become Piccard and Borschberg's raison d'etre. But so far, the Solar Impulse 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground. The latest setback came when a Thursday takeoff was canceled, because the cross winds in Nanjing, the plane's destination, were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time. Because of its weight, at just 2,300 kilograms -- about the same as a large SUV -- the aircraft needs near perfect weather conditions, including cross winds of less than 4 knots, or about 7 kilometers an hour, in order to fly. While the team is used to waiting, they are clearly eager to move on. \"Our boss is the sun,\" says Solar Impulse spokeswoman Claudia Durgnat. Durgnat says there may be a tiny window ahead, with the next possible departure from Chongqing on Tuesday. \"It's not good before, and the days after don't look very clear.\" Even with the delay, Durgnat says, the plane technically isn't behind schedule. That's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer, before the plane can venture across the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. With more than 17,000 solar cells along the tops of its wings and fuselage, the Solar Impulse 2 stores up energy during the day, in order to power the motors that carry it through the night, typically at speeds no faster than a car on a highway. Inside a specially constructed tent at the end of the runway at Chongqing International Airport, a skeleton team of less than a dozen people works to complete the day's tasks. The rest of the crew has been waiting for weeks in Nanjing. Even with the extended stay, no time is wasted. Piccard spends a few hours of the afternoon in the cockpit, training to prepare for the Solar Impulse's crossings over the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, what the team calls \"the moment of truth.\" The plane will then return to Abu Dhabi, where it had taken off. Nearby, two technicians repair a couple of the flight computers, which display critical information in the cockpit, punching extra holes in their casings so they don't overheat. Meanwhile, Borschberg has returned to Switzerland to rest and get medical treatment for a migraine and a skin condition. The team expects him back in China early next week. Borschberg is still scheduled to fly first leg of the Pacific crossing, which could last up to five days and nights. \"The airplane is ready. The mission control center is ready. We've been waiting for that moment since so long,\" says Piccard. Borschberg and Piccard, who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the U.S. in 2013, are no strangers to adventure. Borschberg is a former fighter pilot, and Piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999.\n"], "label": "NS", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

Brady, 73, died of pneumonia, the family said. \"Sarah courageously stepped up after Jim was shot to prevent others from enduring what our family has gone through, and her work has saved countless lives,\" their statement said. James Brady, President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, was shot in the head by John Hinckley Jr. during his attempt to assassinate Reagan in 1981. Brady spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair, advocating against gun violence. He died in August. Sarah Brady was also involved in gun violence prevention for the past 30 years. She was the chairwoman of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence from 2000 until she died. The National Rifle Association said its thoughts and prayers were with the Brady family. \"Although we disagreed on public policy, Sarah Brady was an honorable American who we always respected,\" the gun rights organization said. People we've lost in 2015. On the Brady Campaign's website, she said she got involved in gun control after her young son picked up what she thought was a toy gun on the seat of a friend's pickup. Her son started to wave it around and she took it from him. It was not a toy, she said, and she fumed over what she imagined could have happened. The loaded gun was much like the one used to shoot her husband. \"It just hit me like a ton of bricks,\" she told CNN in 2013. \"So I asked Jim if he felt comfortable with me speaking out, and he said, 'Of course.'\" After that, the Bradys made it their business to be gun control activists. Despite budgets that were just a fraction of the gun lobby's, the Bradys and their colleagues helped pass federal and state laws, including Maryland's 1988 ban on cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials, 1993's Brady law requiring background checks on certain kinds of gun purchases and a ban on manufacturing and future sales of some military-style firearms, which lasted from 1994 to 2004. Read Sarah Brady's 2014 op-ed for CNN.com. Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the Brady bill in 1993, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement Saturday that the Bradys \"were fierce champions of sensible gun legislation.\" Sarah Brady \"transformed tragedy into a courageous campaign, and because of her work and her remarkable life, American families are safer today,\" the Clintons said. Brady Campaign and Center President Dan Gross said in a written statement that few people are responsible for saving as many lives as Sarah and James Brady. \"Our nation has lost a great hero, and I have lost a dear friend,\" he said. \"I am certain that she would want nothing more than to know we are carrying on her and Jim's legacy with the same fiery compassion and dedication that made her so remarkable.\" Sen Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who helped write the Brady bill, concurred. \"She was strong and forceful, sweet and kind, and someone I considered a friend and patriot for decades,\" he said. \"She was a true hero and will be missed by America.\" James Brady was one of four people wounded in Reagan's shooting outside a Washington hotel. Suffering a head wound, it was erroneously reported at one point that Brady had died. He was, however, left partially paralyzed. Reagan, severely wounded as well, also survived the attack and served two terms as President.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Authorities in South Carolina have released dash cam footage of the fatal shooting of Walter Scott by North Charleston police officer Michael Slager.", "reference_documents": ["Authorities in South Carolina have released dash cam video in connection with the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, but the footage does not show the actual shooting. Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott. Slager approaches Scott's vehicle. The two men speak. Scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle. Slager then returns to his patrol car. Scott exits his vehicle, briefly, and Slager tells him to stay in the car. Scott then gets out of the car, again, and runs away, out of the range of the dash cam. The video, which was released Thursday, also shows a passenger in Scott's car. The passenger's identity was not given in a police report obtained by CNN, but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. He did not identify the friend by name. When asked what might have motivated Scott to run, Justin Bamberg, another attorney for the family, speculated that Scott might have been concerned about child support issues. Scott owed back payments on child support totaling $18,104.43, according to Charleston County family court documents obtained by CNN. He had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by Slager. But Bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened. \"This dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed Mr. Scott -- that shooting was completely unjustified. And that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit,\" the lawyer said. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing more information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing that's being conducted by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight. In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" the officer writes that Slager said. \"He took my Taser.\" But a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw Scott try to get Slager's Taser. Feidin Santana was walking to work when he saw Slager and Scott struggle on the ground, he told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday. Santana then took out his phone and started recording video. \"I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott,\" Santana said. Then, Santana said, he heard the sound of a Taser. It seemed to Santana that Scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the Tasered again. On Thursday, a second witness spoke to CNN about what she saw. Gwen Nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and, curious, she followed them. She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" said Nichols, who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' \" she said. Feidin showed the video to the Scott family. But Santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape. In interviews with MSNBC and NBC, Santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video. \"I ... thought about erasing the video,\" Santana told MSNBC's \"All in With Chris Hayes\" in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. \"I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger.\" The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear. An autopsy showed that Scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body. Before the officer starts firing his gun in the video, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's also not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager has been fired and charged with murder. He is white. Scott, who was unarmed, was black. Timeline of events. Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. Asked how he felt about Slager being charged with murder, Santana answered that \"no one can feel happy.\" \"He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family,\" he told Holt. \"But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. ... Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that.\" Lessons learned from Ferguson to North Charleston. The FBI is investigating, as is SLED. \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,\" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. Mayor Keith Summey spoke at the same news conference, which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted: \"No justice! No peace!\" They called for the mayor to step down. Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a \"Black Lives Matter\" T-shirt who shouted, \"This is what democracy looks like!\" 2010 census data show that North Charleston is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's Police Department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of 10 City Council members are black. It's unclear what Slager's motivation was, or if race played a part in Scott's slaying. \"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,\" Scott family attorney Stewart said. \"I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature.\" If convicted, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? An autopsy of Scott showed that he \"sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,\" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager's account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,\" Scott said. Family members have adamantly repeated that they don't want protests over Scott's slaying to become violent. And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she feels \"forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son.\" \"He was a loving son, a loving father,\" she said. \"He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son.\" Who was Walter Scott? CNN's Tony Marco, Ryan Scallan, Christine Bear, Tristan Smith, Martin Savidge, Brian Todd, Dana Ford, Sam Stringer and Evan Perez contributed to this report.\n"], "label": "NS", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "A police reserve deputy, Robert Bates, shot and killed an escaped suspect in Tulsa, Oklahoma while he believed he was using a stun gun.", "reference_documents": ["Robert Bates says he gets it, how you might wonder how a cop could confuse a pistol for a stun gun. Bates -- the Tulsa County, Oklahoma, reserve sheriff's deputy accused of manslaughter in the death of a fleeing suspect -- told NBC's \"Today\" show Friday that he used to think that, too. \"Believe me,\" he told the show in his first appearance since being charged in the April 2 death of Eric Harris, \"it can happen to anyone.\" Harris died after Bates shot him -- accidentally, he says -- after calling out \"Taser! Taser!\" in a tussle captured on a police body camera. Bates told investigators that he mistook his firearm for the stun gun. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? While Bates is at the center of the maelstrom over Harris' death, he isn't the only one under scrutiny. The Oklahoma NAACP wants charges against other officers involved in Harris' death, and a state and federal investigation into the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office's treatment of minorities. The sheriff's office also finds itself fending off allegations that supervisors were told to forge Bates' training records. In his interview Friday with \"Today,\" Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. \"That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing,\" he told the show. And on Thursday, a sheriff's office official denied to the Tulsa World newspaper that any records had ever been forged. As an advanced reserve deputy, sheriff's office policy calls for Bates to have completed 480 hours of the field training officer program, according to the Tulsa World. Bates would also have needed firearms certification training. Officials have yet to locate records showing what training Bates completed, said Maj. Shannon Clark of the sheriff's office. But Clark did say it's possible that some training requirements may have been waived. Sheriff Stanley Glanz has the authority to waive any department policies, Clark said. \"The policies within our organization are signed off by the sheriff, but there are also policies that give the sheriff the ability to waive any policy within our organization. That's part of being a sheriff's office,\" Clark told the newspaper. Glanz told KFAQ radio this week that officials can't find records of Bates' firearms certification. The instructor who provided that training is now a U.S. Secret Service agent, and officials haven't been able to locate training records she was supposed to have turned in, Glanz told the station. Other discrepancies have surfaced about training that Bates claims to have attended, including questions about active shooter and homicide investigation instruction. Tulsa World reporter Dylan Goforth said the paper had been told by multiple sources that Bates' records had been falsified. The newspaper has not said who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why. But the orders apparently started years ago, \"back when (Bates) was trying to get on as a deputy,\" reporter Ziva Branstetter told CNN's \"New Day.\" Bates has donated equipment to the department and was also a donor to Glanz's re-election campaign, leading to allegations he had essentially paid to be a cop. He rejected that claim in the \"Today\" interview as \"unbelievably unfair.\" Bates' attorney, Clark Brewster, also has rejected the allegations of poor training or forgery as unfounded. He said those making the accusations include fired sheriff's office employees represented by the law firm that also represents Harris' family. \"His training is extensive and certainly adequate,\" Brewster told CNN on Thursday. Bates appeared on the \"Today\" show with his wife, two daughters and Brewster. He seemed composed but said he was still might be in shock over what had happened. \"I can tell you it stayed with me for a number of days,\" Bates said. \"I'm not at all sure it's not still with me today. Lack of sleep, inability to concentrate, all of those plus more. You know, I still can't believe it happened.\" In describing the events leading up to Harris' death, Bates said he was parked several blocks away from the site where an undercover deputy was conducting a sting operation to catch Harris in the act of illegally selling a gun. Bates said he had participated in \"several hundred\" such operations but always in a backup role where he would come in and \"clean up\" after deputies, taking photos and notes. But as deputies rolled up to arrest him after the sale, Harris bolted from the vehicle and ran toward Bates' position. As deputies were trying to subdue Harris, Bates told investigators he saw an opportunity to use his stun gun to help get the suspect under control. \"I yelled, 'Taser! Taser!' as required in training. The deputy below me ducked, he pulled away from it so that I could,\" Bates said. \"The laser light is the same on each weapon. I saw the light and I squeezed the trigger,\" Bates told \"Today.\" The result was not the staccato click of a well-deployed stun gun. Instead, it was a gunshot. \"I shot him! I'm sorry!\" Bates is heard emotionally saying on video of the incident. Bates apologized to Harris' family, who have rejected allegations he was violent and on drugs. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, said this week that he didn't think the shooting was racially motivated. Instead, he said, \"This is simply evil.\" But Bates,who is charged with second-degree manslaughter, said he didn't mean to kill Harris. His attorney has called it an \"excusable homicide.\" \"I rate this as No. 1 on my list of things in my life that I regret,\" said Bates, who is free on $25,000 bail.\n"], "label": "NS", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "His most recent claim to fame is the December 2014 quarry attack that resulted in the deaths of 36 people.", "reference_documents": ["Garissa, Kenya (CNN)The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud, also known by aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, is the mastermind of Thursday's Kenya university terror attack, according to a tweet from the country's Interior Ministry. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a ministry document given to CNN. Earlier, the ministry posted a \"Most Wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, which is about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's located in Kenya's North Eastern province near Somalia. CNN Exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border. Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's quarry attack, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. Also Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\"  Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya, after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a local church, as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge. To survive Al-Shabaab militants blazing through her dorm, shooting and killing classmates, 19-year-old Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds. The gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The teenager didn't see what happened next. She heard it. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Garissa is a town about 90 miles from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the lawless nation. In 2013 militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming, as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nathif Jama Adam, the governor of Garissa County. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Adam said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" He said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Adam said. Five arrested in Kenya attack. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as those who supported them. In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The latest version of the aircraft, the Super Hercules, is currently under development and set to replace the aging C-130 fleet after 2020.", "reference_documents": ["Marietta, Georgia  (CNN)The little-known star of this week's No. 1 car chase movie, \"Furious 7\" isn't a car. It's an airplane. Film producers hired a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to fly five cars 12,000 feet high, open a cargo door at the rear of the plane and parachute them out in a spectacular free-fall stunt. Geronimo! Happy 60th birthday to the Hercules -- the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history. Lockheed has been making these airplanes longer than the legendary B-52 bomber and the famous U2 spy jet. Unlike those planes, the C-130 has never become a household name. The fact that \"Furious 7\" producers chose a plane that was designed in the 1950s tells you a little something about the success of the Hercules. The film makes it appear as if another plane -- a C-17 Globemaster III -- drops the cars. But in real life, it took a Hercules to pull it off. Shooting the scene posed unique logistical challenges, said stunt coordinator Jack Gill in a featurette video about the mission. \"You start throwing all those cars out together -- you've got to figure out spacing. And these things drop very fast,\" Gill said. Jeremiah Beaudin of International Air Response co-piloted the stunt. \"We have to be very precise in our headings and our altitudes,\" he says in the video. The Hercules is big. It's tough. It's versatile. It refuels helicopters in flight. It can fly a small military force and its heavy equipment around the world -- and land on short, unfinished airstrips. At Lockheed's Marietta, Georgia, factory in 1955, the governor of Georgia christened the first production C-130A by smashing a bottle of Chattahoochee River water across its nose. The plane then proceeded to take off from nearby Dobbins Air Force Base. On Tuesday, exactly 60 years later, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal recreated the ceremony -- christening a brand new Super Hercules during a birthday party of sorts for Lockheed executives and military dignitaries. \"I'm told that the 2,500th version of this aircraft is now on the (assembly) line inside this building,\" Deal said. \"It transports, it becomes a war airplane as necessary and it is recognized as the true workhorse.\" Inside the plane's cockpit, Lockheed test pilot Steve Knoblock said he's done a lot of air-drop testing while flying C-130s. \"We've dropped some crazy things out,\" Knoblock said. \"Air dropping a car out of an airplane is easy. Whatever we can fit inside the (cargo) hold, we can drop.\" Several factors come into play for a pilot making a drop, Knoblock said, including payload weight, wind speed and timing. \"We have to give time for the car to clear the airplane, let the parachutes deploy, and then actually open,\" he said. One tricky decision involves how high the plane drops its cargo. \"There's a trade off -- between dropping it low and being more accurate ... and dropping it high where you have a little more safety in how it will land.\" Knoblock also explained how the C-130's robust landing gear helps the plane survive difficult landing conditions. \"The pilot gets to decide how hard the touchdown's going to be,\" he said. \"Sometimes to get his performance, he needs to really let it crunch on the ground. But the airplane can handle it.\" Meanwhile, in the back of the plane, Lockheed loadmaster Lucky Madsen showed off the plane's new reversible deck, which makes it easier to switch the floor from a flat surface ... to a floor with rollers embedded in it. The rollers make it easier to move cargo around and launch it out the back of the airplane. The legacy surrounding the Hercules has been built by 60 years of successful missions, including:. In 1989, a flight crew aboard a Hercules named Teal 57 was credited with saving the crew of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hurricane hunter airplane. While flying through Hurricane Hugo, the NOAA plane lost an engine and suffered damage to a second engine. Teal 57 happened to be nearby and located a safe place for the NOAA plane to escape the eye of the deadly Category 5 storm. Everyone returned safely to base. In 2012, Israeli Brig. Gen. Joshua Shani revealed how he flew a Hercules on a successful hostage rescue mission to Entebbe, Uganda. Four C-130s helped rescue passengers from a hijacked Air France flight in 1976. \"At some places that were particularly dangerous, we flew at an altitude of 35 feet,\" to evade radar. \"Trust me, this is scary!\" he told idfblog.com. During the military build up to 2003's U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a Hercules test dropped the biggest conventional weapon in the Pentagon's arsenal -- a so-called MOAB -- known in military circles as \"the mother of all bombs.\" A C-130 ejected the 21,000-pound bomb out its rear cargo door high above Florida's Eglin Air Force Base. The bomb fell to earth and detonated in a spectacular fire ball. In the past, the Air Force attached small solid-fuel rocket engines to some C-130s. The added power allowed steep takeoffs on super short runways. The Hercules wasn't designed to land on aircraft carriers. They're too short. Nonetheless, a Hercules did it -- during a test in 1963. That's how amazing this plane is. But nothing lasts forever, and the C-130 is no different. The Air Force has been developing a so-called \"super short takeoff and landing aircraft\" that might replace the Hercules after 2020. The Air Force Research Laboratory calls it Speed Agile. The proposed four-engine aircraft would be able to transport super heavy loads across oceans and to arrive and depart on short, improvised airfields. Pentagon planners apparently are hoping to create a Hercules-inspired success story that will extend into the latter half of the 21st century.\n"], "label": "NS", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Games were scheduled between the Baltimore Orioles and Boston Red Sox on Saturday and Sunday, but fans decided to stay put in their seats following the Orioles' 10th-inning win on Saturday, leaving 36,000 fans remaining in their seats.", "reference_documents": ["It seems almost silly to be writing about baseball in the context of recent events.  Except it isn't. Last weekend, as Baltimore reacted to the death of Freddie Gray, the young man who died last week from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody, Major League Baseball had a problem on its hands. Saturday's game between the Orioles and Red Sox had gone into extra innings in Camden Yards, with plenty of fans for both teams glued to their seats. Boston fans feel at home in Oriole Park -- a so-called retro urban park built to embrace the luxuries of modern stadiums while maintaining that nostalgic feel -- because much of it was based on Boston's Fenway Park. The Boston faithful are used to being in the heart of a city to watch sports.  But when the Orioles finally pulled out a win in the 10th inning, 36,000 fans remained in their seats. They had been asked to do so by Baltimore officials due to  \"ongoing public safety issues.\" The riots of Baltimore, the peaceful marches of Baltimore, the fury and unrest of Baltimore did not seem to have had much to do with baseball.  But as the always-wise Atlantic magazine writer (and Baltimore native) Ta-Nehisi Coates' take on the situation quickly went viral, it became clear that the Oriole's home stand presented a problem. Monday's game against the Chicago White Sox: postponed less than an hour before the first pitch. Tuesday's game against the White Sox: also postponed. Such action by MLB is not without precedent.  In 1967 in Detroit, the 12th Street riots forced the Tigers to postpone one game and relocate others (to Baltimore, no less).  After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., MLB postponed opening day games out of fear of mob violence.  In the wake of the 1992 verdict in the Rodney King beating, the Los Angeles Dodgers postponed several games.  The entire league went on hiatus in the wake of the terrorism and violence of September 11, 2001. Politics threaten sports all the time.  From the demonstrations against the Brazilian government before last summer's World Cup to the massacre of protesting students days before the Opening Ceremony of the Mexico City Olympics in 1968, sports knows well that it sits within the larger context of the world. Our deep investment in our teams -- beyond the tax dollars that construct the stadiums and the salaries players make (and the profits the owners and sponsors draw) -- is supposed to work to create community, to unify.  Cheering for the home team is supposed to create a sense of belonging. \"It's interesting that I have not yet heard anyone say that baseball or sport can heal this wound,\"  Daniel Nathan, professor of American Studies at Skidmore College and editor of \"Rooting for the Home Team: Sport, Community and Identity\" told me.  \"People did say that in the weeks after 9/11.  This is not 9/11 -- not even close.  But it is a serious social and cultural rupture. Painful.\" What happens next is striking.  After two postponements, the Orioles will play Chicago on Wednesday, but no one else will be invited.  In an unprecedented move by major league baseball, the public is not invited to the final game of the series, moved to the afternoon in accordance with the curfew imposed by Baltimore's mayor. While there are a few examples of fan-less games being played in the United States, none have been for such reasons, while in Europe, there have been a handful of incidents in which soccer teams have been punished for fan behavior with fan-less games. Without fans, does baseball mean anything? When the new Camden Yards made its debut in 1992, people heralded the return of the old-time stadium smack in the middle of the city.  But are the residents of that city ready to reminisce about the so-called good old days? In a recent episode of \"Real Sports,\" Chris Rock delivered a brilliant seven-minute diatribe on the fact that less than 10% of baseball players or fans are black. \"Last year, the San Francisco Giants won it all without any black guys on the team,\" he said. \"The team the Giants had to beat to get there, the St. Louis Cardinals, had no black people. None. How could you ever be in St. Louis and see no black people?\" Rock's thesis?  That baseball's sense of nostalgia encompassed by places like Camden Yards does not sit well with African Americans, whose memories of the old days are anything but good. To his credit, Orioles Executive Vice President John Angelos, son of majority owner Peter Angelos, took to Twitter to prioritize the issues at hand, focusing not on the lost games, but on the \"unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state.\" Yet as much of America continues to grapple with the idea that black lives matter, it is clear that the country believes sports do matter, whether or not anyone is there to watch. And with MLB's announcement that Baltimore's weekend games will be moved to Tampa, it becomes clear that the only thing that the United States has figured out about race relations, poverty, the achievement gap, police brutality, and so on is how to keep its baseball players safe and make sure that the games go on.\n"], "label": "NS", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": ""}

He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him in front of the class and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994 when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from industry figures including Rob Reiner and William Goldman. Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock about a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded Miramax to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by Gus Van Sant, and co-starring Damon, Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams.

Marshall personally invited Andrews to discuss the film with him; Andrews identified the director as \"the hook\" that convinced her to accept the role, having been a long-time fan of his work. She accepted the role based solely on her conversations with Marshall without reading Wendkos' script. Although Sophia Loren is rumored to have been offered the role, Marshall insists that Andrews is the first and only actress he considered, having been a fan of hers since Broadway's My Fair Lady (1956). Known for portraying princesses and nobility throughout her career, Andrews incorporated knowledge she had acquired about European royalty and mannerisms of Britain's royal family into her performance as Mia's regal mentor; Queen Elizabeth II herself had knighted Andrews one year prior, making her a Dame of the British Empire. Marshall allowed Andrews significant freedom to determine Clarisse's portrayal. Cabot was initially hesitant about Andrews' casting, fearing that the actress was too kind to play such a stern character, but ultimately relented upon seeing her interpretation, explaining that Andrews possessed \"just the right amount of regalness mixed with grandmotherly warmth\". Andrews also used the opportunity to mentor Hathaway, although she maintains that the younger actress required very little training: \"She has great instincts, good talent ... She has this ability to do humor, comedy, very well.

Our guest this morning is bringing us his first live interview from Williamsburg, where he is at the convention of CEOs. Sandy Weill is chairman and chief executive of Travelers -- or Citigroup now it is known, and is joining us from the Business Council Summit in West Virginia. We welcome you.\nSANDFORD WEILL, CITIGROUP CHAIRMAN & CEO: Thank you.\nDAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNN ANCHOR: Mr. Weill, I do want to begin, first of all, with the Federal Reserve. Everybody is seemingly talking about their expectations for what the Federal Reserve will be doing come Tuesday. Are you in the 25 or 50 basis point camp, and what are your impressions of the Fed's strategy for shaping the economy now?\nWEILL: Well, you know, I think the Fed has been trying to cool off the economy for the last year. We've had five 25 basis point increases already, and I would expect, as everybody else does, that we will have another one this coming week. Whether they do 25 basis points and continue to say that there's an outlook for further increases or they do 50 now and indicate, possibly, that they may slow down in the increases, I don't think it's really that important. I think that what they have done is beginning to affect the economy, and I think we're beginning to see the beginning of a slowdown in the economy.\nMARCHINI: It certainly has affected the stock market, we're seeing intense amounts of volatility there. What does that say to you?\nWEILL: Well, I think that we really went through a period where there was indiscriminate buying of a lot of the high-tech stocks, and I think when you think about the Internet, it's going to really revolutionize and transform our global economies, but yet, a lot of these companies that are public today won't be in existence five years from now. But I do believe that the value of all those technology stocks five years from now, as a collective, will be a lot higher than it is today.\nHAFFENREFFER: Are you concerned how a higher interest rate environment here in the U.S. might impact your shares of Citigroup?\nWEILL: I think our company is not really that affected by interest-rate increases of 100 or 150 basis points. We had had over a hundred basis point increase in rates, and yet, in the first quarter, we earned $3.6 billion, which was up 50 percent from the year before. So our company is doing very well.\nMARCHINI: When you look at the economy overall, what's your sense of it? Do you think that things are going along well?\nWEILL: You know, I think that the U.S. economy was really growing too fast, that the labor market got very, very tight, which is creating a problem for a whole host of companies in being difficult to replace workers and costs are going up somewhat. So I think that the U.S. economy cooling down a low bit is good. However, if you look around a world, the global economy is really in terrific shape: Asia's growing, Latin America's growing, Europe is starting to grow. So I think we are in an environment, from a global perspective, that is really terrific. And since this world is becoming a smaller place and we trade with each other much, much more, I think that that's really the important key to the outlook, so therefore I'm very optimistic.\nHAFFENREFFER: You speak of global growth and international growth. Yesterday, Citigroup took one step closer to the purchase of Poland's biggest corporate bank. Is Citigroup essentially done expanding in the U.S. and more angling toward growth overseas?\nWEILL: I think that we still like the U.S. market for financial services and are looking to grow some parts of our business, but we think that the growth rate in the emerging markets is going to be far higher than that in the United States. So, as you mentioned, we're buying Bank Hanloi (ph) in Poland. We're very optimistic about the Polish economy long-term. Last week, I was in Asia and we announced a strategic relationship with the Fubon Group in Taiwan with an intention to grow our insurance businesses through Asia together with them.\nMARCHINI: All right, well, clearly, you're going to be a busy man.

You just put your hand like this.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: He brainstorms with Amy about what he might come up with but says even a simple solution might take five or six tries.\nBILL SAND: I'm thinking of something that'll glide real easy, that her hand is actually sitting on.

You're out of the house. Your baby needs a diaper change, and you can't find a bathroom with a changing table. You've probably resorted to a public diaper changing. It's a little awkward for everyone involved. But when the person who needs that diaper change is a disabled or elderly adult, it can be worse than awkward.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Around the country, there are a handful of places that have installed private family restrooms equipped with adult changing tables. The airports in Phoenix, Baltimore and Orlando are a few. Sabrina Kimball of Tallahassee would like to see many more of them. She founded a group called Universal Changing Places and now joins us on the program. Welcome.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, thank you so much for having me.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'd like you to tell us the story of how you encountered this problem with your teenage son, Greyson, who had bacterial meningitis, I guess, as a very small child.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, Greyson contracted bacterial meningitis when he was a baby. He was premature. And he developed it when he was 10 days old. And unfortunately, it caused a lot of developmental delays and cerebral palsy. So Greyson is non-ambulatory. He's now 19, and he weighs about almost 75 pounds. And this has become a big challenge for us as we go out in public to try to include him in different activities.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: There is no safe clean place to change him. He has out - he outgrew the baby changing tables years ago. And what we're advocating for are powered height-adjustable adult changing tables to be added to family restrooms in different venues so that people have a safe clean place, and they're not resorting to either leaving the venue or laying their loved one on a public restroom floor.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: In the absence of such facilities, what do you do? What happens?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Mainly I leave. If I can't find - like if I'm at a mall, I will look in dressing rooms and try to see if there might be a bench that we might awkwardly do a seat cover change, but most of the time we leave, you know, unless it's a major accident. And then, you know, we have had to take out our pad and try to do something on a floor, which is, you know, not something I enjoy doing at all.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: You spoke of a seat cover change.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: (Laughter) Oh, I'm sorry. That is my nickname. As Greyson's gotten older, instead of saying a diaper change, I call them seat covers. It just sounded better because he's older.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: What are you hoping to see? What would be a reasonable public response to this problem.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: What we're hoping to see is that more and more venues like our hospitals, our malls, our rest areas, our airports will add these to their family restrooms so that you do have this facility to change somebody. It seems like such a simple thing, but it's a major thing for people that have older adults that are non-ambulatory or have self-care issues.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: It would seem to me this eliminates both a terrible physical inconvenience you'd be posed with but also some embarrassment, I should think that it addresses.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes. But also, it's an area of dignity for that person, too. I mean, how many people if you have an accident like that want to have to stay in that until they get home because there is no place to change them?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: And I talked to a gentleman when I first started my campaign. He is a quadriplegic. And the one thing he mentioned to me when I first told him about what I was doing, he said, you don't want to know how many bathroom floors I've laid on in my life.

They are both doing outstanding work each and every day. I want to acknowledge Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who is from Texas. And she is one of the members of our Science and Technology Committee and doing outstanding work. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden is in the house. Where's Charlie?\nOBAMA: And that leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our students today, especially in those fields that hold the promise of producing future innovations and innovators. And that's why education in math and science is so important. Now, the hard truth is that for decades we've been losing ground. One assessment shows American 15-year-olds now rank 21st in science and 25th in math when compared to their peers around their world. And this isn't news. We've seen warring statistics like this for years. Yet, time and again, we've let partisan and petty bickering stand in the way of progress. And time and again as a nation, we've let our children down. So I'm here and you are here because we all believe that we can't allow division and indifference to imperil our position in the world. It's time for all of us in Washington and across America to take responsibility for our future. And that's why I'm committed to moving our country from the middle to the top of the pack in science and math education over the next decade. To meet the goal, the Recovery Act included the largest investment in education in history, while preventing hundreds of thousands of educators from being fired because of state budget shortfalls. Under the outstanding leadership of Arne Duncan, we've launched a $4 billion Race to the Top fund, one of the largest investments in education reform in history. And through the Race to the Top, states won't just be receiving funding; they'll have to compete for funding. And in this competition, producing the most innovative programs in math and science will be an advantage. In addition, we are challenging states to improve achievement by raising standards, using data to better inform decisions and take new approaches to turn around struggling schools. And because a great teacher is the single most important factor in a great education, we're asking states to focus on teacher effectiveness and to make it possible for professionals, like many of the people in this room, to bring their experience and enthusiasm into the classroom. But you are here because you know that the success we seek is not going to be attained by government alone. It depends on the dedication of students and parents and the commitment of private citizens, organizations and companies. It depends on all of us. And that's why, back in April, at the National Academy of Sciences, I issued a challenge: to encourage folks to think of new and creative ways of engaging young people in science and engineering. And we are here because the leaders in this room answered that call to action. Today we are launching the Educate to Innovate Campaign, a nationwide effort to help reach the goal this administration has set: moving to the top in science and math education in the next decade. We've got leaders from private companies and universities, foundations and nonprofits and organizations representing millions of scientists, engineers and teachers from across America.\nOBAMA: The initial commitment of the private sector to this campaign is more than $260 million, and we only expect the campaign to grow. Business leaders from Intel, Xerox, Kodak and Time Warner Cable are teaming up with Sally Ride and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as the Carnegie Corporation, to find and replicate successful science, math and technology programs all across America. “Sesame Street“ has become a two-year initiative to teach young kids about math and science, and Discovery Communications is going to deliver interactive science content to 60,000 schools, reaching 35 million students. These efforts extend beyond the classroom. Time Warner Cable is joining with the Coalition for Science After School and FIRST Robotics, the program created by inventor Dean Kamen, which gave us the Cougar Cannon to connect 1 million students with fun after-school activities like robotics competitions. The MacArthur Foundation and industry leaders like Sony are launching a nationwide challenge to design compelling, freely available science-related video games. And organizations representing teachers, scientists, mathematicians and engineers, joined by volunteers in the community, are participating in a grassroots effort called National Lab Day to reach 10 million young people with hands-on learning. Students will launch rockets, construct miniature windmills and get their hands dirty. They'll have the chance to build and create, and maybe destroy just a little bit...\nOBAMA: Now, I have to say to the young people who are here, we can't let students off the hook. In the end, the success of this campaign depends on them. But I believe strongly that America's young people will rise to the challenge if given the opportunity, and given a little bit of a push. We've got to work together to create these opportunities because our future depends on them. And I just want to mention the importance not only for students but also of parents. You know, I was in Asia, I think, many of you are aware, for a week. And I was having lunch with the president of South Korea, President Lee. And I was interested in the education policy -- they've grown enormously over the last 40 years -- and I asked them what are the biggest challenges in your education policy. He said, you know, “The biggest challenge that I have is that my parents are too demanding.“"], "label": "S", "category": "TofuEval-MediaS", "additional_info": ""}

That's the old saying anyway. And some people in Cincinnati want to live up to it. Their group is called May We Help. Handymen, technicians and engineers volunteer to make devices that help people with disabilities do things that others take for granted. Cheri Lawson of member station WNKU introduces us to one of the members.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Bill Sand loves to spend time in his basement. He calls it his man cave, but there's no big screen TV, sound system or beer cooler here.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Just power tools and whatever else he needs to build things.\nBILL SAND: So these will go through the planer a few more times.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: This 66-year-old is like a lot of guys who tinker. But here's where Bill's a bit different. He designs and builds devices for people with disabilities - and he does it for free.\nBILL SAND: These are gifts that are special, that are life-changing.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Here in his home workshop, Bill has made a custom scooter for a little girl who can't walk, and cello stands for sisters, even though they don't have arms. Twelve-year-old Inga and 10-year-old Ylena Elena Petry of Pennsylvania play with their feet.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Their mom, Jennifer, says the girls used to prop their instruments on pillows on the floor. But that didn't really work out.\nJENNIFER PETRY: We needed something to keep the cellos steady.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Inga uses her toes for everything, from eating to texting.\nJENNIFER PETRY: When my mom told me that we were going to get something so that my cello wouldn't wobble, I was really happy because I'd be able to play it better.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: The Petrys are just one of the families Bill has helped pursue their dreams. He's made several one-of-a-kind devices for nine-year-old Ireland Reed. She has a rare genetic condition called Miller's Syndrome. She needs a special walker just to stand. Bill has become a regular visitor to Ireland's home in suburban Cincinnati.\nBILL SAND: Hello, Amy.\nAMY REID: Hello. How are you?\nBILL SAND: Good.\nAMY REID: Ireland, it's Bill.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Ireland is excited to see Bill, and she rolls over to him on the scooter he made for her. The family calls it her shamrock express. It's given her mobility she'd never had before. Ireland's mom, Amy, calls Bill a godsend.\nAMY REID: It's like, how do you know? Bill, how do you know what we need when we don't even know what we need?\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: During this visit, Amy says Ireland is having trouble writing with her partially formed hand. Bill crouches so he can watch carefully as the child tries to hold a pencil. He puts his hand gently around hers, thinking about what he can do to help.\nBILL SAND: Ireland, I just want your hand. You just put your hand like this.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: He brainstorms with Amy about what he might come up with but says even a simple solution might take five or six tries.\nBILL SAND: I'm thinking of something that'll glide real easy, that her hand is actually sitting on. Kind of like a mouse.\nAMY REID: We can't thank him enough. I can't find the words to really tell you how it's helped us and helped Ireland.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Bill Sand has done dozens of projects for families like the Reeds and Petrys.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Jennifer Petry says the mahogany cello stands Bill crafted for her kids are not only practical but beautiful.\nJENNIFER PETRY: Just so beautiful. And I thought these are cello stands that my girls can get on stage with and not be ashamed.\nBILL SAND: I get to be Santa all year round. You know, every time I do a project, it's like Christmas all over.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: The group May We Help is hoping to expand beyond its roots in the Midwest. They're talking about setting up a chapter in Florida and hope it will be the start to help millions of children and adults to pursue their passions despite their disabilities.

He is Minnesota's new senator -- that declared today, after a very long and contentious race. Let's take a quick listen to Al Franken at the mike.\nAL FRANKEN, WINNER OF MINNESOTA SENATE RACE: I'm thrilled and honored by the faith that Minnesotans have placed in me. I'm also humbled, not just by the closeness of this election, but by the enormity of the responsibility that comes with this office. We have a lot of work to do in Washington, but that's why I signed up for the job in the first place. When we started this campaign way back in February of 2007, I said that Americans have never backed away from tough challenges and Minnesotans have always led the way. Working with our fantastic senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to fight hard to make quality health care accessible and affordable to all Minnesotans, to make sure that our kids have an education that prepares them for a 21st century economy, to make Minnesota the epicenter of a new, renewable energy economy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil, to restore our standing in the world and put people to work here at home. To those Minnesotans who worked for me, volunteered for me, voted for me, I can't tell you how grateful I am. When you win an election this close, you know that not one bit of effort went to waste. And to those who devoted their time and energy to supporting Senator Coleman, I can only imagine how hard these past months have been. But no matter whether you voted for me or for Senator Coleman or for Senator Barkley or whether you voted at all, I want the people of Minnesota to know that I'm ready to work for all of you, that I'm committed to being a voice for all Minnesotans in the U.S. Senate. I know there's been a lot of talk about the fact that when I'm sworn in, I'll be the 60th member of the Democratic Caucus. But that's -- that's not how I see it. The way I see it, I'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic senator, I'm going to Washington to be the second senator from the State of Minnesota. And that's how I'm going to do this job.\nMALVEAUX: Minnesota's new senator, Al Franken, saying he is ready to go to work for his state. I want to bring in own Gloria Borger to kind of give us a lay of the land here. Obviously, it's a race that everybody has been following for quite some time. This is the next step now. What -- what does this mean for -- for the Democrats now that they have a larger majority?\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it means that they've got 60 seats, which would give them a filibuster-proof majority. But that's assuming that Democrats, and two Independents who we include in that, would agree on everything which is, of course, a large assumption that is not necessarily true.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: But, of course, they'll take every vote they can get at this point. Don't forget, this has been a hotly contested fight over these last eight months -- very divisive, splitting the parties in the Senate, leaving the State of Minnesota unrepresented. And so I think that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are kind of breathing a sigh of relief that it's -- that it's finally over, no matter how it was decided.\nMALVEAUX: Do you think it helps the Obama administration and the president pushing forward some of the things that have been so difficult for him, whether it's energy or health care?\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: Obviously...\nBORGER: Yes. Sure. I think it does. I mean, look, a vote is a vote is a vote. And I think Al Franken's politics are clearly more on the liberal side. So he would be more likely to go along with Barack Obama on things like climate change, on things like health care reform, than somebody like Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who's much more of a moderate who he may lose on certain votes.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: So I think that they would look at Franken as much more dependable.\nMALVEAUX: OK. Gloria Borger making sense of all of this. Thank you so much.\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: One of Michael Jackson's prized acquisitions was the rights to a vast Beatles music library.

Murray's been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson. Jackson died of an overdose of the anesthesia Propofol and other drugs. To find out what affects these drugs had, I spoke to a doctor who saw Jackson's autopsy report. His name is Dr. Zeev Cain. He is the head of the Anesthesiology Department at the University of California, Irvine.\nLEMON: You saw the toxicology report?\nDR. ZEEV CAIN, DIRECTOR, ANESTHESIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE: I saw the toxicology repot. I saw the autopsy report.\nLEMON: You did?\nCAIN: I did.\nLEMON: What was in Michael Jackson's system?\nCAIN: Several drugs, Midazolam, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Lidocaine, Epinephrine and Propofol.\nLEMON: That's a lot.\nCAIN: That's a lot of drugs. That's a lot of drugs.\nLEMON: Enough to kill someone?\nCAIN: Certainly enough to make sure that he stopped breathing, yes.\nLEMON: Yes. What did the autopsy report show?\nCAIN: Well, overall, Michael Jackson was actually in good health. There was no real problems in his internal organs. It did show, at some point in the past, he did use drugs but, again, overall, he was in excellent health.\nLEMON: What kind of drugs?\nCAIN: You can't really say that. The only thing we can do is go based on what we found in his blood.\nLEMON: OK. It didn't show one drug which the defense is saying he was addicted to. What I'm talking about,\nCAIN: Absolutely true. There was no Demerol found there, which means he did not really take Demerol for 40 days before this.\nLEMON: How many days would it have been in order for it to leave?\nCAIN: Several days. Demerol actually has a pretty long half life. So it stays in the system quite a while.\nLEMON: Yes. Were you surprised by anything in the report?\nCAIN: I would say I was surprised by what in good shape he was. Based on what I've heard previously, I expected to see more signs of chronic illness in his organs, more signs of an addict. They are not really there. He was basically healthy.\nLEMON: Yes. Yes. And to have those drugs, you said Lorazepam --\nCAIN: Diazepam, Midazolam.\nLEMON: All those drugs in there together -- does someone usually take all of those drugs together?\nCAIN: You take them if you want to induce sedation or medically induced coma. Which brings me to the issue of Propofol should not be used in home settings.\nLEMON: Yes.\nCAIN: It should be used when you want to medially induce coma or sedation in a hospital. You have to monitor somebody's blood pressure, heart rate, how well they are breathing. You have to monitor their oxygen level. That's the bottom line.\nLEMON: So, listen, people are -- this is going to be the issue now with medicine. How much can you get from doctors, depending on how much you pay? Your celebrity status? What you do for a living? All of that, is that at issue here?\nCAIN: Absolutely, it is. Remember, they found four gallons. Four gallons are enough to put to sleep about 500 people. Or it is enough to keep somebody asleep for eight hours for almost two months. Now, that may be a bit misleading, because he may have built resistance in his body already. We have to remember, when somebody does take Propofol on a regular basis, they will build up resistance. So I know some reports say it is a two-months supply. It depends how much resistance was in his body. It may only be a one week supply. We don't know.\nLEMON: Is there something we should be concerned about? I heard during the testimony that it is usually a doctor/patient relationship, and maybe this was an employee/employer relationship. Is that a concern to society overall in this case and in society, this culture where you see drugs on television and what have you?\nCAIN: To my opinion, there is a fundamental difference in the Western society versus other societies in the relations between doctor/patient. I think we need to go back to the basics and say doctors are here to take care of patients. It's not a question of you paying me for something. We are not the same as lawyers, to my opinion. We are doctors. Our first sworn duty is to take care of you. Money is secondary. We really need to take care your well being, regardless of how much you will pay for me.\nLEMON: Thank you, doctor.\nCAIN: You're welcome.\nLEMON: Dr. Zeev Cain. My thanks to him at the University of California, Irvine. Stay with CNN. There's more ahead next hour on Dr. Murray's trial.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. PAULA ZAHN, CNN ANCHOR: On to the issue of Iraq. Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, today said that Iraq is anticipating and preparing for a U.S. assault. But this morning, that same country is sending its foreign minister to New York to meet face to face with United Nations officials for the first time in over a year. But is all of this simply a diversion to hold off any possible U.S. military action? Well, joining us now is a man that knows an awful lot about all of this, Richard Butler, a former U.N. weapons inspector himself in Iraq, our ambassador-in-residence, though today he is not quite in residence. He is in his hometown of Sydney, Australia -- good morning, Richard. Do you miss us?\nRICHARD BUTLER, FORMER U.N. CHIEF WEAPONS INSPECTOR: Good morning, Paula. I sure do. I don't miss those reports of snow that's coming down the pike, especially as I was surfing this afternoon, but I sure do miss you guys. And you've got a lot of interesting stories on your hands right now.\nZAHN: Yes, we do. Let's have you walk us through this dance that is expected to happen later...\nBUTLER: Right.\nZAHN: ... today at the U.N. This happens at a time, when the U.S. government now has satellite pictures showing the Iraqis have turned trucks that were meant for humanitarian use into military trucks.\nBUTLER: Well, Paula, the Iraqis have had three years to do such things, three years without inspections, and throughout that period, they have claimed that they have no weapons of mass destruction. I want to say very simply that's a lie. And as Colin Powell has said very often, if that is the truth, why not have inspectors come back and look and see and prove to the world that you don't have any of those weapons? Well, here they are today at the U.N. talking about having inspectors come back. That's a real wrench for them, because Saddam's deepest interest is in keeping weapons of mass destruction and, therefore, not having inspectors. So why are they doing this? Paula, they are doing it, because they are scared stiff of U.S. military action, and this is a ploy to try to head off that action by saying, hey, wait a minute. We are going to come back under the law. We are going to have inspectors come into our country. That's what it's about.\nZAHN: But, Richard, realistically how much time can the Iraqis buy here?\nBUTLER: I don't think very much, and the devil will be in the detail. You see, Kofi Annan, the secretary general, has made clear that there is only one subject on the agenda, which is that you come back -- you, Iraq, come back into conformity with the law, and the law says they must be inspected and those weapons of mass destruction removed. What Iraq will do is say, OK, we are prepared to do that, but we want to know exactly what those inspections will look like, what will be the rules. In other words, they will start, I think, that same game they have played with my team in the past, a sort of shell game, where through procedural and other devices, they will seek to prevent the inspections from being effective. That's what the U.S. has to watch out for, because if it looks like the secretary general or the international community is going to allow Iraq to have inspections, but inspections which are useless, some would say worse than useless, then that will be a serious problem. I don't think they'll get away with it. They are going to try it, but the short answer to your question is that, no, I don't think it will work.\nZAHN: All right. But how much does it hurt the Iraqis' case that this information has become public now, 24 hours in advance of these important high-level meetings, that they have converted these trucks into trucks of wartime use potentially?\nBUTLER: Well, I think it does hurt their case, but let's not be too sanguine about that. This sort of information has been around for a very long time, but Iraq has had sufficient supporters -- political supporters to try to water it down or dismiss its significance. Some will argue that this information has come to light on the eve of these talks and is therefore in some way an attempt to prejudice the, you know, the outcome of those talks. The politics of this are very complex. Now, they had clarified somewhat since September 11, and certainly in the Iraqi mind, the president got their attention with his State of the Union speech, when he made very clear that the U.S. is not going to sit back and wait for countries like Iraq, declared to be part of the so-called axis of evil, to develop weapons of mass destruction. That if it's seen that they have them, the U.S. will take action first. Now, in the meantime, it has been made clear that before that action takes place, there will be one more attempt to get serious inspections back into Iraq. This is what we are seeing unfold today. Will it work? Will it result in serious inspections? Will it hold off U.S. action? I strongly doubt it, because Saddam's first and basic interest is in keeping his weapons of mass destruction, and frankly I think whatever inspections are agreed to, it probably won't be real.\nZAHN: Well, we are going to be watching this very closely from here at CNN -- Richard, good to see you again. We are very jealous that you have been surfing, but we can't complain too badly about the weather here.\nBUTLER: Well, I'll be back with you soon, I hope.\nZAHN: Travel well.

Carol, there is a lot of renewed activity here in this very hot and dusty part of northern Afghanistan. The latest reports that we've been receiving are from several hundred kilometers from where I'm standing right now, reports, though, coming from General Fahim who is the military commander of those anti-Taliban Northern Alliance forces. He said that on Tuesday his men launched an attack on Taliban positions, hundreds of kilometers, as I say, from where I'm standing right now, managed to capture some 15 square kilometers of very rugged terrain but also as part of that, 75 Taliban fighters, he said, along with three quite important senior Taliban commanders. Now one of the things that's been coming out from officials here at the Northern Alliance headquarters is that one of the problems they're seeing a lot more of they say are fighters from other countries outside of Afghanistan, from the Arab states. From countries specifically like Pakistan, they say, who are coming and fighting alongside the Taliban. Now this has been happening throughout the long-running civil war here in Afghanistan. Many of those people have been captured, along with Taliban fighters, and a lot of them are held in prisoner of war camps in the heart of the -- of the Northern Alliance stronghold in the Panjshir Valley.\nCHANCE (voice-over): Captives from years of bitter Afghan conflicts, devout Muslims but still hardened fighters who've battle on the side of the Taliban and others but lost. Most are native Afghans, but there are nationals here from Yemen, Iraq, even China, all held by the Northern Alliance as prisoners of war. Sola Adin told me he's from Pakistan, an Islamic fighter, he said, trained on Afghan soil in a base run by none other than Osama bin Laden. The claim is impossible to verify and made within earshot of prison guards.\nSOLA ADIN, PRISONER OF WAR: When our enemy he was very strong and we was weak and we cannot fight face to face with our enemy and that time we fight -- terrorism.\nCHANCE: So what kind of things are we talking about? We're talking about bombings? We're talking about kidnappings?\nADIN: Bombings and killing the sniper and hijacking and every very much.\nCHANCE: Off camera he said he spoke under duress. The warning shots are from guards high above this isolated prison. Three times a day there are prayers outside in the windswept Panjshir Valley. Northern Alliance commanders say each of these captives is investigated to extract, in their words, any useful information. “We can gather very important intelligence on enemy bases and military strategy,“ this prison official said. “It's information the Americans could also use,“ he said, “if they would ask.“ There are reports of contact with Washington. Most of these fighters have already been held for years, too long to be of much intelligence gathering use. (on camera): There's word here the coming days could bring more prisoners from a fresh upsurge in fighting in the mountains behind me and perhaps also with fresh information not just on the Taliban but, according to Northern Alliance officials here, on the organization of Osama bin Laden himself. (voice-over): It may be prisoners in Afghanistan's long-running civil war that prove one vital source ahead of any U.S.-led attack.\nCHANCE: Let's turn briefly now to the diplomatic efforts underway. And I spoke earlier today local time to the Foreign Minister of the Northern Alliance, Dr. Abdallah Abdallah. And he told me that there was still daily contacts he said between him, between his officials and officials of the United States administration. He said the entire range of options was being discussed with them, including the military one. He wouldn't go any further than that though and tell us exactly what was being discussed. But he did hint to us again very strongly that in his mind and in the minds of senior Northern Alliance officials here they are expecting in the days or weeks ahead some kind of attack possibly in conjunction with their forces on Afghanistan by the United States -- Carol.\nLIN: All right, and they have been saying that from the very beginning so we'll see what happens. Thank you very much. Matthew Chance reporting live from northern Afghanistan. He is with the Northern Alliance in their civil war.

Our guest this morning is bringing us his first live interview from Williamsburg, where he is at the convention of CEOs. Sandy Weill is chairman and chief executive of Travelers -- or Citigroup now it is known, and is joining us from the Business Council Summit in West Virginia. We welcome you.\nSANDFORD WEILL, CITIGROUP CHAIRMAN & CEO: Thank you.\nDAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNN ANCHOR: Mr. Weill, I do want to begin, first of all, with the Federal Reserve. Everybody is seemingly talking about their expectations for what the Federal Reserve will be doing come Tuesday. Are you in the 25 or 50 basis point camp, and what are your impressions of the Fed's strategy for shaping the economy now?\nWEILL: Well, you know, I think the Fed has been trying to cool off the economy for the last year. We've had five 25 basis point increases already, and I would expect, as everybody else does, that we will have another one this coming week. Whether they do 25 basis points and continue to say that there's an outlook for further increases or they do 50 now and indicate, possibly, that they may slow down in the increases, I don't think it's really that important. I think that what they have done is beginning to affect the economy, and I think we're beginning to see the beginning of a slowdown in the economy.\nMARCHINI: It certainly has affected the stock market, we're seeing intense amounts of volatility there. What does that say to you?\nWEILL: Well, I think that we really went through a period where there was indiscriminate buying of a lot of the high-tech stocks, and I think when you think about the Internet, it's going to really revolutionize and transform our global economies, but yet, a lot of these companies that are public today won't be in existence five years from now. But I do believe that the value of all those technology stocks five years from now, as a collective, will be a lot higher than it is today.\nHAFFENREFFER: Are you concerned how a higher interest rate environment here in the U.S. might impact your shares of Citigroup?\nWEILL: I think our company is not really that affected by interest-rate increases of 100 or 150 basis points. We had had over a hundred basis point increase in rates, and yet, in the first quarter, we earned $3.6 billion, which was up 50 percent from the year before. So our company is doing very well.\nMARCHINI: When you look at the economy overall, what's your sense of it? Do you think that things are going along well?\nWEILL: You know, I think that the U.S. economy was really growing too fast, that the labor market got very, very tight, which is creating a problem for a whole host of companies in being difficult to replace workers and costs are going up somewhat. So I think that the U.S. economy cooling down a low bit is good. However, if you look around a world, the global economy is really in terrific shape: Asia's growing, Latin America's growing, Europe is starting to grow. So I think we are in an environment, from a global perspective, that is really terrific. And since this world is becoming a smaller place and we trade with each other much, much more, I think that that's really the important key to the outlook, so therefore I'm very optimistic.\nHAFFENREFFER: You speak of global growth and international growth. Yesterday, Citigroup took one step closer to the purchase of Poland's biggest corporate bank. Is Citigroup essentially done expanding in the U.S. and more angling toward growth overseas?\nWEILL: I think that we still like the U.S. market for financial services and are looking to grow some parts of our business, but we think that the growth rate in the emerging markets is going to be far higher than that in the United States. So, as you mentioned, we're buying Bank Hanloi (ph) in Poland. We're very optimistic about the Polish economy long-term. Last week, I was in Asia and we announced a strategic relationship with the Fubon Group in Taiwan with an intention to grow our insurance businesses through Asia together with them.\nMARCHINI: All right, well, clearly, you're going to be a busy man. Sandy Weill, chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, we thank you for joining us this morning from the Green Brier."], "label": "S", "category": "TofuEval-MediaS", "additional_info": ""}

The U.S. flag raised above the American embassy in Havana for the first time in 54 years. The U.S. and Cuba marking their resumption of diplomatic relations. But what happens now between the two countries? Joining me from Houston, CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, and in New York, Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, whose father Arthur Schlesinger worked in and wrote extensively about the Kennedy White House. Good to see both of you.\nDOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Thank you.\nSTEPHEN SCHLESINGER, ADJUNCT FELLOW, CENTURY FOUNDATION: Nice to see you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. So, Stephen, to you first. You know, what was that moment like for you, and did your dad ever talk about possibly seeing that kind of day, or that day happening, like what we saw yesterday?\nSCHLESINGER: I think he always wanted this day to happen. I don't think he would have realized it was going to take another 50 years. You know, it's quite remarkable. Ten presidents I believe have been in office since the embargo was instituted against Cuba. Finally, we have a president who made a breakthrough and it's a very impressive turnaround, and I think it will pay very much dividends, both with our relationship with Cuba as well as with the entire Latin American community.\nWHITFIELD: And so, Douglas, you know, this ceremony was full of symbolism, you know, from the U.S. Marines involved 54 years ago, taking the flag down, to now being the ones to help raise the flag. Apparently the cane that Secretary of State, you know, Kerry was walking on also had its significance there. How important was this moment to set a tone, so to speak, of how these two countries will be working together this day forward?\nBRINKLEY: Well, it's a very important tone-setting moment for John Kerry. It's one of the high watermarks of his tenure as secretary of state. Barack Obama will most likely get very high marks in history for kind of healing U.S.-Cuban relations. But we've got to be cautious here. Embassies can open and they can close. We had an embassy in Venezuela, in Caracas, running and then we shut it down. We'll have to see. We're not -- the friendship with the United States and Cuba is not ironclad at this juncture. There's still human rights issues. And if we ever find out that Cuba is in some ways sponsoring terrorism against the United States, things could dissolve. But for the moment, as Stephen Schlesinger said, this is a very healing moment after this many decades of the United States and Cuba at each other's throats. It looks like now a friendship is blooming.\nWHITFIELD: And blooming in what way do you see, Stephen? Because yes, unfinished business. We're still talking about, you know, an embargo that has yet to be lifted. It takes an act of Congress in order for that to happen. But what do you see next in the short term as opposed to the long term?\nSCHLESINGER: Well, I think there are going to be a series of small steps. I think Doug is quite right that -- you know, Cuba is not going to change overnight. In fact, it may not change for years. So the small steps are important. I think right now Secretary Kerry has been talking about some of them. For example, dealing with narcotics interdiction, or the environment, or issues of financial transactions or agriculture or telecommunications. All those issues are pretty straightforward and can be dealt with in a bilateral basis. But when you get into the issues of human rights, the settlement of expropriated property of Cubans and Americans, and issues of democracy, it's -- you're talking about a much longer-term situation.\nWHITFIELD: And then, Douglas, you know, just listening to the ceremony and listening to the -- whether it be the poet or even Secretary Kerry, some beautiful, you know, words that were being used. And when using language like, you know, as two peoples who are no longer enemies or rivals, but neighbors playing the Cuban national anthem first, and then later playing, you know, the U.S. national anthem. In what way do you see those as, you know, significant moves in order to really kind of thaw the ice?\nBRINKLEY: Well, I think the Cuban people and the American people have a shared rich history. And so one of the ways that the ice thawing is going to happen are cultural exchanges. Students going down to Cuba now. People going to do tourism. I went down to Cuba just to see the sight of the Bay of Pigs invasion. And went to see where Theodore Roosevelt's, you know, history down there. It's an amazing place, Havana. So I think the influx of American tourists going to Cuba is going to be quite remarkable. And when people start talking and dialoguing, sharing music, food, it's a chance for these two countries to get much closer. And also Fidel Castro is on his last legs, so to speak. And Raul Castro has shown more of an -- shown signs that he liked to get along with the United States. So for some people that remember the Cuban missile crisis, this is really a moment to celebrate when tensions are at an all-time low right now.\nWHITFIELD: Yes, neither of the Castros were there, but, you know, their aura, indeed.\nWHITFIELD: You know, is certainly in the vicinity.\nBRINKLEY: Yes.\nWHITFIELD: Stephen Schlesinger and Douglas Brinkley, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.\nBRINKLEY: Thanks.\nSCHLESINGER: Thank you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. We'll be right back."], "label": "S", "category": "TofuEval-MediaS", "additional_info": ""}

Consumers personal information is a billion-dollar business for data brokers and marketers in this country. Now the Internal Revenue Service believes the information in your tax return should be for sale, to them. And for the first time, it wants to allow accountants and tax preparation companies such as H&R; Block to sell your personal information. Lisa Sylvester reports.\nLISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Your tax returns are in many ways a map of your entire life. How much you make, your medical cost, charitable donations. It's all there. An Internal Revenue Service proposal would allow tax preparers to sell that information to marketing companies and data brokers.\nBETH GIVENS, PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE: I think this is a shockingly bad idea, to allow tax preparers to sell these very sensitive documents. The information contained tells a lot about us, about our families.\nSYLVESTER: The IRS ironically claims that its doing this to improve consumer protections. The agency argues that it would require consent before tax returns could be sent overseas for processing or disclosed to third parties. In a statement, the IRS commissioner said, “The heart of this proposed regulation is about the right of taxpayers to control their tax return information.“ But many consumers could unwittingly sign away their privacy.\nPETER SWIRE, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: The permission here is fake permission. The accountant sets all the little tabs out there and little red tabs and says sign here in all these places. And then you sign the consent and your record is now being sold to a database company.\nSYLVESTER: It's hard to see why consumers would want to have their information sold.\nBETH MCCONNELL, PENN. PIRG: I think it's incredibly significant, not only given the epidemic of identity theft that affects more than 9 million Americans every single year, but also just the barrage of marketing and advertising that consumers are already having a hard time controlling.\nSYLVESTER: Consumer groups say for individuals, there's nothing to gain by having their records sold and everything to lose.\nSYLVESTER: H&R; Block did not return our calls for comment on this story. And there's a real sense that the IRS was trying to fly this one in under the radar. It called the change not a significant regulatory action, although most taxpayers would probably beg to differ, Lou.\nDOBBS: Well, it is under the heading of, you can't make this stuff up. The Internal Revenue Service saying that we would be sharing our personal tax information to protect the privacy of our tax information. It's Orwellian.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "President Obama announced new private-public partnerships aimed at boosting science and math education.", "reference_documents": ["HARRIS: And President Obama in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building now highlighting several initiatives this morning to boost science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... and Secretary Steven Chu, who is our energy secretary. They are both doing outstanding work each and every day. I want to acknowledge Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who is from Texas. And she is one of the members of our Science and Technology Committee and doing outstanding work. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden is in the house. Where's Charlie?\nOBAMA: And that leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our students today, especially in those fields that hold the promise of producing future innovations and innovators. And that's why education in math and science is so important. Now, the hard truth is that for decades we've been losing ground. One assessment shows American 15-year-olds now rank 21st in science and 25th in math when compared to their peers around their world. And this isn't news. We've seen warring statistics like this for years. Yet, time and again, we've let partisan and petty bickering stand in the way of progress. And time and again as a nation, we've let our children down. So I'm here and you are here because we all believe that we can't allow division and indifference to imperil our position in the world. It's time for all of us in Washington and across America to take responsibility for our future. And that's why I'm committed to moving our country from the middle to the top of the pack in science and math education over the next decade. To meet the goal, the Recovery Act included the largest investment in education in history, while preventing hundreds of thousands of educators from being fired because of state budget shortfalls. Under the outstanding leadership of Arne Duncan, we've launched a $4 billion Race to the Top fund, one of the largest investments in education reform in history. And through the Race to the Top, states won't just be receiving funding; they'll have to compete for funding. And in this competition, producing the most innovative programs in math and science will be an advantage. In addition, we are challenging states to improve achievement by raising standards, using data to better inform decisions and take new approaches to turn around struggling schools. And because a great teacher is the single most important factor in a great education, we're asking states to focus on teacher effectiveness and to make it possible for professionals, like many of the people in this room, to bring their experience and enthusiasm into the classroom. But you are here because you know that the success we seek is not going to be attained by government alone. It depends on the dedication of students and parents and the commitment of private citizens, organizations and companies. It depends on all of us. And that's why, back in April, at the National Academy of Sciences, I issued a challenge: to encourage folks to think of new and creative ways of engaging young people in science and engineering. And we are here because the leaders in this room answered that call to action. Today we are launching the Educate to Innovate Campaign, a nationwide effort to help reach the goal this administration has set: moving to the top in science and math education in the next decade. We've got leaders from private companies and universities, foundations and nonprofits and organizations representing millions of scientists, engineers and teachers from across America.\nOBAMA: The initial commitment of the private sector to this campaign is more than $260 million, and we only expect the campaign to grow. Business leaders from Intel, Xerox, Kodak and Time Warner Cable are teaming up with Sally Ride and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as the Carnegie Corporation, to find and replicate successful science, math and technology programs all across America. “Sesame Street“ has become a two-year initiative to teach young kids about math and science, and Discovery Communications is going to deliver interactive science content to 60,000 schools, reaching 35 million students. These efforts extend beyond the classroom. Time Warner Cable is joining with the Coalition for Science After School and FIRST Robotics, the program created by inventor Dean Kamen, which gave us the Cougar Cannon to connect 1 million students with fun after-school activities like robotics competitions. The MacArthur Foundation and industry leaders like Sony are launching a nationwide challenge to design compelling, freely available science-related video games. And organizations representing teachers, scientists, mathematicians and engineers, joined by volunteers in the community, are participating in a grassroots effort called National Lab Day to reach 10 million young people with hands-on learning. Students will launch rockets, construct miniature windmills and get their hands dirty. They'll have the chance to build and create, and maybe destroy just a little bit...\nOBAMA: Now, I have to say to the young people who are here, we can't let students off the hook. In the end, the success of this campaign depends on them. But I believe strongly that America's young people will rise to the challenge if given the opportunity, and given a little bit of a push. We've got to work together to create these opportunities because our future depends on them. And I just want to mention the importance not only for students but also of parents. You know, I was in Asia, I think, many of you are aware, for a week. And I was having lunch with the president of South Korea, President Lee. And I was interested in the education policy -- they've grown enormously over the last 40 years -- and I asked them what are the biggest challenges in your education policy. He said, you know, “The biggest challenge that I have is that my parents are too demanding.“"], "label": "S", "category": "TofuEval-MediaS", "additional_info": ""}

You're out of the house. Your baby needs a diaper change, and you can't find a bathroom with a changing table. You've probably resorted to a public diaper changing. It's a little awkward for everyone involved. But when the person who needs that diaper change is a disabled or elderly adult, it can be worse than awkward.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Around the country, there are a handful of places that have installed private family restrooms equipped with adult changing tables. The airports in Phoenix, Baltimore and Orlando are a few. Sabrina Kimball of Tallahassee would like to see many more of them. She founded a group called Universal Changing Places and now joins us on the program. Welcome.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, thank you so much for having me.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'd like you to tell us the story of how you encountered this problem with your teenage son, Greyson, who had bacterial meningitis, I guess, as a very small child.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, Greyson contracted bacterial meningitis when he was a baby. He was premature. And he developed it when he was 10 days old. And unfortunately, it caused a lot of developmental delays and cerebral palsy. So Greyson is non-ambulatory. He's now 19, and he weighs about almost 75 pounds. And this has become a big challenge for us as we go out in public to try to include him in different activities.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: There is no safe clean place to change him. He has out - he outgrew the baby changing tables years ago. And what we're advocating for are powered height-adjustable adult changing tables to be added to family restrooms in different venues so that people have a safe clean place, and they're not resorting to either leaving the venue or laying their loved one on a public restroom floor.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: In the absence of such facilities, what do you do? What happens?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Mainly I leave. If I can't find - like if I'm at a mall, I will look in dressing rooms and try to see if there might be a bench that we might awkwardly do a seat cover change, but most of the time we leave, you know, unless it's a major accident. And then, you know, we have had to take out our pad and try to do something on a floor, which is, you know, not something I enjoy doing at all.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: You spoke of a seat cover change.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: (Laughter) Oh, I'm sorry. That is my nickname. As Greyson's gotten older, instead of saying a diaper change, I call them seat covers. It just sounded better because he's older.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: What are you hoping to see? What would be a reasonable public response to this problem.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: What we're hoping to see is that more and more venues like our hospitals, our malls, our rest areas, our airports will add these to their family restrooms so that you do have this facility to change somebody. It seems like such a simple thing, but it's a major thing for people that have older adults that are non-ambulatory or have self-care issues.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: It would seem to me this eliminates both a terrible physical inconvenience you'd be posed with but also some embarrassment, I should think that it addresses.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes. But also, it's an area of dignity for that person, too. I mean, how many people if you have an accident like that want to have to stay in that until they get home because there is no place to change them?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: And I talked to a gentleman when I first started my campaign. He is a quadriplegic. And the one thing he mentioned to me when I first told him about what I was doing, he said, you don't want to know how many bathroom floors I've laid on in my life. And I was like - it just broke my heart. I'm thinking this is not right. This is something we can do something about.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: That is Sabrina Kimball speaking to us via Skype from Tallahassee.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Argentina suffered a shocking 3-0 loss to Croatia, making it difficult to advance.", "reference_documents": ["GORANI: A major shocker at the World Cup right now. Just minutes ago, Argentina lost to Croatia three nail. That would make it extremely difficult for Argentina to advance out of their group. On the pitch today, France beat Peru, one nail. Yay. Which moves them into the knockout stage of the World Cup. Russia and Uruguay, so far, are the only other teams to advance. Russia's success certainly is a surprise. They came into the cup as the lowest rated team in the tournament. They have something called a home advantage though, I think Fred Pleitgen has been following the Russian national team and he's in Moscow. Fred.\nFREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hala, we visited their training camp earlier today and what we saw there was a very confident team, obviously bolstered by those two win that they got and a team that believes that they could do great things at the World Cup. And so now does this nation. Here's what we saw.\nPLEITGEN: It's not often that you see Russians this emotional. But the country's been in a football frenzy ever since the World Cup started. Thanks to Russia's Cinderella squad, a team most experts thought would fail miserably, but has outscored its opponents Eight to one so far. Defender Andrei Semyonov told me the team always believed in itself. Nobody believed in us, he says, now everyone does and they're starting to put medals on us. But we don't look at it. We studied our opponents really well and predicted everything. But few observers could have predicted their success. Russia is the lowest ranked team at the World Cup. Wouldn't have even qualified if they weren't the host nation. And many feared the mood at the World Cup would sour and the home team performed poorly. Now, the squad, led by striker Artem Dzyuba is on a roll. Team Russia has already proved all of its critics wrong, well, in all of its matches and already qualifying for the next round. And now both this nation and this team believe they can do great things at the FIFA 2018 World Cup. And with a successful squad, Russians are embracing their nation's role as hosts of the tournament. Striker Fyodor Kudryashov telling me, home field advantage has also helped elevate the team's performance. The fans are the 12th player on the field for us, he said. We feel their overwhelming support and our team goes forward. If there is a knock on the Russians, it's that they haven't played any of the really strong teams so far. But for now, Russia is enjoying the winning streak, hoping their World Cup fairy tale doesn't end any time soon.\nPLEITGEN: And, Hala, of course the next game they have will be against the stronger team, it's against Uruguay. And after that, of course, we get to the knockout stages and it's really going to be there that the Russians are going to show whether they are for real or not, Hala.\nGORANI: Yes, we will be watching. Thanks, Fred. For Shakespeare, it was the sonnet, for Rembrandt and Picasso, a masterpiece painted in oils. But in this day and age, there seems to be only one way to truly honor the special moments in our life.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let me take a selfie.

How many wives? There were three. Ivanna, they had three children together. Then, of course, there was Marla Maples, the other woman. They had a daughter. And the last, he's currently married to Milania Trump. They have a son together. Now to the mogul's political aspirations - Trump is scheduled to speak at this Tea Party rally in Boca Raton, Florida. He'll bring his comments to you. Trump is considering running for president. He's expected to make a final decision by June. Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak may be on the move. An army spokesman tells CNN Mubarak was transferred from a hospital in Sharm el Sheikh to a military facility in Cairo. Several riot police standing guard outside the hospital say Mubarak is still there. The former president is under investigation for the deaths of protesters during the recent uprising. Government forces are pounding Libya's third largest city with rockets. Rebels say Gadhafi troops shelled a neighborhood, killing three people. It comes one day after a human rights group claims government forces fired cluster bombs into civilian areas. And at least five NATO service members and four Afghan soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. The bomber was wearing an Afghan national army uniform. In Cuba this weekend, it's national celebration and an important gathering of the communist government. CNN's Shasta Darlington was in Havana today, and you had watched this huge military parade 50 years after the invasion of the Bay of Pigs, really interesting historically.\nSHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Deb. This was a massive celebration of Cuba's past victories. We saw tanks rumbling through revolution plaza, tighter jets flying overhead. Thousands of troops and civilians, people from the neighborhoods coming out and marching in support of their revolution and in celebration of these major victories. It was 50 years ago this small Caribbean island defeated a U.S.-backed invasion of the Bay of Pigs. It was led by Cuban exiles, but it was really considered a defeat for Washington. They failed to provide air support. And of course Cubans never rose up and joined in the fight. A major victory, of course, for Cuba. This afternoon we'll see, as you mentioned, he was going to start looking for the future. The leaders will meet behind closed doors for a four-day meeting of the communist party. In fact, it's the first Congress of the communist party in nearly 14 years. They're going to focus on the economy and needed reforms there. President Raul Castro has called for more private enterprise and less of a role from the state. They want to do major layoffs in the state sector and allow more people to get into business for themselves in things like plumbing, gardening, opening up restaurants. They'll also talk property ownership, which could mean Cubans for the first time in decades could buy and sell homes and possibly even all those old cars could be affected if they allow Cubans to buy and sell more modern vehicles, Deb.\nFEYERICK: Shasta, I read something like 170,000 Cubans have actually taken out licenses to open their own business. Very quickly, why 14 years? Are communists coming from elsewhere? Is this an internal meeting of the leaders there in Cuba?\nDARLINGTON: Deb, it's a good question. They should be holding these meetings every five years. We haven't had one since 1997. Part of the disruption was, of course, when Fidel Castro fell ill, there was the transition from one government to another. Then massive hurricanes sort of hit the economy, global crisis, lots of different reasons. But they couldn't wait any longer. This is probably the first Congress solely dedicated to economic reform and the time is right. They knew they had to do something, and president Raul Castro has already called for many of these reforms. They're hoping to get even more done once they ever got the leaders together.\nFEYERICK: We will be keeping an eye on it, Shasta Darlington in Cuba. Thank you so much.

The International Olympic Committee has elected Jacques Rogge of Belgium to an eight-year term, replacing Juan Antonio Samaranch, of Spain. The two met with reporters in Moscow, including our Patrick Snell, who's there.\nPATRICK SNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Colleen, that's right: the Samaranch era has officially come to an end after 21 years. Now all eyes will be focusing on the 59-year old orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, Jacques Rogge. Out of all the candidates, in terms of sporting politics, he was perhaps the man with the least experience -- but his very, very widespread reputation is of being a smooth diplomat; an IOC problem solver, if you like; and a man widely credited with organizing the phenomenally successful Sydney, Australia, Games last year. Rogge has a great sporting background himself. He competed in the '68, '72, and '76 Olympic Games, as a sailor, and also played rugby for his country, and is today happy to share center stage with the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch -- and a really lovely touch when he presented Samaranch himself with an Olympic Gold Medal for his own achievements. Absolutely typical of the man -- smooth talking -- and a very, very popular decision. Now a word about the rivals he beat. Rogge in the second round of voting, he won. He totaled 59 votes. That was well clear of his closest rival, the South Korean politician Un-yong Kim, who got 23 votes. That's one clear of the Canadian lawyer, Dick Pound. So the new IOC president, the Belgian Jacques Rogge -- Colleen.\nMCEDWARDS: All right, thanks very much, Patrick.\nBRIAN NELSON, CNN ANCHOR: And our next guest is Melinda McKay. She's the senior vice president of a company called Jones Lang LaSalle. This is a firm that did an Olympic study on the long-term impact that cities who've received the Olympic Games are able to benefit from. And they've gone back and studied Sydney, Atlanta, Barcelona, and Seoul. So we now introduce Melinda McKay. Let's talk about Beijing. First of all, thank you for being with us, Ms. McKay. Why the study and who paid for it -- very quickly.\nMELINDA MCKAY, JONES LANG LASALLE: The study was done based on the fact that I was actually in Sydney last year, and I was seeing firsthand what was happening in the markets, the sort of infrastructure developments that were occurring and I thought it would be very interesting for our clients to actually take a look at what happened in past host cities and see if there were any consistencies across that.\nNELSON: Summarize what you found.\nMCKAY: We found that although there are certainly short-term economic gains to be had from the Olympics -- between $3 billion and $17 billion, depending on which of the past four host cities you look at. But really, the long-term legacy is in the change to the urban form of the city. At least the past four Olympic host cities have really used the Games to revitalize rundown urban areas.\nNELSON: All right and what would be the biggest example you'd like to point to?\nMCKAY: I would take the Sydney experience, because as I said before, I was seeing it first hand. They essentially turned the Olympic Village from a munitions dump -- it was an unusable industrial front -- into the world's most environmentally friendly suburb. And if you take the Atlanta example, they spent $1 billion on capital works as a result of the Games and have revitalized the downtown area.\nNELSON: In Atlanta, there was a change, in a sense, to the infrastructure around the Centennial Park, which was created to honor the Olympics. But by and large, some people may question whether all of this was worth the millions and millions -- or maybe I should say billions of dollars -- that are poured into getting the Olympic Games. Does it really balance out?\nMCKAY: I really do think it does, if you just take a pure look at the net economic gain that is measured from the Olympic Games -- and it, as I said before, ranges between $3 billion and $17 billion, and that's just the short-term gain; you've got the long-term changes to the urban form, which are just tremendous.\nNELSON: For residents of Beijing, if the city goes ahead and keeps its promises, what should residents be seeing by the year 2008 to their city?\nMCKAY: The Beijing of 2008 will definitely be significantly different from the city that we see now. Beijing is spending $12.2 billion on environmental improvements and antipollution measures. They're spending $3.7 billion on transport infrastructure. They are turning their Olympic Village -- the Olympic Green -- into a 200-acre park, and they're surrounding that by a nature park as well. So there are very exciting changes that we'll see for Beijing.\nNELSON: Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us this morning, Melinda McKay, from Jones Lang LaSalle, and we appreciate your being here.\nMCKAY: Thank you.

Consumers personal information is a billion-dollar business for data brokers and marketers in this country. Now the Internal Revenue Service believes the information in your tax return should be for sale, to them. And for the first time, it wants to allow accountants and tax preparation companies such as H&R; Block to sell your personal information. Lisa Sylvester reports.\nLISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Your tax returns are in many ways a map of your entire life. How much you make, your medical cost, charitable donations. It's all there. An Internal Revenue Service proposal would allow tax preparers to sell that information to marketing companies and data brokers.\nBETH GIVENS, PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE: I think this is a shockingly bad idea, to allow tax preparers to sell these very sensitive documents. The information contained tells a lot about us, about our families.\nSYLVESTER: The IRS ironically claims that its doing this to improve consumer protections. The agency argues that it would require consent before tax returns could be sent overseas for processing or disclosed to third parties. In a statement, the IRS commissioner said, “The heart of this proposed regulation is about the right of taxpayers to control their tax return information.“ But many consumers could unwittingly sign away their privacy.\nPETER SWIRE, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: The permission here is fake permission. The accountant sets all the little tabs out there and little red tabs and says sign here in all these places. And then you sign the consent and your record is now being sold to a database company.\nSYLVESTER: It's hard to see why consumers would want to have their information sold.\nBETH MCCONNELL, PENN. PIRG: I think it's incredibly significant, not only given the epidemic of identity theft that affects more than 9 million Americans every single year, but also just the barrage of marketing and advertising that consumers are already having a hard time controlling.\nSYLVESTER: Consumer groups say for individuals, there's nothing to gain by having their records sold and everything to lose.\nSYLVESTER: H&R; Block did not return our calls for comment on this story. And there's a real sense that the IRS was trying to fly this one in under the radar. It called the change not a significant regulatory action, although most taxpayers would probably beg to differ, Lou.\nDOBBS: Well, it is under the heading of, you can't make this stuff up. The Internal Revenue Service saying that we would be sharing our personal tax information to protect the privacy of our tax information. It's Orwellian.

He is Minnesota's new senator -- that declared today, after a very long and contentious race. Let's take a quick listen to Al Franken at the mike.\nAL FRANKEN, WINNER OF MINNESOTA SENATE RACE: I'm thrilled and honored by the faith that Minnesotans have placed in me. I'm also humbled, not just by the closeness of this election, but by the enormity of the responsibility that comes with this office. We have a lot of work to do in Washington, but that's why I signed up for the job in the first place. When we started this campaign way back in February of 2007, I said that Americans have never backed away from tough challenges and Minnesotans have always led the way. Working with our fantastic senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to fight hard to make quality health care accessible and affordable to all Minnesotans, to make sure that our kids have an education that prepares them for a 21st century economy, to make Minnesota the epicenter of a new, renewable energy economy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil, to restore our standing in the world and put people to work here at home. To those Minnesotans who worked for me, volunteered for me, voted for me, I can't tell you how grateful I am. When you win an election this close, you know that not one bit of effort went to waste. And to those who devoted their time and energy to supporting Senator Coleman, I can only imagine how hard these past months have been. But no matter whether you voted for me or for Senator Coleman or for Senator Barkley or whether you voted at all, I want the people of Minnesota to know that I'm ready to work for all of you, that I'm committed to being a voice for all Minnesotans in the U.S. Senate. I know there's been a lot of talk about the fact that when I'm sworn in, I'll be the 60th member of the Democratic Caucus. But that's -- that's not how I see it. The way I see it, I'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic senator, I'm going to Washington to be the second senator from the State of Minnesota. And that's how I'm going to do this job.\nMALVEAUX: Minnesota's new senator, Al Franken, saying he is ready to go to work for his state. I want to bring in own Gloria Borger to kind of give us a lay of the land here. Obviously, it's a race that everybody has been following for quite some time. This is the next step now. What -- what does this mean for -- for the Democrats now that they have a larger majority?\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it means that they've got 60 seats, which would give them a filibuster-proof majority. But that's assuming that Democrats, and two Independents who we include in that, would agree on everything which is, of course, a large assumption that is not necessarily true.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: But, of course, they'll take every vote they can get at this point. Don't forget, this has been a hotly contested fight over these last eight months -- very divisive, splitting the parties in the Senate, leaving the State of Minnesota unrepresented. And so I think that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are kind of breathing a sigh of relief that it's -- that it's finally over, no matter how it was decided.\nMALVEAUX: Do you think it helps the Obama administration and the president pushing forward some of the things that have been so difficult for him, whether it's energy or health care?\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: Obviously...\nBORGER: Yes. Sure. I think it does. I mean, look, a vote is a vote is a vote. And I think Al Franken's politics are clearly more on the liberal side. So he would be more likely to go along with Barack Obama on things like climate change, on things like health care reform, than somebody like Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who's much more of a moderate who he may lose on certain votes.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: So I think that they would look at Franken as much more dependable.\nMALVEAUX: OK. Gloria Borger making sense of all of this. Thank you so much.\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: One of Michael Jackson's prized acquisitions was the rights to a vast Beatles music library.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Ken Rogoff, a Harvard economist, believes that currency uncertainty is a major issue for Scotland in the event of a \"yes\" vote for independence.", "reference_documents": ["BERMAN: Tensions building in Scotland this morning and much of the United Kingdom as voters get ready for an historic vote on whether to split from the rest of the United Kingdom. Tomorrow's vote could see Scots declare independence, potentially splitting up Great Britain after 300 years. Now, some U.K. officials in Britain are pledging to give Scots new powers in an effort to sway a vote against independence. I want go to Max Foster right now who has the latest from Edinburgh. And, Max, these polls are so, so close.\nMAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, three out today, John, and they're all too close to call. And you can really tell the story here from Edinburgh, by looking at the front pages of the newspapers. So, one of the polls on “Scotsmen“ saying the polls has “no“ in the land. But actually the “yes“ campaign is closing the gap. And “The Herald“, the only newspaper in Scotland supporting the “yes“ campaign, is making the point that yes the pro-independent campaign is closing the gap and has the momentum and could overtake no by tomorrow. That's the suggestion, at least. Very clear on the front of “The Daily Mail“, 24 hours to save Britain or to go independent. It really is a date with destiny tomorrow. We talked a bit about how there's a lot of attention to the run-up to tomorrow's poll. You know, this has been two years of campaigning and a lot of aggression, particularly on the yes side. And a very simple message here, keep the heat and carry on. That's the Scottish play on keep calm and carry campaigning, and to keep things calm really, because it is pretty tense here at the moment.\nBERMAN: Max, I think we have about a thousand questions here in the United States for you about this referendum. Can't possibly ask them all the time we have. But let me ask one that I think is surprising to many Americans. Scots want independence, they want to break away. But they want to keep the queen. They want to keep the monarchy. It seems as if they don't quite under this independence thing.\nFOSTER: I think this is a huge thing for the queen. I mean, she only came close to commenting. She can't get involved in politics. You know, she has to stay above politics. That's her constitutional rule. But she did say to a churchgoer recently she really hope that Scots consider this. You can imagine there was a very big British empire. Empires come and go. And the empire's really been cut back, of course. But now, you're talking about home turf, and her home state being split. I think she's pretty concerned about this. We have to say, in all essence, we're not talking about a big change in her role in Scotland, because the yes campaign they do want to keep her as head of state. But I certainly think that she's concerned about what's happening here. A breakup of the U.K., it's a huge moment in British history.\nBERMAN: It would be colossal, after more than 300 years, that vote is tomorrow. If they do vote to split, it would take 18 months to implement. Max Foster, great to have you here for us this morning. Thanks so much.\nROMANS: Big questions before the referendum of what a yes vote could mean for both economies. Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told me there are a lot of unknowns, the biggest being currency.\nKENNETH ROGOFF, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: When you got through with this divorce, suddenly you don't have the currency. What currency do you have? That's one of the first questions people will have, it's one of the first questions investors have. You really don't have an answer. They say it's the pound. The British say it's not the pound. People say, well, maybe Scotland will join the euro. That creates a lot of problems for the rest of the eurozone. And they could have their own currency, but that's not a magic elixir when you don't have long credibility.\nROMANS: It's a really big deal. Rogoff also said a yes vote could be -- maybe good for Scotland in the long run, he said like in a hundred years. But it's the short term uncertainly that is so concerning about this. He said, basically, it would be a mild negative for the U.K. and very big -- very big negative for Scotland. He also said, look, when Americans say why does this matter to me? I've heard this, why do I care? He says, because the U.K. and U.S. have the strongest alliance in the world. And this is our best friend breaking apart. It's a very big deal.\nBERMAN: It has huge implications for international relations as well. Again, what do you do to every other separatist movement in the world?\nROMANS: To say nothing of America's nuclear position in northern Europe, it's in Scotland.\nBERMAN: Fascinating. It will all be decided tomorrow. Twenty-seven minutes after the hour. Could U.S. troops end up fighting on the ground against ISIS?

Herman Cain, who has had a nightly talk show on the same radio station, will take over Boortz's morning slot on January 21st. That's inauguration day. Here's how Boortz put it.\nNEAL BOORTZ: If it's Barack Obama, then I'm going to disappear into the mountains somewhere and come out after he has completely destroyed this country.

How many wives? There were three. Ivanna, they had three children together. Then, of course, there was Marla Maples, the other woman. They had a daughter. And the last, he's currently married to Milania Trump. They have a son together. Now to the mogul's political aspirations - Trump is scheduled to speak at this Tea Party rally in Boca Raton, Florida. He'll bring his comments to you. Trump is considering running for president. He's expected to make a final decision by June. Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak may be on the move. An army spokesman tells CNN Mubarak was transferred from a hospital in Sharm el Sheikh to a military facility in Cairo. Several riot police standing guard outside the hospital say Mubarak is still there. The former president is under investigation for the deaths of protesters during the recent uprising. Government forces are pounding Libya's third largest city with rockets. Rebels say Gadhafi troops shelled a neighborhood, killing three people. It comes one day after a human rights group claims government forces fired cluster bombs into civilian areas. And at least five NATO service members and four Afghan soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. The bomber was wearing an Afghan national army uniform. In Cuba this weekend, it's national celebration and an important gathering of the communist government. CNN's Shasta Darlington was in Havana today, and you had watched this huge military parade 50 years after the invasion of the Bay of Pigs, really interesting historically.\nSHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Deb. This was a massive celebration of Cuba's past victories. We saw tanks rumbling through revolution plaza, tighter jets flying overhead. Thousands of troops and civilians, people from the neighborhoods coming out and marching in support of their revolution and in celebration of these major victories. It was 50 years ago this small Caribbean island defeated a U.S.-backed invasion of the Bay of Pigs. It was led by Cuban exiles, but it was really considered a defeat for Washington. They failed to provide air support. And of course Cubans never rose up and joined in the fight. A major victory, of course, for Cuba. This afternoon we'll see, as you mentioned, he was going to start looking for the future. The leaders will meet behind closed doors for a four-day meeting of the communist party. In fact, it's the first Congress of the communist party in nearly 14 years. They're going to focus on the economy and needed reforms there. President Raul Castro has called for more private enterprise and less of a role from the state. They want to do major layoffs in the state sector and allow more people to get into business for themselves in things like plumbing, gardening, opening up restaurants. They'll also talk property ownership, which could mean Cubans for the first time in decades could buy and sell homes and possibly even all those old cars could be affected if they allow Cubans to buy and sell more modern vehicles, Deb.\nFEYERICK: Shasta, I read something like 170,000 Cubans have actually taken out licenses to open their own business. Very quickly, why 14 years? Are communists coming from elsewhere? Is this an internal meeting of the leaders there in Cuba?\nDARLINGTON: Deb, it's a good question. They should be holding these meetings every five years. We haven't had one since 1997. Part of the disruption was, of course, when Fidel Castro fell ill, there was the transition from one government to another. Then massive hurricanes sort of hit the economy, global crisis, lots of different reasons. But they couldn't wait any longer. This is probably the first Congress solely dedicated to economic reform and the time is right. They knew they had to do something, and president Raul Castro has already called for many of these reforms. They're hoping to get even more done once they ever got the leaders together.\nFEYERICK: We will be keeping an eye on it, Shasta Darlington in Cuba. Thank you so much.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "President Obama launched the Educate to Innovate Campaign, a nationwide effort to improve science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education in the United States.", "reference_documents": ["HARRIS: And President Obama in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building now highlighting several initiatives this morning to boost science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... and Secretary Steven Chu, who is our energy secretary. They are both doing outstanding work each and every day. I want to acknowledge Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who is from Texas. And she is one of the members of our Science and Technology Committee and doing outstanding work. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden is in the house. Where's Charlie?\nOBAMA: And that leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our students today, especially in those fields that hold the promise of producing future innovations and innovators. And that's why education in math and science is so important. Now, the hard truth is that for decades we've been losing ground. One assessment shows American 15-year-olds now rank 21st in science and 25th in math when compared to their peers around their world. And this isn't news. We've seen warring statistics like this for years. Yet, time and again, we've let partisan and petty bickering stand in the way of progress. And time and again as a nation, we've let our children down. So I'm here and you are here because we all believe that we can't allow division and indifference to imperil our position in the world. It's time for all of us in Washington and across America to take responsibility for our future. And that's why I'm committed to moving our country from the middle to the top of the pack in science and math education over the next decade. To meet the goal, the Recovery Act included the largest investment in education in history, while preventing hundreds of thousands of educators from being fired because of state budget shortfalls. Under the outstanding leadership of Arne Duncan, we've launched a $4 billion Race to the Top fund, one of the largest investments in education reform in history. And through the Race to the Top, states won't just be receiving funding; they'll have to compete for funding. And in this competition, producing the most innovative programs in math and science will be an advantage. In addition, we are challenging states to improve achievement by raising standards, using data to better inform decisions and take new approaches to turn around struggling schools. And because a great teacher is the single most important factor in a great education, we're asking states to focus on teacher effectiveness and to make it possible for professionals, like many of the people in this room, to bring their experience and enthusiasm into the classroom. But you are here because you know that the success we seek is not going to be attained by government alone. It depends on the dedication of students and parents and the commitment of private citizens, organizations and companies. It depends on all of us. And that's why, back in April, at the National Academy of Sciences, I issued a challenge: to encourage folks to think of new and creative ways of engaging young people in science and engineering. And we are here because the leaders in this room answered that call to action. Today we are launching the Educate to Innovate Campaign, a nationwide effort to help reach the goal this administration has set: moving to the top in science and math education in the next decade. We've got leaders from private companies and universities, foundations and nonprofits and organizations representing millions of scientists, engineers and teachers from across America.\nOBAMA: The initial commitment of the private sector to this campaign is more than $260 million, and we only expect the campaign to grow. Business leaders from Intel, Xerox, Kodak and Time Warner Cable are teaming up with Sally Ride and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as the Carnegie Corporation, to find and replicate successful science, math and technology programs all across America. “Sesame Street“ has become a two-year initiative to teach young kids about math and science, and Discovery Communications is going to deliver interactive science content to 60,000 schools, reaching 35 million students. These efforts extend beyond the classroom. Time Warner Cable is joining with the Coalition for Science After School and FIRST Robotics, the program created by inventor Dean Kamen, which gave us the Cougar Cannon to connect 1 million students with fun after-school activities like robotics competitions. The MacArthur Foundation and industry leaders like Sony are launching a nationwide challenge to design compelling, freely available science-related video games. And organizations representing teachers, scientists, mathematicians and engineers, joined by volunteers in the community, are participating in a grassroots effort called National Lab Day to reach 10 million young people with hands-on learning. Students will launch rockets, construct miniature windmills and get their hands dirty. They'll have the chance to build and create, and maybe destroy just a little bit...\nOBAMA: Now, I have to say to the young people who are here, we can't let students off the hook. In the end, the success of this campaign depends on them. But I believe strongly that America's young people will rise to the challenge if given the opportunity, and given a little bit of a push. We've got to work together to create these opportunities because our future depends on them. And I just want to mention the importance not only for students but also of parents. You know, I was in Asia, I think, many of you are aware, for a week. And I was having lunch with the president of South Korea, President Lee. And I was interested in the education policy -- they've grown enormously over the last 40 years -- and I asked them what are the biggest challenges in your education policy. He said, you know, “The biggest challenge that I have is that my parents are too demanding.“"], "label": "S", "category": "TofuEval-MediaS", "additional_info": ""}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "In 2000, a man survived a 7.5 hour flight from Tahiti to LA in a plane's wheel well.", "reference_documents": ["MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to NEW DAY. Medical professionals remain shocked that a 15-year-old boy can survive a 5- 1/2 hour flight from California all the way to Hawaii in the wheel well of a Boeing 767. Although it is very rare, the teen would not be the first to live through this kind of journey. Back in 2000, a man survived a 7-1/2-hour flight from Tahiti to Los Angeles in the wheel well of a plane. Joining me now is the very physician who successfully treated that stowaway, Dr. Armand Dorian. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to have you here. Why don't you describe to us the condition of the stowaway survivor that presented to you in the E.R. back in 2000?\nDR. ARMAND DORIAN, USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL: Back in 2000, the patient that rolled in by paramedics was not in the same state as this young boy this year. He was literally frozen, almost cartoonishly frozen. His arms were kind of jutted out. He was moaning. He was unconscious. He was not alert. We had to do multiple critical measures to keep him alive. His core body temperature was below 80 degrees. We had to intubate him, put chest tubes in. It was really touch and go.\nPEREIRA: It was really a miracle that he survived in your estimation?\nDORIAN: There's no question. I thought in my lifetime I would never even hear of another case like this, let alone hear of a case where the gentleman who was a stowaway walks away from the incident.\nPEREIRA: Let's get to that. You already compared the difference between that. Quickly, before we move on, do you know if that man had lasting side effects? Oftentimes you don't know the results many years later. Do you know?\nDORIAN: Actually he had no gross motor dysfunction, so something may actually be -- later on that may come up like depression, chronic headaches, but nothing obvious at the time when he was discharged from the hospital. Know that it was a month after he was admitted.\nPEREIRA: Interesting. OK, to this 15-year-old, he essentially after an hour after the plane landed sort of came out of the wheel well mostly able to move on his own power. This is phenomenal. Talk to me about what you think happened that this young man would present in a very different condition than the man in 2000.\nDORIAN: I mean, the planets all were aligned. This was a perfect storm of disaster that actually probably saved his life because when the airplane ascends, you lose oxygen, the air gets thin as we would say in layman's terms. You would pass out in about a minute after being up there. Also, the temperature drops. With the temperature dropping it actually starts slowing down your body's need for oxygen. It puts you in a frozen or some people termed it as a suspended state. Kind of like a cryogenic freezing that we've seen, you know, sci-fi or hear about in the future happening and because your demand decreases, you don't need as much oxygen. You can be suspended in time until your oxygen is replenished.\nPEREIRA: We know your patient passed out and doesn't remember a thing of his flight. We don't what this young boy remembers. We know that he did tell police that he was unconscious for a time. What do you think it feels like for all of this to go on or do we know that because most people don't have a memory of it?\nDORIAN: I'm pretty sure he's not going to have any memory or recollection of it. He's going to probably remember the adrenaline rush of trying to hide inside that wheel well, the beginning of that takeoff, and then about a minute max, 5 minutes after that takeoff he's unconscious. The next thing he remembers, he's waking up and he's landed already. Maybe he thinks he didn't take off. He passed out and is in a completely different place.\nPEREIRA: How unusual is it, Dr. Dorian, for a person to survive subzero temperatures, lack of oxygen for 5-1/2 hours and also that he didn't fall out of the landing gear.\nDORIAN: I kind of describe it as winning the lottery five times in a row. The fashion in which he did it, I would think it was a poor TV show production if they had a kid walk out of a wheel well like this. It's really mind-boggling.\nPEREIRA: The story he was telling us, he was trying to get home to Somalia to see his mother. You can imagine the heartbreak. You can imagine the concern the family has. Hopefully he'll get medical attention to deal with any issues that come up after this. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to talk to you. Some miracles stories we are talking about. Thanks for joining us from Los Angeles -- Chris.\nCUOMO: That just does not make sense. I don't know how that kid managed to not have any effects of such extreme conditions.

They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature.

U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in “Road Warriors“.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour.

The U.S. flag raised above the American embassy in Havana for the first time in 54 years. The U.S. and Cuba marking their resumption of diplomatic relations. But what happens now between the two countries? Joining me from Houston, CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, and in New York, Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, whose father Arthur Schlesinger worked in and wrote extensively about the Kennedy White House. Good to see both of you.\nDOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Thank you.\nSTEPHEN SCHLESINGER, ADJUNCT FELLOW, CENTURY FOUNDATION: Nice to see you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. So, Stephen, to you first. You know, what was that moment like for you, and did your dad ever talk about possibly seeing that kind of day, or that day happening, like what we saw yesterday?\nSCHLESINGER: I think he always wanted this day to happen. I don't think he would have realized it was going to take another 50 years. You know, it's quite remarkable. Ten presidents I believe have been in office since the embargo was instituted against Cuba. Finally, we have a president who made a breakthrough and it's a very impressive turnaround, and I think it will pay very much dividends, both with our relationship with Cuba as well as with the entire Latin American community.\nWHITFIELD: And so, Douglas, you know, this ceremony was full of symbolism, you know, from the U.S. Marines involved 54 years ago, taking the flag down, to now being the ones to help raise the flag. Apparently the cane that Secretary of State, you know, Kerry was walking on also had its significance there. How important was this moment to set a tone, so to speak, of how these two countries will be working together this day forward?\nBRINKLEY: Well, it's a very important tone-setting moment for John Kerry. It's one of the high watermarks of his tenure as secretary of state. Barack Obama will most likely get very high marks in history for kind of healing U.S.-Cuban relations. But we've got to be cautious here. Embassies can open and they can close. We had an embassy in Venezuela, in Caracas, running and then we shut it down. We'll have to see. We're not -- the friendship with the United States and Cuba is not ironclad at this juncture. There's still human rights issues. And if we ever find out that Cuba is in some ways sponsoring terrorism against the United States, things could dissolve. But for the moment, as Stephen Schlesinger said, this is a very healing moment after this many decades of the United States and Cuba at each other's throats. It looks like now a friendship is blooming.\nWHITFIELD: And blooming in what way do you see, Stephen? Because yes, unfinished business. We're still talking about, you know, an embargo that has yet to be lifted. It takes an act of Congress in order for that to happen. But what do you see next in the short term as opposed to the long term?\nSCHLESINGER: Well, I think there are going to be a series of small steps. I think Doug is quite right that -- you know, Cuba is not going to change overnight. In fact, it may not change for years. So the small steps are important. I think right now Secretary Kerry has been talking about some of them. For example, dealing with narcotics interdiction, or the environment, or issues of financial transactions or agriculture or telecommunications. All those issues are pretty straightforward and can be dealt with in a bilateral basis. But when you get into the issues of human rights, the settlement of expropriated property of Cubans and Americans, and issues of democracy, it's -- you're talking about a much longer-term situation.\nWHITFIELD: And then, Douglas, you know, just listening to the ceremony and listening to the -- whether it be the poet or even Secretary Kerry, some beautiful, you know, words that were being used. And when using language like, you know, as two peoples who are no longer enemies or rivals, but neighbors playing the Cuban national anthem first, and then later playing, you know, the U.S. national anthem. In what way do you see those as, you know, significant moves in order to really kind of thaw the ice?\nBRINKLEY: Well, I think the Cuban people and the American people have a shared rich history. And so one of the ways that the ice thawing is going to happen are cultural exchanges. Students going down to Cuba now. People going to do tourism. I went down to Cuba just to see the sight of the Bay of Pigs invasion. And went to see where Theodore Roosevelt's, you know, history down there. It's an amazing place, Havana. So I think the influx of American tourists going to Cuba is going to be quite remarkable. And when people start talking and dialoguing, sharing music, food, it's a chance for these two countries to get much closer. And also Fidel Castro is on his last legs, so to speak. And Raul Castro has shown more of an -- shown signs that he liked to get along with the United States. So for some people that remember the Cuban missile crisis, this is really a moment to celebrate when tensions are at an all-time low right now.\nWHITFIELD: Yes, neither of the Castros were there, but, you know, their aura, indeed.\nWHITFIELD: You know, is certainly in the vicinity.\nBRINKLEY: Yes.\nWHITFIELD: Stephen Schlesinger and Douglas Brinkley, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.\nBRINKLEY: Thanks.\nSCHLESINGER: Thank you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. We'll be right back."], "label": "S", "category": "TofuEval-MediaS", "additional_info": ""}

The International Olympic Committee has elected Jacques Rogge of Belgium to an eight-year term, replacing Juan Antonio Samaranch, of Spain. The two met with reporters in Moscow, including our Patrick Snell, who's there.\nPATRICK SNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Colleen, that's right: the Samaranch era has officially come to an end after 21 years. Now all eyes will be focusing on the 59-year old orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, Jacques Rogge. Out of all the candidates, in terms of sporting politics, he was perhaps the man with the least experience -- but his very, very widespread reputation is of being a smooth diplomat; an IOC problem solver, if you like; and a man widely credited with organizing the phenomenally successful Sydney, Australia, Games last year. Rogge has a great sporting background himself. He competed in the '68, '72, and '76 Olympic Games, as a sailor, and also played rugby for his country, and is today happy to share center stage with the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch -- and a really lovely touch when he presented Samaranch himself with an Olympic Gold Medal for his own achievements. Absolutely typical of the man -- smooth talking -- and a very, very popular decision. Now a word about the rivals he beat. Rogge in the second round of voting, he won. He totaled 59 votes. That was well clear of his closest rival, the South Korean politician Un-yong Kim, who got 23 votes. That's one clear of the Canadian lawyer, Dick Pound. So the new IOC president, the Belgian Jacques Rogge -- Colleen.\nMCEDWARDS: All right, thanks very much, Patrick.\nBRIAN NELSON, CNN ANCHOR: And our next guest is Melinda McKay. She's the senior vice president of a company called Jones Lang LaSalle. This is a firm that did an Olympic study on the long-term impact that cities who've received the Olympic Games are able to benefit from. And they've gone back and studied Sydney, Atlanta, Barcelona, and Seoul. So we now introduce Melinda McKay. Let's talk about Beijing. First of all, thank you for being with us, Ms. McKay. Why the study and who paid for it -- very quickly.\nMELINDA MCKAY, JONES LANG LASALLE: The study was done based on the fact that I was actually in Sydney last year, and I was seeing firsthand what was happening in the markets, the sort of infrastructure developments that were occurring and I thought it would be very interesting for our clients to actually take a look at what happened in past host cities and see if there were any consistencies across that.\nNELSON: Summarize what you found.\nMCKAY: We found that although there are certainly short-term economic gains to be had from the Olympics -- between $3 billion and $17 billion, depending on which of the past four host cities you look at. But really, the long-term legacy is in the change to the urban form of the city. At least the past four Olympic host cities have really used the Games to revitalize rundown urban areas.\nNELSON: All right and what would be the biggest example you'd like to point to?\nMCKAY: I would take the Sydney experience, because as I said before, I was seeing it first hand. They essentially turned the Olympic Village from a munitions dump -- it was an unusable industrial front -- into the world's most environmentally friendly suburb. And if you take the Atlanta example, they spent $1 billion on capital works as a result of the Games and have revitalized the downtown area.\nNELSON: In Atlanta, there was a change, in a sense, to the infrastructure around the Centennial Park, which was created to honor the Olympics. But by and large, some people may question whether all of this was worth the millions and millions -- or maybe I should say billions of dollars -- that are poured into getting the Olympic Games. Does it really balance out?\nMCKAY: I really do think it does, if you just take a pure look at the net economic gain that is measured from the Olympic Games -- and it, as I said before, ranges between $3 billion and $17 billion, and that's just the short-term gain; you've got the long-term changes to the urban form, which are just tremendous.\nNELSON: For residents of Beijing, if the city goes ahead and keeps its promises, what should residents be seeing by the year 2008 to their city?\nMCKAY: The Beijing of 2008 will definitely be significantly different from the city that we see now. Beijing is spending $12.2 billion on environmental improvements and antipollution measures. They're spending $3.7 billion on transport infrastructure. They are turning their Olympic Village -- the Olympic Green -- into a 200-acre park, and they're surrounding that by a nature park as well. So there are very exciting changes that we'll see for Beijing.\nNELSON: Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us this morning, Melinda McKay, from Jones Lang LaSalle, and we appreciate your being here.\nMCKAY: Thank you.

You're out of the house. Your baby needs a diaper change, and you can't find a bathroom with a changing table. You've probably resorted to a public diaper changing. It's a little awkward for everyone involved. But when the person who needs that diaper change is a disabled or elderly adult, it can be worse than awkward.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Around the country, there are a handful of places that have installed private family restrooms equipped with adult changing tables. The airports in Phoenix, Baltimore and Orlando are a few. Sabrina Kimball of Tallahassee would like to see many more of them. She founded a group called Universal Changing Places and now joins us on the program. Welcome.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, thank you so much for having me.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'd like you to tell us the story of how you encountered this problem with your teenage son, Greyson, who had bacterial meningitis, I guess, as a very small child.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, Greyson contracted bacterial meningitis when he was a baby. He was premature. And he developed it when he was 10 days old. And unfortunately, it caused a lot of developmental delays and cerebral palsy. So Greyson is non-ambulatory. He's now 19, and he weighs about almost 75 pounds. And this has become a big challenge for us as we go out in public to try to include him in different activities.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: There is no safe clean place to change him. He has out - he outgrew the baby changing tables years ago. And what we're advocating for are powered height-adjustable adult changing tables to be added to family restrooms in different venues so that people have a safe clean place, and they're not resorting to either leaving the venue or laying their loved one on a public restroom floor.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: In the absence of such facilities, what do you do? What happens?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Mainly I leave. If I can't find - like if I'm at a mall, I will look in dressing rooms and try to see if there might be a bench that we might awkwardly do a seat cover change, but most of the time we leave, you know, unless it's a major accident. And then, you know, we have had to take out our pad and try to do something on a floor, which is, you know, not something I enjoy doing at all.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: You spoke of a seat cover change.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: (Laughter) Oh, I'm sorry. That is my nickname. As Greyson's gotten older, instead of saying a diaper change, I call them seat covers. It just sounded better because he's older.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: What are you hoping to see? What would be a reasonable public response to this problem.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: What we're hoping to see is that more and more venues like our hospitals, our malls, our rest areas, our airports will add these to their family restrooms so that you do have this facility to change somebody. It seems like such a simple thing, but it's a major thing for people that have older adults that are non-ambulatory or have self-care issues.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: It would seem to me this eliminates both a terrible physical inconvenience you'd be posed with but also some embarrassment, I should think that it addresses.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes. But also, it's an area of dignity for that person, too. I mean, how many people if you have an accident like that want to have to stay in that until they get home because there is no place to change them?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: And I talked to a gentleman when I first started my campaign. He is a quadriplegic. And the one thing he mentioned to me when I first told him about what I was doing, he said, you don't want to know how many bathroom floors I've laid on in my life. And I was like - it just broke my heart. I'm thinking this is not right. This is something we can do something about.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: That is Sabrina Kimball speaking to us via Skype from Tallahassee.

The television icon, “Jeopardy!“ host Alex Trebek, he's hosted that show for nearly 35 years. Announcing in public, with a video, that he's been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer.\nHARLOW: He is 78 years old, and he posted this moving message to fans on Wednesday, saying he will fight this.\nALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY!: I'm going to fight this. And I'm going to keep working. And with the love and support of my family and friends, and with the help of your prayers, also, I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease. Truth told? I have to. Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host “Jeopardy!“ for three more years, so help me.\nHARLOW: Oh. We all want to help him. With us now is our senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. He's such a staple in so many American households, living rooms, every evening. But you look at the numbers, you know? I think a statistic I read, 95 percent of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer die. Why?\nELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. I mean, the numbers really are so sobering. So, Poppy, what that number is, is that if you look at people with pancreatic cancer that's stage IV, so advanced cancer that's spread to distant parts of the body, five years after that diagnosis, only three percent of them are still alive. Those are not great numbers. Now, the American Cancer Society makes a point of saying, “Look, this -- you can't predict what's going to happen to any one person.“ And so obviously we are all praying and wishing Alex Trebek the best. But those are sort of the average, the average statistics that talk about what typically happens.\nSCIUTTO: Now, there are folks who survive. And some famous folks who survive, RBG survived pancreatic cancer. And those are hopeful stories, but you don't want it to give undue hope. What are the treatment options that make that more likely?\nCOHEN: Right. So, Jim, what they really try to focus on is chemotherapy for this disease. And doctors are very clear, they're not thinking about curing it at this stage. Really, what they're thinking of is slowing the progression and keeping the patient as comfortable as possible.\nTEXT: Pancreatic Cancer: Most patients are older than 45; Nearly 90 percent are older than 55; Average age of diagnosis is 71\nCOHEN: So mainly, that's chemotherapy. Some patients do get surgery. But it's not the kind of surgery that we hear of, for example, for a lump in a woman's breast, where you're hoping to remove all of it. They don't usually remove all of it because by the time pancreatic cancer is diagnosed, typically is has spread pretty far and it's really impossible to remove all of it.\nHARLOW: So it would all -- I mean, as you noted, the key reason here, why it's so deadly is because of the lack of symptoms, right? It's not like some of the other cancers where you have these symptoms. So it's almost as though if there were something to make it more symptomatic, it would be so helpful.\nCOHEN: Right. It actually would be better, ironically, if people felt sick. But people often don't feel sick at the beginning stages, or at the stage where pancreatic cancer is diagnosed.\nTEXT: Pancreatic Cancer in the\nU.S.: Fourth leading cause of death from cancer; Around 56,770 new cases will be diagnosed this year; Estimated 45,750 people will die from this cancer this year\nCOHEN: So they have pancreatic cancer, it's spread, but they often feel OK. And so the first signs are often things like jaundice or unexplained weight loss, or, oddly enough, itching is also another sign. But, you know, by the time these signs show up, usually the pancreatic cancer has spread. And there are some other reasons why it's so difficult to treat this disease, and why it is so deadly. One of them is that the pancreas is, it's way in there. It is deep in the middle of your abdomen. The organ itself doesn't have any kind of capsule around it, so it really spreads quite quickly.\nHARLOW: Elizabeth Cohen, thank you for reporting --\nCOHEN: Thanks.\nHARLOW: -- this. Alex Trebek, with his humor always, right? We're thinking of you. The Republican-controlled Senate is set to hold a hearing on gun control. This is a big deal.

Other news we're following, dozens of Palestinians were killed today during protests in Gaza along the border with Israel. The demonstrations were aimed at the United States' opening a new embassy in Jerusalem, moving the new embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations says today's violence means there's no chance at peace. Let's get perspective from the Palestinians right now. Joining us, Ambassador Husam Zomlot. He's the head of the Palestinian authorities' delegation to the United States. Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much for joining us. Give us immediate reaction, if you can, to what the latest developments are, the impact of the U.S. moving the embassy, and what it means for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?\nAMB. HUSAM ZOMLOT, DIRECTOR, PLO DELEGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES: Just the U.S. administration has gave up on the peace process and its role as a mediator international towards achieving the internationally endorsed two-state solution. And it also means the U.S. has gave in for the voices of extremism, for the voices we'll see a zero-sum game, the fanatics, politically speaking. It was telling today that the ones who opened the ceremony of moving the U.S. embassy are religious leaders of the Christian Zionists who interpret politics and legality and world map from a very contested, to say the least, religious implications. This is not only encouraging Israel to cross the line. It's very encouraging to Israel to cross the line towards Armageddon and the end-of-time prophecy.\nBLITZER: Ambassador, are you at all, Mr. Ambassador, in touch with Trump administration officials? They keep saying they're about to release their peace plan, Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, and they still have hope for the two-state solution, Israel alongside a new state of Palestine. Have you had conversations with these American officials?\nZOMLOT: We don't know what they're talking about, really. We don't know. Peace is a very firm vision by the U.S. That vision has been drawn by all previous administrations, with the 1968 borders, establishing a sovereign state with each in the U.S. capital. The U.S. law is very clear. It was presented in 1991 by former administrator, James Baker. It is very clear. The U.S. intervention and vision is about Israel's occupation, implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions and respecting them in Jerusalem, never recognizing Israel's control of annexations. So what the U.S. administration has done is reneging on these promises and violating international law. There is a U.N. Security Council resolution that the U.S. voted for and that presents any state from moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And also the U.S. has stated that Jerusalem is outside the negotiating table. You know it, Wolf, very well. You have been there for many decades. But Jerusalem is the heart of the two states solution --\nBLITZER: Let me just interrupt, Ambassador, because they say they're not necessarily concluding all final status of all parts of Jerusalem. Yes, the U.S. is moving the embassy to west Jerusalem, but they're not completely ruling out the possibility of the Palestinians having control of parts of east Jerusalem and having a U.S. embassy in east Jerusalem for the new Palestinian state. When you hear that from the administration, what do you think?\nZOMLOT: No, I only have it from you now. Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people. It's not even the capital of Israel. As I said earlier, a clear religious interpretation of international relations and legal matters on one hand. On the other hand, there was a reason why all previous American presidents, from President Truman to President Obama, why they decided not to move the embassy. They knew, by doing so, you actually remove the U.S. from the role of the mediator and dictate the terms of reference and dictate the outcome of Jerusalem being an issue. Of course, we would be fine if the U.S. has -- when there are two embassies after reaching a peace agreement. Before that, it is -- it will only be seen as urgent on the Palestinians. President Trump himself says removing the Jerusalem from the table, taking it off the table. And then they wanted to remove the administration off the table that services the refugees. And then they are not even criticizing or condemning the illegal settlement expansion, which has been the major obstacle on the part of the two-state solution. And they are not even criticizing or condemning the murder by Israeli forces of the Palestinian peaceful demonstrators. So the bottom line, what peace process this administration is talking about? We believe that peace --\nZOMLOT: -- can be found now in the international community, in a multilateral forum. Peace can only be found based on legality, based on politics, not based on ideology, and some very twisted religious interpretations of reality.\nBLITZER: Ambassador Zomlot, let's see what this -- if they do release a plan, the Trump administration, what specifically it spells out. We'll continue our conversations. Ambassador Zomlot, thanks so much for joining us.\nZOMLOT: Thank you.\nBLITZER: We're going to hear from the White House about these deadly protests in Gaza, along the border with Israel in a few minutes.

But in a statement, Lady Gaga posted on Twitter, she explains this, in part, “What I am hearing about the allegations against R. Kelly is absolutely horrifying and indefensible. As a victim of sexual assault myself, I made both the song and video in a dark time in my life. I intend to remove this song off of iTunes and other streaming platforms and will not be working with him again.“ “Rolling Stone“ reports that at least two Dallas radio stations have banned his music from their air waves. Meanwhile, R. Kelly was spotted and videotaped last night inside a Chicago nightclub with a message for a crowd.\nR. KELLY, SINGER: There's something that I must confess you all\nKEILAR: While Kelly was in that club, there were several protesters rallying outside his Chicago studios chanting, “Mute R. Kelly.“ Joining me to discuss, we have Lola Ogunnaike, the anchor for “People TV.“ Lola, as you watch all of this, do you think this is the beginning of the end for R. Kelly?\nLOLA OGUNNAIKE, ANCHOR, PEOPLE TV: Brianna, you and I were talking off-camera, I was here 17 years ago on CNN talking about a story that I'd written for the cover of “Vibe“ magazine. It was a 6,000-word expose. I do finally feel like justice will prevail like this time of around. It's taken a number of years, well over a decade but justice will finally prevail.\nKEILAR: So this is something -- it's been on your radar for the better part of two decades. You have artists saying, I am not going to be associated with this guy. There were things that were known. What has changed?\nOGUNNAIKE: I think the world at large has changed. The “Me Too“ movement has been very instrumental in helping people redefine the way they look at relationships between men and women, men and men, inappropriate relationships in general. I think people are willing to have a conversation that they weren't willing to have as early as a year ago. The “Me Too“ movement has been extremely instrumental in helping us have a very important conversation that had been ignored and swept under the rug for the better part of two decades.\nOGUNNAIKE: I want to talk about Lady Gaga. Interestingly enough, Lady Gaga's apology went a long way, but she had a glaring omission in that apology. There was a video that was supposed to accompany this song and it was a video that was shot by famed fashion photographer, Terry Richardson. She had also been accused for more than a decade of being a sexual predator. He was accused of preying upon young girls. “Vogue“ banned him from shooting in his magazine. She worked with not one, but two sexual predators on this project. It was problematic then. She knew it. I find it interesting that now she's coming forward with her apology.\nKEILAR: What did you think of R. Kelly on just how defiant he has been, that he shows up at this club and he is singing his heart out with some support there, obviously?\nOGUNNAIKE: R. Kelly is doing what he's always done. R. Kelly in the past has always been able to get away with this behavior because he was always able to produce a hit and sing away his problems. He's at the tail end of his career. People had been muting R. Kelly for years. He's no longer at the height of his career and I do think people are now saying, I don't care what music he creates, I don't care if he's a musical genius, he has a serious problem with young women and it has to stop.\nKEILAR: Lola, thank you so much. Lola Ogunnaike, we appreciate you being with us.\nOGUNNAIKE: Thank you.\nKEILAR: I'm Brianna Keilar, live in Washington. And tomorrow, 800,000 federal workers won't get paid.

We are following breaking news this morning. It is a shocking story involving the blade runner, Olympic and Paralympic track superstar Oscar Pistorius. He is at the police station in south Africa right now after his model girlfriend was shot and killed inside his home. Police are saying a 26-year-old man has been arrested. They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature. Pistorius, who is a double amputee, reached the 400-meter semifinals in the London Games last year. He races with carbon blades because of a birth defect.\nBERMAN: To New York now where first it was calorie counts on menus, then trans fats, then mega soft drinks. Now, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is out to ban Styrofoam food packaging in stores. It's actually not Styrofoam technically, it's plastic foam. He's looking to ban that in stores and food restaurants. Bloomberg will unveil the plan today in his final State of the City speech.\nSAMBOLIN: And, boy, did you feel that breeze? Look at this. A boxer has suspended for allegedly taking a dive 13 seconds into a fight against former NFL defensive end Ray Edwards. Look at this, the phantom upper cut misses his much smaller opponent Nick “Turbo Tax“ Capes by about a foot. But he sells it, literally knocking himself off his own feet. Reports say “Turbo Tax“ --\nBERMAN: That is insane, I'm sorry. It is nowhere near him.\nSAMBOLIN: I know. But it looked right. So, if you're far away.\nBERMAN: Two miles away.\nSAMBOLIN: “Turbo Tax“ was a last-minute replacement for a couple of no-show boxers. North Dakota's fight governing body is reviewing that right there. It won't take long to jump into a conclusion dare, I say, right?\nBERMAN: Not a tough one to review. Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in “Road Warriors“.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour.

You've seen their faces. The two American journalists captured and accused of spying in North Korea. And within hours, they are set to go on trial. The sister of one of the journalists, reporter Lisa Ling from CNN's “PLANET IN PERIL“ series has pleaded for their release. Our Jason Carroll here now with what a trial in North Korea could mean. And by any stretch of the imagination, it's got to be a frightening prospect.\nJASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And this has been so -- this has been such a terrifying ordeal, not only for the two women who are involved but for the families as well. If the trial proceeds and there is a conviction, they could be looking at an independent sentence at a prison or a labor camp. One of the many problems here is so little is known about North Korea, let alone the country's legal system. What is known, a fair trial is not likely.\nCARROLL (voice-over): Trapped in one of the most isolated countries in the world, North Korea, imprisoned, accused of spying and awaiting trial. This is what American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee are facing. Their families pleading for their release saying both women are terrified.\nLISA LING, SISTER OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST: They never meant to cross into North Korea. I mean, that was never their objective. And if for some reason they may have, then we are sorry. And we hope that the North Korean government will show mercy.\nCARROLL: Lisa Ling received a surprise call from her sister last Tuesday saying she was being treated fairly. Ling who is also a journalist has reported from North Korea for “National Geographic“ and knows just how dangerous the country can be.\nLING: How does the great leader defend it against big powers like America.\nCARROLL: With his wife's trial just one day away, Laura Ling's husband said the strain has been unbearable.\nIAIN CLAYTON, HUSBAND OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST: As you can imagine, it's probably been, you know, the worst few months of my life.\nCARROLL: Both Ling and Lee are reporters for “Current TV,“ a media venture started by former Vice President Al Gore. They were reporting on North Korean defectors living along the China-North Korea border when they were taken into custody on March 17. The North Korean government claiming the two entered the country, illegally, a charge the State Department and Lisa Ling deny. In an interview on AMERICAN MORNING, former vice president says he'd even consider going to North Korea to help.\nAL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: I would do anything within reason including that at the drop of the hat. But it is -- that's not -- it's not some place that you just buy a ticket and show up at the airport.\nCARROLL: Complicating diplomacy, North Korea angered the world with recent nuclear test and missile launches. Ambassador Wendy Sherman is an expert on the region and has met the country's leader, Kim Jong-Il, and knows he will influence the trial's outcome.\nWENDY SHERMAN, FORMER NORTH KOREA POLICY COORDINATOR: He understands how important family is to each other. And so I hope that he takes that understanding and releases these two young women and returns them to their families.\nCARROLL: Victor Cha has also been to North Korea, the former director for Asian Affairs under George W. Bush says the country's legal system has little rhyme or reason.\nVICTOR CHA, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, CSIS KOREA CHAIR: I think what you would expect to see is something in between a prison sentence to, you know, perhaps even sentencing to some sort of labor camp. Hopefully, those will just be a token sort of punishment.\nCARROLL: Again, the trial is set for Thursday. Representatives from Sweden have been working behind the scenes to try to engage the North Koreans. They're looking at what happened in the '90s when an American pilot accidentally flew over the region and was taken into custody. He was released after he promised to apologize.\nROBERTS: She had this ghost coming down hours from now. Jason, thanks so much. Don't miss “AC360“ tonight, by the way.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Melinda McKay from Jones Lang LaSalle conducted a study on the long-term impact of hosting the Olympics on cities.", "reference_documents": ["COLLEEN MCEDWARDS, CNN ANCHOR: The Olympics have a new boss. The International Olympic Committee has elected Jacques Rogge of Belgium to an eight-year term, replacing Juan Antonio Samaranch, of Spain. The two met with reporters in Moscow, including our Patrick Snell, who's there.\nPATRICK SNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Colleen, that's right: the Samaranch era has officially come to an end after 21 years. Now all eyes will be focusing on the 59-year old orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, Jacques Rogge. Out of all the candidates, in terms of sporting politics, he was perhaps the man with the least experience -- but his very, very widespread reputation is of being a smooth diplomat; an IOC problem solver, if you like; and a man widely credited with organizing the phenomenally successful Sydney, Australia, Games last year. Rogge has a great sporting background himself. He competed in the '68, '72, and '76 Olympic Games, as a sailor, and also played rugby for his country, and is today happy to share center stage with the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch -- and a really lovely touch when he presented Samaranch himself with an Olympic Gold Medal for his own achievements. Absolutely typical of the man -- smooth talking -- and a very, very popular decision. Now a word about the rivals he beat. Rogge in the second round of voting, he won. He totaled 59 votes. That was well clear of his closest rival, the South Korean politician Un-yong Kim, who got 23 votes. That's one clear of the Canadian lawyer, Dick Pound. So the new IOC president, the Belgian Jacques Rogge -- Colleen.\nMCEDWARDS: All right, thanks very much, Patrick.\nBRIAN NELSON, CNN ANCHOR: And our next guest is Melinda McKay. She's the senior vice president of a company called Jones Lang LaSalle. This is a firm that did an Olympic study on the long-term impact that cities who've received the Olympic Games are able to benefit from. And they've gone back and studied Sydney, Atlanta, Barcelona, and Seoul. So we now introduce Melinda McKay. Let's talk about Beijing. First of all, thank you for being with us, Ms. McKay. Why the study and who paid for it -- very quickly.\nMELINDA MCKAY, JONES LANG LASALLE: The study was done based on the fact that I was actually in Sydney last year, and I was seeing firsthand what was happening in the markets, the sort of infrastructure developments that were occurring and I thought it would be very interesting for our clients to actually take a look at what happened in past host cities and see if there were any consistencies across that.\nNELSON: Summarize what you found.\nMCKAY: We found that although there are certainly short-term economic gains to be had from the Olympics -- between $3 billion and $17 billion, depending on which of the past four host cities you look at. But really, the long-term legacy is in the change to the urban form of the city. At least the past four Olympic host cities have really used the Games to revitalize rundown urban areas.\nNELSON: All right and what would be the biggest example you'd like to point to?\nMCKAY: I would take the Sydney experience, because as I said before, I was seeing it first hand. They essentially turned the Olympic Village from a munitions dump -- it was an unusable industrial front -- into the world's most environmentally friendly suburb. And if you take the Atlanta example, they spent $1 billion on capital works as a result of the Games and have revitalized the downtown area.\nNELSON: In Atlanta, there was a change, in a sense, to the infrastructure around the Centennial Park, which was created to honor the Olympics. But by and large, some people may question whether all of this was worth the millions and millions -- or maybe I should say billions of dollars -- that are poured into getting the Olympic Games. Does it really balance out?\nMCKAY: I really do think it does, if you just take a pure look at the net economic gain that is measured from the Olympic Games -- and it, as I said before, ranges between $3 billion and $17 billion, and that's just the short-term gain; you've got the long-term changes to the urban form, which are just tremendous.\nNELSON: For residents of Beijing, if the city goes ahead and keeps its promises, what should residents be seeing by the year 2008 to their city?\nMCKAY: The Beijing of 2008 will definitely be significantly different from the city that we see now. Beijing is spending $12.2 billion on environmental improvements and antipollution measures. They're spending $3.7 billion on transport infrastructure. They are turning their Olympic Village -- the Olympic Green -- into a 200-acre park, and they're surrounding that by a nature park as well. So there are very exciting changes that we'll see for Beijing.\nNELSON: Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us this morning, Melinda McKay, from Jones Lang LaSalle, and we appreciate your being here.\nMCKAY: Thank you.

It wasn't Demetrus.\nDOLAN: It was not him.\nBERMAN: They blew it. Someone -- either the state of the federal government blew it. And, Demetrus, this is an important point I want to get to before I bring Van in. How have you lived your life in the years since you have been released from prison?\nDEMETRIUS ANDERSON, COULD BE SENT BACK TO PRISON OVER CLERICAL ERROR: Like an American, law abiding citizen, doing everything right, working, gainfully employed, involved in my community, involved in my church -- found a church home. Just doing everything that I was supposed to do.\nBERMAN: Now, Van Jones, I want to bring you into this conversation because I think you all saw this story, like so many of us did, in the New Haven papers and in the Yale papers. You look at this and you think this runs counter to the idea of the justice, in quotation marks, system that we have in place.\nVAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I mean, absolutely. The whole point of the corrections system is to correct people. How can you say at this point 13 years later this man needs correction when he's done everything right? As best we can tell, he hasn't -- he doesn't even have an overdue library book. He's living better than me. He's living better than you. He's doing all the things you want someone to do. And if you're going to say this person, after 13 years of doing nothing wrong, of rebuilding his life, has to go back and do -- and do time, you have literally millions of other people who are out here who are supposed to do the right thing. What's to say that in five years, 10 years, 20 years, somebody's going to go back through the sock drawer and find something to put them back in jail? This doesn't make any sense. When somebody has actually rehabilitated themselves, that's the whole point. He's already done time for this crime and he should get credit for that. And he's -- he should get more credit for 13 years out of trouble. You know the statistics. When people come home from prison, the vast majority, unfortunately, wind up back in trouble very quickly. He has not been back in trouble for 13 years. The only trouble he is in now is because of a bizarre clerical error that could destroy his life.\nBERMAN: And, Van, you worked with Jared Kushner at the White House on criminal justice reform and prison reform. Do you intend to reach out personally to the White House to see if the president will get involved?\nJONES: I have already done so. And we'll see what happens. Here's the deal. I'm going to personally ask President Trump to do something. I'm going to ask everybody I know in the White House to do something. But I think everybody in America should get involved in this case. This is the kind of stuff that's so demoralizing and debilitating for people who are trying -- hey, listen, you -- let me talk about a role model. This is a guy that everybody coming out of prison hopes they will be. You don't grab your role model and throw your role models in jail. You should put your role models on your shoulders and parade them around. And so I'm going to ask, but, you know, also, cut50.org is doing something. I'm a part of the reformalliance.com. We are getting involved. Please reach out, help us make this a big issue. It's very rare, obviously, for the president to get involved in something like this, but we think the judges involved should give him credit for time served. We think the president should get involved. We think everybody should get involved.\nBERMAN: Demetrus, you have an April 4th court date.\nANDERSON: Correct.\nBERMAN: And this is very soon. You could end up back in federal prison in a week. Are you scared?\nANDERSON: I'm very scared. I'm very scared.\nBERMAN: What do you think is going to happen?\nANDERSON: I'm optimistic that justice will prevail. I still have faith in the judicial system. So I'm just praying and, you know, leaning on my faith that this could be, you know, vindicated.\nBERMAN: Well, Demetrus Anderson, Mike Dolan, thank you very much for being with us. Van, thank you for bringing this to our attention.\nANDERSON: Thank you, Van. Thank you so much.\nBERMAN: And we will follow this over the next ten days. It is a very important story. Thank you.

And when you're trying to substitute one group -- with another group, he is now offended, you're simply not winning regardless if you have very good policy that a lot of immigration activists agree with as Jeb does.\nKING: I think Mr. Trump is under the governor's skin, fair to say?\nROBERT COSTA, “THE WASHINGTON POST“: He is. I spoke to Trump yesterday. He just continues to slam Bush. And he loves it. I said are you going to stop it ever? He said, probably not and on immigration especially this has put the Republican Party in a tough position. The base loves what Trump is saying on immigration. Whether it plays in a general election, who knows?\nKING: Right, but the calendar has been changed, those southern states are going to be a lot more important this time.\nCOSTA: Even if you don't get a big bounce out of those early February caucuses and primaries, March 1st, nine states, south.\nKING: You mentioned he says he may not stop going after Governor Bush, someone needs to help me understand why he thinks it's in his benefit, to his benefit to keep going after Megyn Kelly. Megyn Kelly was on vacation. Donald Trump tweeting out last night at Megyn Kelly, “Must have had a terrible vacation. She is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration.“ That was about the “Kelly File“ last night. Later he tweets, “I like the “Kelly File“ much better without Megyn Kelly. Maybe she could take another 11-day unscheduled vacation“ so two sort of gratuitous shots at her there. What I think is a bigger problem. He then again re-tweeted a tweet where somebody called her a bimbo. He did that right after the Fox debate when he had the confrontation with her and he does it again last night. No rules apply to Donald Trump, but I cannot see how that is in his interest.\nPARKET: I was very stunned to see those tweets as well. Donald Trump is in a weird way a post Fox News candidate, a post everything candidate. The rules of traditional politics do not apply. You cannot go to war with Fox News. You try to get booked on all of their shows, right? And he's doing the exact opposite and crowd loves him for it.\nCOSTA: I was at a focus group last night of Trump supporters in Virginia and the one thing -- these were all Trump supporters, the one thing that really turned them off, Trump's comments about women. He should be paying attention to the voters. It's not acceptable if you're a presidential candidate.\nKING: Interesting point. We'll see how this plays out. Betsy Klein sent out a note saying she was talking to a Trump supporter who said, as a parent, it makes me cringe, some of the stuff he puts out on Twitter. Ashley, Robert, thanks for coming in. Alisyn, it's a very interesting. We'll see how the Jeb-Trump thing I think is going to be. We have that CNN debate coming up in just a few weeks.

I intend to remove this song off of iTunes and other streaming platforms and will not be working with him again.“ “Rolling Stone“ reports that at least two Dallas radio stations have banned his music from their air waves. Meanwhile, R. Kelly was spotted and videotaped last night inside a Chicago nightclub with a message for a crowd.\nR. KELLY, SINGER: There's something that I must confess you all\nKEILAR: While Kelly was in that club, there were several protesters rallying outside his Chicago studios chanting, “Mute R. Kelly.“ Joining me to discuss, we have Lola Ogunnaike, the anchor for “People TV.“ Lola, as you watch all of this, do you think this is the beginning of the end for R. Kelly?\nLOLA OGUNNAIKE, ANCHOR, PEOPLE TV: Brianna, you and I were talking off-camera, I was here 17 years ago on CNN talking about a story that I'd written for the cover of “Vibe“ magazine. It was a 6,000-word expose. I do finally feel like justice will prevail like this time of around. It's taken a number of years, well over a decade but justice will finally prevail.\nKEILAR: So this is something -- it's been on your radar for the better part of two decades. You have artists saying, I am not going to be associated with this guy. There were things that were known. What has changed?\nOGUNNAIKE: I think the world at large has changed. The “Me Too“ movement has been very instrumental in helping people redefine the way they look at relationships between men and women, men and men, inappropriate relationships in general. I think people are willing to have a conversation that they weren't willing to have as early as a year ago. The “Me Too“ movement has been extremely instrumental in helping us have a very important conversation that had been ignored and swept under the rug for the better part of two decades.\nOGUNNAIKE: I want to talk about Lady Gaga. Interestingly enough, Lady Gaga's apology went a long way, but she had a glaring omission in that apology. There was a video that was supposed to accompany this song and it was a video that was shot by famed fashion photographer, Terry Richardson. She had also been accused for more than a decade of being a sexual predator. He was accused of preying upon young girls. “Vogue“ banned him from shooting in his magazine. She worked with not one, but two sexual predators on this project. It was problematic then. She knew it. I find it interesting that now she's coming forward with her apology.\nKEILAR: What did you think of R. Kelly on just how defiant he has been, that he shows up at this club and he is singing his heart out with some support there, obviously?\nOGUNNAIKE: R. Kelly is doing what he's always done. R. Kelly in the past has always been able to get away with this behavior because he was always able to produce a hit and sing away his problems. He's at the tail end of his career. People had been muting R. Kelly for years. He's no longer at the height of his career and I do think people are now saying, I don't care what music he creates, I don't care if he's a musical genius, he has a serious problem with young women and it has to stop.\nKEILAR: Lola, thank you so much. Lola Ogunnaike, we appreciate you being with us.\nOGUNNAIKE: Thank you.\nKEILAR: I'm Brianna Keilar, live in Washington. And tomorrow, 800,000 federal workers won't get paid.

Announcing in public, with a video, that he's been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer.\nHARLOW: He is 78 years old, and he posted this moving message to fans on Wednesday, saying he will fight this.\nALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY!: I'm going to fight this. And I'm going to keep working. And with the love and support of my family and friends, and with the help of your prayers, also, I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease. Truth told? I have to. Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host “Jeopardy!“ for three more years, so help me.\nHARLOW: Oh. We all want to help him. With us now is our senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. He's such a staple in so many American households, living rooms, every evening. But you look at the numbers, you know? I think a statistic I read, 95 percent of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer die. Why?\nELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. I mean, the numbers really are so sobering. So, Poppy, what that number is, is that if you look at people with pancreatic cancer that's stage IV, so advanced cancer that's spread to distant parts of the body, five years after that diagnosis, only three percent of them are still alive. Those are not great numbers. Now, the American Cancer Society makes a point of saying, “Look, this -- you can't predict what's going to happen to any one person.“ And so obviously we are all praying and wishing Alex Trebek the best. But those are sort of the average, the average statistics that talk about what typically happens.\nSCIUTTO: Now, there are folks who survive. And some famous folks who survive, RBG survived pancreatic cancer. And those are hopeful stories, but you don't want it to give undue hope. What are the treatment options that make that more likely?\nCOHEN: Right. So, Jim, what they really try to focus on is chemotherapy for this disease. And doctors are very clear, they're not thinking about curing it at this stage. Really, what they're thinking of is slowing the progression and keeping the patient as comfortable as possible.\nTEXT: Pancreatic Cancer: Most patients are older than 45; Nearly 90 percent are older than 55; Average age of diagnosis is 71\nCOHEN: So mainly, that's chemotherapy. Some patients do get surgery. But it's not the kind of surgery that we hear of, for example, for a lump in a woman's breast, where you're hoping to remove all of it. They don't usually remove all of it because by the time pancreatic cancer is diagnosed, typically is has spread pretty far and it's really impossible to remove all of it.\nHARLOW: So it would all -- I mean, as you noted, the key reason here, why it's so deadly is because of the lack of symptoms, right? It's not like some of the other cancers where you have these symptoms. So it's almost as though if there were something to make it more symptomatic, it would be so helpful.\nCOHEN: Right. It actually would be better, ironically, if people felt sick. But people often don't feel sick at the beginning stages, or at the stage where pancreatic cancer is diagnosed.\nTEXT: Pancreatic Cancer in the\nU.S.: Fourth leading cause of death from cancer; Around 56,770 new cases will be diagnosed this year; Estimated 45,750 people will die from this cancer this year\nCOHEN: So they have pancreatic cancer, it's spread, but they often feel OK. And so the first signs are often things like jaundice or unexplained weight loss, or, oddly enough, itching is also another sign. But, you know, by the time these signs show up, usually the pancreatic cancer has spread. And there are some other reasons why it's so difficult to treat this disease, and why it is so deadly. One of them is that the pancreas is, it's way in there. It is deep in the middle of your abdomen. The organ itself doesn't have any kind of capsule around it, so it really spreads quite quickly.\nHARLOW: Elizabeth Cohen, thank you for reporting --\nCOHEN: Thanks.\nHARLOW: -- this.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The provided CNN transcript discusses the historic raising of the U.S. flag over the American embassy in Havana, signaling the resumption of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba.", "reference_documents": ["WHITFIELD: All right. The U.S. flag raised above the American embassy in Havana for the first time in 54 years. The U.S. and Cuba marking their resumption of diplomatic relations. But what happens now between the two countries? Joining me from Houston, CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, and in New York, Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, whose father Arthur Schlesinger worked in and wrote extensively about the Kennedy White House. Good to see both of you.\nDOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Thank you.\nSTEPHEN SCHLESINGER, ADJUNCT FELLOW, CENTURY FOUNDATION: Nice to see you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. So, Stephen, to you first. You know, what was that moment like for you, and did your dad ever talk about possibly seeing that kind of day, or that day happening, like what we saw yesterday?\nSCHLESINGER: I think he always wanted this day to happen. I don't think he would have realized it was going to take another 50 years. You know, it's quite remarkable. Ten presidents I believe have been in office since the embargo was instituted against Cuba. Finally, we have a president who made a breakthrough and it's a very impressive turnaround, and I think it will pay very much dividends, both with our relationship with Cuba as well as with the entire Latin American community.\nWHITFIELD: And so, Douglas, you know, this ceremony was full of symbolism, you know, from the U.S. Marines involved 54 years ago, taking the flag down, to now being the ones to help raise the flag. Apparently the cane that Secretary of State, you know, Kerry was walking on also had its significance there. How important was this moment to set a tone, so to speak, of how these two countries will be working together this day forward?\nBRINKLEY: Well, it's a very important tone-setting moment for John Kerry. It's one of the high watermarks of his tenure as secretary of state. Barack Obama will most likely get very high marks in history for kind of healing U.S.-Cuban relations. But we've got to be cautious here. Embassies can open and they can close. We had an embassy in Venezuela, in Caracas, running and then we shut it down. We'll have to see. We're not -- the friendship with the United States and Cuba is not ironclad at this juncture. There's still human rights issues. And if we ever find out that Cuba is in some ways sponsoring terrorism against the United States, things could dissolve. But for the moment, as Stephen Schlesinger said, this is a very healing moment after this many decades of the United States and Cuba at each other's throats. It looks like now a friendship is blooming.\nWHITFIELD: And blooming in what way do you see, Stephen? Because yes, unfinished business. We're still talking about, you know, an embargo that has yet to be lifted. It takes an act of Congress in order for that to happen. But what do you see next in the short term as opposed to the long term?\nSCHLESINGER: Well, I think there are going to be a series of small steps. I think Doug is quite right that -- you know, Cuba is not going to change overnight. In fact, it may not change for years. So the small steps are important. I think right now Secretary Kerry has been talking about some of them. For example, dealing with narcotics interdiction, or the environment, or issues of financial transactions or agriculture or telecommunications. All those issues are pretty straightforward and can be dealt with in a bilateral basis. But when you get into the issues of human rights, the settlement of expropriated property of Cubans and Americans, and issues of democracy, it's -- you're talking about a much longer-term situation.\nWHITFIELD: And then, Douglas, you know, just listening to the ceremony and listening to the -- whether it be the poet or even Secretary Kerry, some beautiful, you know, words that were being used. And when using language like, you know, as two peoples who are no longer enemies or rivals, but neighbors playing the Cuban national anthem first, and then later playing, you know, the U.S. national anthem. In what way do you see those as, you know, significant moves in order to really kind of thaw the ice?\nBRINKLEY: Well, I think the Cuban people and the American people have a shared rich history. And so one of the ways that the ice thawing is going to happen are cultural exchanges. Students going down to Cuba now. People going to do tourism. I went down to Cuba just to see the sight of the Bay of Pigs invasion. And went to see where Theodore Roosevelt's, you know, history down there. It's an amazing place, Havana. So I think the influx of American tourists going to Cuba is going to be quite remarkable. And when people start talking and dialoguing, sharing music, food, it's a chance for these two countries to get much closer. And also Fidel Castro is on his last legs, so to speak. And Raul Castro has shown more of an -- shown signs that he liked to get along with the United States. So for some people that remember the Cuban missile crisis, this is really a moment to celebrate when tensions are at an all-time low right now.\nWHITFIELD: Yes, neither of the Castros were there, but, you know, their aura, indeed.\nWHITFIELD: You know, is certainly in the vicinity.\nBRINKLEY: Yes.\nWHITFIELD: Stephen Schlesinger and Douglas Brinkley, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.\nBRINKLEY: Thanks.\nSCHLESINGER: Thank you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. We'll be right back."], "label": "S", "category": "TofuEval-MediaS", "additional_info": ""}

He is Minnesota's new senator -- that declared today, after a very long and contentious race. Let's take a quick listen to Al Franken at the mike.\nAL FRANKEN, WINNER OF MINNESOTA SENATE RACE: I'm thrilled and honored by the faith that Minnesotans have placed in me. I'm also humbled, not just by the closeness of this election, but by the enormity of the responsibility that comes with this office. We have a lot of work to do in Washington, but that's why I signed up for the job in the first place. When we started this campaign way back in February of 2007, I said that Americans have never backed away from tough challenges and Minnesotans have always led the way. Working with our fantastic senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to fight hard to make quality health care accessible and affordable to all Minnesotans, to make sure that our kids have an education that prepares them for a 21st century economy, to make Minnesota the epicenter of a new, renewable energy economy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil, to restore our standing in the world and put people to work here at home. To those Minnesotans who worked for me, volunteered for me, voted for me, I can't tell you how grateful I am. When you win an election this close, you know that not one bit of effort went to waste. And to those who devoted their time and energy to supporting Senator Coleman, I can only imagine how hard these past months have been. But no matter whether you voted for me or for Senator Coleman or for Senator Barkley or whether you voted at all, I want the people of Minnesota to know that I'm ready to work for all of you, that I'm committed to being a voice for all Minnesotans in the U.S. Senate. I know there's been a lot of talk about the fact that when I'm sworn in, I'll be the 60th member of the Democratic Caucus. But that's -- that's not how I see it. The way I see it, I'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic senator, I'm going to Washington to be the second senator from the State of Minnesota. And that's how I'm going to do this job.\nMALVEAUX: Minnesota's new senator, Al Franken, saying he is ready to go to work for his state. I want to bring in own Gloria Borger to kind of give us a lay of the land here. Obviously, it's a race that everybody has been following for quite some time. This is the next step now. What -- what does this mean for -- for the Democrats now that they have a larger majority?\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it means that they've got 60 seats, which would give them a filibuster-proof majority. But that's assuming that Democrats, and two Independents who we include in that, would agree on everything which is, of course, a large assumption that is not necessarily true.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: But, of course, they'll take every vote they can get at this point. Don't forget, this has been a hotly contested fight over these last eight months -- very divisive, splitting the parties in the Senate, leaving the State of Minnesota unrepresented. And so I think that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are kind of breathing a sigh of relief that it's -- that it's finally over, no matter how it was decided.\nMALVEAUX: Do you think it helps the Obama administration and the president pushing forward some of the things that have been so difficult for him, whether it's energy or health care?\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: Obviously...\nBORGER: Yes. Sure. I think it does. I mean, look, a vote is a vote is a vote. And I think Al Franken's politics are clearly more on the liberal side. So he would be more likely to go along with Barack Obama on things like climate change, on things like health care reform, than somebody like Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who's much more of a moderate who he may lose on certain votes.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: So I think that they would look at Franken as much more dependable.\nMALVEAUX: OK. Gloria Borger making sense of all of this. Thank you so much.\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: One of Michael Jackson's prized acquisitions was the rights to a vast Beatles music library.

He'll bring his comments to you. Trump is considering running for president. He's expected to make a final decision by June. Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak may be on the move.

Several riot police standing guard outside the hospital say Mubarak is still there. The former president is under investigation for the deaths of protesters during the recent uprising.

In Cuba this weekend, it's national celebration and an important gathering of the communist government. CNN's Shasta Darlington was in Havana today, and you had watched this huge military parade 50 years after the invasion of the Bay of Pigs, really interesting historically.\nSHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Deb. This was a massive celebration of Cuba's past victories. We saw tanks rumbling through revolution plaza, tighter jets flying overhead. Thousands of troops and civilians, people from the neighborhoods coming out and marching in support of their revolution and in celebration of these major victories. It was 50 years ago this small Caribbean island defeated a U.S.-backed invasion of the Bay of Pigs. It was led by Cuban exiles, but it was really considered a defeat for Washington. They failed to provide air support. And of course Cubans never rose up and joined in the fight. A major victory, of course, for Cuba. This afternoon we'll see, as you mentioned, he was going to start looking for the future. The leaders will meet behind closed doors for a four-day meeting of the communist party. In fact, it's the first Congress of the communist party in nearly 14 years. They're going to focus on the economy and needed reforms there. President Raul Castro has called for more private enterprise and less of a role from the state. They want to do major layoffs in the state sector and allow more people to get into business for themselves in things like plumbing, gardening, opening up restaurants. They'll also talk property ownership, which could mean Cubans for the first time in decades could buy and sell homes and possibly even all those old cars could be affected if they allow Cubans to buy and sell more modern vehicles, Deb.\nFEYERICK: Shasta, I read something like 170,000 Cubans have actually taken out licenses to open their own business. Very quickly, why 14 years? Are communists coming from elsewhere? Is this an internal meeting of the leaders there in Cuba?\nDARLINGTON: Deb, it's a good question. They should be holding these meetings every five years. We haven't had one since 1997. Part of the disruption was, of course, when Fidel Castro fell ill, there was the transition from one government to another. Then massive hurricanes sort of hit the economy, global crisis, lots of different reasons. But they couldn't wait any longer. This is probably the first Congress solely dedicated to economic reform and the time is right. They knew they had to do something, and president Raul Castro has already called for many of these reforms.

We are live from the Lanza home, in just a moment with that investigation, standby for that. Also, we are awaiting the arrival of President Obama. He is due here in Newtown shortly. He is going to speak with the families of the 26 people, most of them elementary school children who were shot dead Friday morning. Stay with CNN for that. You will see the president live right here when he arrives. And of course, that interfaith vigil, the entirety, all of it we will bring it to you live. Let's go out to the home where Adam Lanza lived with his mother that home is also right now a crime scene because it appears in Lanza's mother was killed -- killed in the home before the shooting rampage over at the elementary school. CNN's Alison Kosik is joining us now from the Lanza home. Alison, the state police, Connecticut state police, they just gave us an update. For those of the viewers weren't watching CNN live, tell us the main points that the police made.\nALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The state police say that Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother, shooting her multiple times inside the house that is in this neighborhood where I'm standing right now. Police still have the street leading up to his house blocked off. You know, there hasn't been much activity since yesterday afternoon, up until about -- I would say a little over an hour ago, we watched about six police cars drive up several officials got out of their car, talked a built and then got back in the cars and drove off, we assume to Adam Lanza's house. Now, what we did learn throughout the day from state police is that their focus is really was on this school. And what they found was that four weapons were found at the school, three were found in the classroom a shotgun was found in Lanza's car that was parked outside the school. We also learned that Lanza mostly used a semiautomatic weapon called a Bushmaster inside the school to kill those 26 people inside the school. He had, as you said, he shot dozens of bullets and he had hundreds of unused ammunition as well, hundreds of bullets that were not even used. So, it was clear why the medical examiner came out yesterday and explained how Adam Lanza shot those 26 people multiple times, some of them, he shot, said the medical examiner, three to 11 times. It's clear that Lanza carrying that much ammunition on him was looking to cause the most destruction and death - Wolf.\nBLITZER: What a horrific, horrific crime. Alison, thank you so much. So, what happened Friday will make Monday, certainly, a huge challenge for so many families. Let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta who is here with us now. Posttraumatic stress disorder that is going to be a huge problem.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. And you know, we are used to talking about this in the context over adults but it can happen in children and it can happen quickly. I think that's two things people don't always realize. And you know, how the children behave now, how a lot of these things are implemented that you've been talking about with people over the last couple of days, is going to make a big difference, if certain conversations had had. If special care is taken to make sure that children are sleeping well, for example. They are going to be able to cope much better in the long runs. So, you can predict, you know, certain likelihood of success in terms of that coping by what's happening the next few days.\nBLITZER: We think of posttraumatic stress disorder, troops coming home from Afghanistan or Iraq. This is obviously very different than that. But, what are the symptoms? What should we be looking forward to? This is a very serious illness.\nGUPTA: In adults, you know, you think about things like hyper vigilance, difficulty sleeping, very quick and almost hasty reaction. In children, it can be very different. Sometimes don't verbalize it hard late all, changes in how they play. They may, in fact, start playing, you know, toy guns or something like that if they didn't before. They can have regression. So, a 6-year-old can start acting like a younger child, for example. And again, just paying attention to those things and not sort of glossing over, obviously don't want to provide graphic details, make sure you are having conversations. Tomorrow, kids go back to school. They don't know about what happened yet, they probably will by tomorrow.\nBLITZER: I'm sure they will. And if their parents didn't tell them, teachers might tell them or their classmates would tell them.\nGUPTA: Social media.\nBLITZER: Yes. They will hear about. And Sanjay is going to be with us throughout the night. We are awaiting the president of the United States. He is coming here to Newtown to bring some comfort to the families, the first responders. Also, he will participate in the interfaith vigil that will be taking place here in Connecticut.

Other news we're following, dozens of Palestinians were killed today during protests in Gaza along the border with Israel. The demonstrations were aimed at the United States' opening a new embassy in Jerusalem, moving the new embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations says today's violence means there's no chance at peace. Let's get perspective from the Palestinians right now. Joining us, Ambassador Husam Zomlot. He's the head of the Palestinian authorities' delegation to the United States. Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much for joining us. Give us immediate reaction, if you can, to what the latest developments are, the impact of the U.S. moving the embassy, and what it means for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?\nAMB. HUSAM ZOMLOT, DIRECTOR, PLO DELEGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES: Just the U.S. administration has gave up on the peace process and its role as a mediator international towards achieving the internationally endorsed two-state solution. And it also means the U.S. has gave in for the voices of extremism, for the voices we'll see a zero-sum game, the fanatics, politically speaking. It was telling today that the ones who opened the ceremony of moving the U.S. embassy are religious leaders of the Christian Zionists who interpret politics and legality and world map from a very contested, to say the least, religious implications. This is not only encouraging Israel to cross the line. It's very encouraging to Israel to cross the line towards Armageddon and the end-of-time prophecy.\nBLITZER: Ambassador, are you at all, Mr. Ambassador, in touch with Trump administration officials? They keep saying they're about to release their peace plan, Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, and they still have hope for the two-state solution, Israel alongside a new state of Palestine. Have you had conversations with these American officials?\nZOMLOT: We don't know what they're talking about, really. We don't know. Peace is a very firm vision by the U.S. That vision has been drawn by all previous administrations, with the 1968 borders, establishing a sovereign state with each in the U.S. capital. The U.S. law is very clear. It was presented in 1991 by former administrator, James Baker. It is very clear. The U.S. intervention and vision is about Israel's occupation, implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions and respecting them in Jerusalem, never recognizing Israel's control of annexations. So what the U.S. administration has done is reneging on these promises and violating international law. There is a U.N. Security Council resolution that the U.S. voted for and that presents any state from moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And also the U.S. has stated that Jerusalem is outside the negotiating table. You know it, Wolf, very well. You have been there for many decades. But Jerusalem is the heart of the two states solution --\nBLITZER: Let me just interrupt, Ambassador, because they say they're not necessarily concluding all final status of all parts of Jerusalem. Yes, the U.S. is moving the embassy to west Jerusalem, but they're not completely ruling out the possibility of the Palestinians having control of parts of east Jerusalem and having a U.S. embassy in east Jerusalem for the new Palestinian state. When you hear that from the administration, what do you think?\nZOMLOT: No, I only have it from you now. Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people. It's not even the capital of Israel. As I said earlier, a clear religious interpretation of international relations and legal matters on one hand. On the other hand, there was a reason why all previous American presidents, from President Truman to President Obama, why they decided not to move the embassy. They knew, by doing so, you actually remove the U.S. from the role of the mediator and dictate the terms of reference and dictate the outcome of Jerusalem being an issue. Of course, we would be fine if the U.S. has -- when there are two embassies after reaching a peace agreement. Before that, it is -- it will only be seen as urgent on the Palestinians. President Trump himself says removing the Jerusalem from the table, taking it off the table. And then they wanted to remove the administration off the table that services the refugees. And then they are not even criticizing or condemning the illegal settlement expansion, which has been the major obstacle on the part of the two-state solution. And they are not even criticizing or condemning the murder by Israeli forces of the Palestinian peaceful demonstrators. So the bottom line, what peace process this administration is talking about? We believe that peace --\nZOMLOT: -- can be found now in the international community, in a multilateral forum. Peace can only be found based on legality, based on politics, not based on ideology, and some very twisted religious interpretations of reality.\nBLITZER: Ambassador Zomlot, let's see what this -- if they do release a plan, the Trump administration, what specifically it spells out. We'll continue our conversations. Ambassador Zomlot, thanks so much for joining us.\nZOMLOT: Thank you.\nBLITZER: We're going to hear from the White House about these deadly protests in Gaza, along the border with Israel in a few minutes.

Fifteen minutes past the hour. We are following breaking news this morning. It is a shocking story involving the blade runner, Olympic and Paralympic track superstar Oscar Pistorius. He is at the police station in south Africa right now after his model girlfriend was shot and killed inside his home. Police are saying a 26-year-old man has been arrested. They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature. Pistorius, who is a double amputee, reached the 400-meter semifinals in the London Games last year. He races with carbon blades because of a birth defect.\nBERMAN: To New York now where first it was calorie counts on menus, then trans fats, then mega soft drinks. Now, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is out to ban Styrofoam food packaging in stores. It's actually not Styrofoam technically, it's plastic foam. He's looking to ban that in stores and food restaurants. Bloomberg will unveil the plan today in his final State of the City speech.\nSAMBOLIN: And, boy, did you feel that breeze? Look at this. A boxer has suspended for allegedly taking a dive 13 seconds into a fight against former NFL defensive end Ray Edwards. Look at this, the phantom upper cut misses his much smaller opponent Nick “Turbo Tax“ Capes by about a foot. But he sells it, literally knocking himself off his own feet. Reports say “Turbo Tax“ --\nBERMAN: That is insane, I'm sorry. It is nowhere near him.\nSAMBOLIN: I know. But it looked right. So, if you're far away.\nBERMAN: Two miles away.\nSAMBOLIN: “Turbo Tax“ was a last-minute replacement for a couple of no-show boxers. North Dakota's fight governing body is reviewing that right there. It won't take long to jump into a conclusion dare, I say, right?\nBERMAN: Not a tough one to review. Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in “Road Warriors“.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour.

Murray's been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson. Jackson died of an overdose of the anesthesia Propofol and other drugs. To find out what affects these drugs had, I spoke to a doctor who saw Jackson's autopsy report. His name is Dr. Zeev Cain. He is the head of the Anesthesiology Department at the University of California, Irvine.\nLEMON: You saw the toxicology report?\nDR. ZEEV CAIN, DIRECTOR, ANESTHESIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE: I saw the toxicology repot. I saw the autopsy report.\nLEMON: You did?\nCAIN: I did.\nLEMON: What was in Michael Jackson's system?\nCAIN: Several drugs, Midazolam, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Lidocaine, Epinephrine and Propofol.\nLEMON: That's a lot.\nCAIN: That's a lot of drugs. That's a lot of drugs.\nLEMON: Enough to kill someone?\nCAIN: Certainly enough to make sure that he stopped breathing, yes.\nLEMON: Yes. What did the autopsy report show?\nCAIN: Well, overall, Michael Jackson was actually in good health. There was no real problems in his internal organs. It did show, at some point in the past, he did use drugs but, again, overall, he was in excellent health.\nLEMON: What kind of drugs?\nCAIN: You can't really say that. The only thing we can do is go based on what we found in his blood.\nLEMON: OK. It didn't show one drug which the defense is saying he was addicted to. What I'm talking about,\nCAIN: Absolutely true. There was no Demerol found there, which means he did not really take Demerol for 40 days before this.\nLEMON: How many days would it have been in order for it to leave?\nCAIN: Several days. Demerol actually has a pretty long half life. So it stays in the system quite a while.\nLEMON: Yes. Were you surprised by anything in the report?\nCAIN: I would say I was surprised by what in good shape he was. Based on what I've heard previously, I expected to see more signs of chronic illness in his organs, more signs of an addict. They are not really there. He was basically healthy.\nLEMON: Yes. Yes. And to have those drugs, you said Lorazepam --\nCAIN: Diazepam, Midazolam.\nLEMON: All those drugs in there together -- does someone usually take all of those drugs together?\nCAIN: You take them if you want to induce sedation or medically induced coma. Which brings me to the issue of Propofol should not be used in home settings.\nLEMON: Yes.\nCAIN: It should be used when you want to medially induce coma or sedation in a hospital. You have to monitor somebody's blood pressure, heart rate, how well they are breathing. You have to monitor their oxygen level. That's the bottom line.\nLEMON: So, listen, people are -- this is going to be the issue now with medicine. How much can you get from doctors, depending on how much you pay? Your celebrity status? What you do for a living? All of that, is that at issue here?\nCAIN: Absolutely, it is. Remember, they found four gallons. Four gallons are enough to put to sleep about 500 people. Or it is enough to keep somebody asleep for eight hours for almost two months. Now, that may be a bit misleading, because he may have built resistance in his body already. We have to remember, when somebody does take Propofol on a regular basis, they will build up resistance. So I know some reports say it is a two-months supply. It depends how much resistance was in his body. It may only be a one week supply. We don't know.\nLEMON: Is there something we should be concerned about? I heard during the testimony that it is usually a doctor/patient relationship, and maybe this was an employee/employer relationship. Is that a concern to society overall in this case and in society, this culture where you see drugs on television and what have you?\nCAIN: To my opinion, there is a fundamental difference in the Western society versus other societies in the relations between doctor/patient. I think we need to go back to the basics and say doctors are here to take care of patients. It's not a question of you paying me for something. We are not the same as lawyers, to my opinion. We are doctors. Our first sworn duty is to take care of you. Money is secondary. We really need to take care your well being, regardless of how much you will pay for me.\nLEMON: Thank you, doctor.\nCAIN: You're welcome.\nLEMON: Dr. Zeev Cain. My thanks to him at the University of California, Irvine. Stay with CNN. There's more ahead next hour on Dr. Murray's trial.

It's all there. An Internal Revenue Service proposal would allow tax preparers to sell that information to marketing companies and data brokers.\nBETH GIVENS, PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE: I think this is a shockingly bad idea, to allow tax preparers to sell these very sensitive documents. The information contained tells a lot about us, about our families.\nSYLVESTER: The IRS ironically claims that its doing this to improve consumer protections. The agency argues that it would require consent before tax returns could be sent overseas for processing or disclosed to third parties. In a statement, the IRS commissioner said, “The heart of this proposed regulation is about the right of taxpayers to control their tax return information.“ But many consumers could unwittingly sign away their privacy.\nPETER SWIRE, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: The permission here is fake permission. The accountant sets all the little tabs out there and little red tabs and says sign here in all these places. And then you sign the consent and your record is now being sold to a database company.\nSYLVESTER: It's hard to see why consumers would want to have their information sold.\nBETH MCCONNELL, PENN. PIRG: I think it's incredibly significant, not only given the epidemic of identity theft that affects more than 9 million Americans every single year, but also just the barrage of marketing and advertising that consumers are already having a hard time controlling.\nSYLVESTER: Consumer groups say for individuals, there's nothing to gain by having their records sold and everything to lose.\nSYLVESTER: H&R; Block did not return our calls for comment on this story. And there's a real sense that the IRS was trying to fly this one in under the radar. It called the change not a significant regulatory action, although most taxpayers would probably beg to differ, Lou.\nDOBBS: Well, it is under the heading of, you can't make this stuff up.

Several riot police standing guard outside the hospital say Mubarak is still there. The former president is under investigation for the deaths of protesters during the recent uprising.

CNN's Shasta Darlington was in Havana today, and you had watched this huge military parade 50 years after the invasion of the Bay of Pigs, really interesting historically.\nSHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Deb. This was a massive celebration of Cuba's past victories. We saw tanks rumbling through revolution plaza, tighter jets flying overhead. Thousands of troops and civilians, people from the neighborhoods coming out and marching in support of their revolution and in celebration of these major victories. It was 50 years ago this small Caribbean island defeated a U.S.-backed invasion of the Bay of Pigs. It was led by Cuban exiles, but it was really considered a defeat for Washington. They failed to provide air support. And of course Cubans never rose up and joined in the fight. A major victory, of course, for Cuba. This afternoon we'll see, as you mentioned, he was going to start looking for the future. The leaders will meet behind closed doors for a four-day meeting of the communist party. In fact, it's the first Congress of the communist party in nearly 14 years. They're going to focus on the economy and needed reforms there. President Raul Castro has called for more private enterprise and less of a role from the state. They want to do major layoffs in the state sector and allow more people to get into business for themselves in things like plumbing, gardening, opening up restaurants. They'll also talk property ownership, which could mean Cubans for the first time in decades could buy and sell homes and possibly even all those old cars could be affected if they allow Cubans to buy and sell more modern vehicles, Deb.\nFEYERICK: Shasta, I read something like 170,000 Cubans have actually taken out licenses to open their own business. Very quickly, why 14 years? Are communists coming from elsewhere? Is this an internal meeting of the leaders there in Cuba?\nDARLINGTON: Deb, it's a good question. They should be holding these meetings every five years. We haven't had one since 1997. Part of the disruption was, of course, when Fidel Castro fell ill, there was the transition from one government to another. Then massive hurricanes sort of hit the economy, global crisis, lots of different reasons. But they couldn't wait any longer. This is probably the first Congress solely dedicated to economic reform and the time is right. They knew they had to do something, and president Raul Castro has already called for many of these reforms.

And what they found was that four weapons were found at the school, three were found in the classroom a shotgun was found in Lanza's car that was parked outside the school. We also learned that Lanza mostly used a semiautomatic weapon called a Bushmaster inside the school to kill those 26 people inside the school. He had, as you said, he shot dozens of bullets and he had hundreds of unused ammunition as well, hundreds of bullets that were not even used. So, it was clear why the medical examiner came out yesterday and explained how Adam Lanza shot those 26 people multiple times, some of them, he shot, said the medical examiner, three to 11 times. It's clear that Lanza carrying that much ammunition on him was looking to cause the most destruction and death - Wolf.\nBLITZER: What a horrific, horrific crime. Alison, thank you so much. So, what happened Friday will make Monday, certainly, a huge challenge for so many families. Let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta who is here with us now. Posttraumatic stress disorder that is going to be a huge problem.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. And you know, we are used to talking about this in the context over adults but it can happen in children and it can happen quickly. I think that's two things people don't always realize. And you know, how the children behave now, how a lot of these things are implemented that you've been talking about with people over the last couple of days, is going to make a big difference, if certain conversations had had. If special care is taken to make sure that children are sleeping well, for example. They are going to be able to cope much better in the long runs. So, you can predict, you know, certain likelihood of success in terms of that coping by what's happening the next few days.\nBLITZER: We think of posttraumatic stress disorder, troops coming home from Afghanistan or Iraq. This is obviously very different than that. But, what are the symptoms? What should we be looking forward to? This is a very serious illness.\nGUPTA: In adults, you know, you think about things like hyper vigilance, difficulty sleeping, very quick and almost hasty reaction. In children, it can be very different. Sometimes don't verbalize it hard late all, changes in how they play. They may, in fact, start playing, you know, toy guns or something like that if they didn't before. They can have regression. So, a 6-year-old can start acting like a younger child, for example. And again, just paying attention to those things and not sort of glossing over, obviously don't want to provide graphic details, make sure you are having conversations. Tomorrow, kids go back to school. They don't know about what happened yet, they probably will by tomorrow.\nBLITZER: I'm sure they will. And if their parents didn't tell them, teachers might tell them or their classmates would tell them.\nGUPTA: Social media.\nBLITZER: Yes. They will hear about. And Sanjay is going to be with us throughout the night. We are awaiting the president of the United States. He is coming here to Newtown to bring some comfort to the families, the first responders. Also, he will participate in the interfaith vigil that will be taking place here in Connecticut.

Just minutes ago, Argentina lost to Croatia three nail. That would make it extremely difficult for Argentina to advance out of their group. On the pitch today, France beat Peru, one nail. Yay. Which moves them into the knockout stage of the World Cup. Russia and Uruguay, so far, are the only other teams to advance. Russia's success certainly is a surprise. They came into the cup as the lowest rated team in the tournament. They have something called a home advantage though, I think Fred Pleitgen has been following the Russian national team and he's in Moscow. Fred.\nFREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hala, we visited their training camp earlier today and what we saw there was a very confident team, obviously bolstered by those two win that they got and a team that believes that they could do great things at the World Cup. And so now does this nation. Here's what we saw.\nPLEITGEN: It's not often that you see Russians this emotional. But the country's been in a football frenzy ever since the World Cup started. Thanks to Russia's Cinderella squad, a team most experts thought would fail miserably, but has outscored its opponents Eight to one so far. Defender Andrei Semyonov told me the team always believed in itself. Nobody believed in us, he says, now everyone does and they're starting to put medals on us. But we don't look at it. We studied our opponents really well and predicted everything. But few observers could have predicted their success. Russia is the lowest ranked team at the World Cup. Wouldn't have even qualified if they weren't the host nation. And many feared the mood at the World Cup would sour and the home team performed poorly. Now, the squad, led by striker Artem Dzyuba is on a roll. Team Russia has already proved all of its critics wrong, well, in all of its matches and already qualifying for the next round. And now both this nation and this team believe they can do great things at the FIFA 2018 World Cup. And with a successful squad, Russians are embracing their nation's role as hosts of the tournament. Striker Fyodor Kudryashov telling me, home field advantage has also helped elevate the team's performance. The fans are the 12th player on the field for us, he said. We feel their overwhelming support and our team goes forward. If there is a knock on the Russians, it's that they haven't played any of the really strong teams so far. But for now, Russia is enjoying the winning streak, hoping their World Cup fairy tale doesn't end any time soon.\nPLEITGEN: And, Hala, of course the next game they have will be against the stronger team, it's against Uruguay. And after that, of course, we get to the knockout stages and it's really going to be there that the Russians are going to show whether they are for real or not, Hala.\nGORANI: Yes, we will be watching. Thanks, Fred. For Shakespeare, it was the sonnet, for Rembrandt and Picasso, a masterpiece painted in oils. But in this day and age, there seems to be only one way to truly honor the special moments in our life.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let me take a selfie. The Chainsmokers there capturing the very essence of social media's magnum opus, the selfie. A photographic custom being honored today on National Selfie Day. Selfie is a relatively new term. But did you know the first selfie was taken in 1839 by photographer Robert Cornelius in Philadelphia? Truly a visionary, so who we were to resist the tide of history? This is our HALA GORANI TONIGHT team in London. That's a selfie. One of these team has a super long arm. We reached out to our colleagues at CNN center in the U.S., but unfortunately, they were all having bad hair days. So instead, and keeping with another great internet tradition, here's a picture of a selfie taking cat, and his name is Manny. Manny takes these photos with a GoPro cam, and he's seen here with a close friend. New Zealand's prime minister has given birth, becoming only the second female world leader to do so while in office. Jacinda Ardern and her partner Clarke Gayford posted this snap with their newborn daughter earlier. Is it a selfie? Looks like it could be, actually. She will now take six weeks maternity leave and has handed over her responsibilities to the deputy prime minister, who is now serving as acting prime minister. She follows in the footsteps of the former Pakistani Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, who had a child while in office in 1990. Thanks for watching tonight, everyone. I'm Hala Gorani.

Fifteen minutes past the hour. We are following breaking news this morning. It is a shocking story involving the blade runner, Olympic and Paralympic track superstar Oscar Pistorius. He is at the police station in south Africa right now after his model girlfriend was shot and killed inside his home. Police are saying a 26-year-old man has been arrested. They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature. Pistorius, who is a double amputee, reached the 400-meter semifinals in the London Games last year. He races with carbon blades because of a birth defect.\nBERMAN: To New York now where first it was calorie counts on menus, then trans fats, then mega soft drinks. Now, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is out to ban Styrofoam food packaging in stores. It's actually not Styrofoam technically, it's plastic foam. He's looking to ban that in stores and food restaurants. Bloomberg will unveil the plan today in his final State of the City speech.\nSAMBOLIN: And, boy, did you feel that breeze? Look at this. A boxer has suspended for allegedly taking a dive 13 seconds into a fight against former NFL defensive end Ray Edwards. Look at this, the phantom upper cut misses his much smaller opponent Nick “Turbo Tax“ Capes by about a foot. But he sells it, literally knocking himself off his own feet. Reports say “Turbo Tax“ --\nBERMAN: That is insane, I'm sorry. It is nowhere near him.\nSAMBOLIN: I know. But it looked right. So, if you're far away.\nBERMAN: Two miles away.\nSAMBOLIN: “Turbo Tax“ was a last-minute replacement for a couple of no-show boxers. North Dakota's fight governing body is reviewing that right there. It won't take long to jump into a conclusion dare, I say, right?\nBERMAN: Not a tough one to review. Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in “Road Warriors“.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour.

I am convinced anchor baby could become the self- support of 2016. Once Mitt Romney went there in the campaign four years ago, it was over with Latino voters.\nASHLEY PARKER, “THE NEW YORK TIMES“: Right, I mean, it certainly was and here's the thing, Jeb Bush is a self-described policy wonk and a self-described nerd ball and so he wants to be talking about the policy and Trump has clearly gotten Jeb Bush and all the other Republicans off their game, and of course, this was some sort of make this about language and rhetoric. And when you're trying to substitute one group -- with another group, he is now offended, you're simply not winning regardless if you have very good policy that a lot of immigration activists agree with as Jeb does.\nKING: I think Mr. Trump is under the governor's skin, fair to say?\nROBERT COSTA, “THE WASHINGTON POST“: He is. I spoke to Trump yesterday. He just continues to slam Bush. And he loves it. I said are you going to stop it ever? He said, probably not and on immigration especially this has put the Republican Party in a tough position. The base loves what Trump is saying on immigration. Whether it plays in a general election, who knows?\nKING: Right, but the calendar has been changed, those southern states are going to be a lot more important this time.\nCOSTA: Even if you don't get a big bounce out of those early February caucuses and primaries, March 1st, nine states, south.\nKING: You mentioned he says he may not stop going after Governor Bush, someone needs to help me understand why he thinks it's in his benefit, to his benefit to keep going after Megyn Kelly. Megyn Kelly was on vacation. Donald Trump tweeting out last night at Megyn Kelly, “Must have had a terrible vacation. She is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration.“ That was about the “Kelly File“ last night. Later he tweets, “I like the “Kelly File“ much better without Megyn Kelly. Maybe she could take another 11-day unscheduled vacation“ so two sort of gratuitous shots at her there. What I think is a bigger problem. He then again re-tweeted a tweet where somebody called her a bimbo. He did that right after the Fox debate when he had the confrontation with her and he does it again last night. No rules apply to Donald Trump, but I cannot see how that is in his interest.\nPARKET: I was very stunned to see those tweets as well. Donald Trump is in a weird way a post Fox News candidate, a post everything candidate. The rules of traditional politics do not apply. You cannot go to war with Fox News. You try to get booked on all of their shows, right? And he's doing the exact opposite and crowd loves him for it.\nCOSTA: I was at a focus group last night of Trump supporters in Virginia and the one thing -- these were all Trump supporters, the one thing that really turned them off, Trump's comments about women. He should be paying attention to the voters. It's not acceptable if you're a presidential candidate.\nKING: Interesting point. We'll see how this plays out. Betsy Klein sent out a note saying she was talking to a Trump supporter who said, as a parent, it makes me cringe, some of the stuff he puts out on Twitter. Ashley, Robert, thanks for coming in. Alisyn, it's a very interesting. We'll see how the Jeb-Trump thing I think is going to be. We have that CNN debate coming up in just a few weeks. I think the Jeb-Trump thing is going to be the biggest head- butt.\nALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: The thing to watch. All right, we look forward to that debate, September 16th. John, thanks so much.

But if I did, you would be the first to know about it.\nKIDDER: Um.\nBLITZER: Her family says she passed away quietly in her home in Montana. Margot kidder was 69 years old. Other news we're following, dozens of Palestinians were killed today during protests in Gaza along the border with Israel. The demonstrations were aimed at the United States' opening a new embassy in Jerusalem, moving the new embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations says today's violence means there's no chance at peace. Let's get perspective from the Palestinians right now. Joining us, Ambassador Husam Zomlot. He's the head of the Palestinian authorities' delegation to the United States. Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much for joining us. Give us immediate reaction, if you can, to what the latest developments are, the impact of the U.S. moving the embassy, and what it means for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?\nAMB. HUSAM ZOMLOT, DIRECTOR, PLO DELEGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES: Just the U.S. administration has gave up on the peace process and its role as a mediator international towards achieving the internationally endorsed two-state solution. And it also means the U.S. has gave in for the voices of extremism, for the voices we'll see a zero-sum game, the fanatics, politically speaking. It was telling today that the ones who opened the ceremony of moving the U.S. embassy are religious leaders of the Christian Zionists who interpret politics and legality and world map from a very contested, to say the least, religious implications. This is not only encouraging Israel to cross the line. It's very encouraging to Israel to cross the line towards Armageddon and the end-of-time prophecy.\nBLITZER: Ambassador, are you at all, Mr. Ambassador, in touch with Trump administration officials? They keep saying they're about to release their peace plan, Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, and they still have hope for the two-state solution, Israel alongside a new state of Palestine. Have you had conversations with these American officials?\nZOMLOT: We don't know what they're talking about, really. We don't know. Peace is a very firm vision by the U.S. That vision has been drawn by all previous administrations, with the 1968 borders, establishing a sovereign state with each in the U.S. capital. The U.S. law is very clear. It was presented in 1991 by former administrator, James Baker. It is very clear. The U.S. intervention and vision is about Israel's occupation, implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions and respecting them in Jerusalem, never recognizing Israel's control of annexations. So what the U.S. administration has done is reneging on these promises and violating international law. There is a U.N. Security Council resolution that the U.S. voted for and that presents any state from moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And also the U.S. has stated that Jerusalem is outside the negotiating table. You know it, Wolf, very well. You have been there for many decades. But Jerusalem is the heart of the two states solution --\nBLITZER: Let me just interrupt, Ambassador, because they say they're not necessarily concluding all final status of all parts of Jerusalem. Yes, the U.S. is moving the embassy to west Jerusalem, but they're not completely ruling out the possibility of the Palestinians having control of parts of east Jerusalem and having a U.S. embassy in east Jerusalem for the new Palestinian state. When you hear that from the administration, what do you think?\nZOMLOT: No, I only have it from you now. Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people. It's not even the capital of Israel. As I said earlier, a clear religious interpretation of international relations and legal matters on one hand. On the other hand, there was a reason why all previous American presidents, from President Truman to President Obama, why they decided not to move the embassy. They knew, by doing so, you actually remove the U.S. from the role of the mediator and dictate the terms of reference and dictate the outcome of Jerusalem being an issue. Of course, we would be fine if the U.S. has -- when there are two embassies after reaching a peace agreement. Before that, it is -- it will only be seen as urgent on the Palestinians. President Trump himself says removing the Jerusalem from the table, taking it off the table. And then they wanted to remove the administration off the table that services the refugees. And then they are not even criticizing or condemning the illegal settlement expansion, which has been the major obstacle on the part of the two-state solution. And they are not even criticizing or condemning the murder by Israeli forces of the Palestinian peaceful demonstrators. So the bottom line, what peace process this administration is talking about? We believe that peace --\nZOMLOT: -- can be found now in the international community, in a multilateral forum. Peace can only be found based on legality, based on politics, not based on ideology, and some very twisted religious interpretations of reality.\nBLITZER: Ambassador Zomlot, let's see what this -- if they do release a plan, the Trump administration, what specifically it spells out. We'll continue our conversations. Ambassador Zomlot, thanks so much for joining us.\nZOMLOT: Thank you.\nBLITZER: We're going to hear from the White House about these deadly protests in Gaza, along the border with Israel in a few minutes.

The question is whether Congress will actually change immigration law - lawmakers are deeply divided. It is possible to imagine a compromise, as we'll here in a moment, but yesterday lawmakers put their differences on display. Senators turned up in Philadelphia to highlight the value of foreign workers, even those who came here illegally. Members of the House went to the opposite coast to make an opposing point. In San Diego, they stressed the need for tighter border security. Our coverage starts with NPR's Carrie Kahn.\nCARRIE KAHN reporting: California Congressman Ed Royce picked a San Diego border patrol station to hold his Terrorism Subcommittee hearing in hopes of drumming up public support for the House immigration bill. Royce says by building more fences and hiring thousands of agents, the border will be safer.\nRepresentative ED ROYCE (Republican, California): Immigration reform must be national security reform. Our country has made progress in fighting terrorism since 9/11, but in some areas we're losing ground, including the most fundamental task of securing our physical borders.\nKAHN: Republicans highlighted the potential for terrorists coming into the U.S. from Mexico. Sheriff Rick Flores of Webb County, Texas, testified that he and his handful of deputies are outnumbered by drug dealers and smugglers. Congressman Ted Poe of Houston asked him about even greater threats.\nRepresentative TED POE (Republican, Texas): Explain why, in your opinion, al-Qaida would set up operation in Mexico and come here.\nSheriff RICK FLORES (Webb County, Texas): Well, Mr. Poe, it's very easy for these people to go ahead and blend in in Mexico, learn the language, learn the culture, and camouflage themselves as Mexicans crossing the border.\nRepresentative TED POE (Republican, Texas): Is it your opinion that that may happen, may even actually be going on?\nSheriff RICK FLORES (Webb County, Texas): It's probably already happened.\nKAHN: House Democrats are quick to point to vulnerabilities at the Canadian border, which one Congressional study put at greater risk for terrorist incursions. And on several occasions, Democrats blamed six years of the Bush administration for failing to control the nation's borders. But Republicans pressed on.

That's the old saying anyway. And some people in Cincinnati want to live up to it. Their group is called May We Help. Handymen, technicians and engineers volunteer to make devices that help people with disabilities do things that others take for granted. Cheri Lawson of member station WNKU introduces us to one of the members.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Bill Sand loves to spend time in his basement. He calls it his man cave, but there's no big screen TV, sound system or beer cooler here.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Just power tools and whatever else he needs to build things.\nBILL SAND: So these will go through the planer a few more times.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: This 66-year-old is like a lot of guys who tinker. But here's where Bill's a bit different. He designs and builds devices for people with disabilities - and he does it for free.\nBILL SAND: These are gifts that are special, that are life-changing.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Here in his home workshop, Bill has made a custom scooter for a little girl who can't walk, and cello stands for sisters, even though they don't have arms. Twelve-year-old Inga and 10-year-old Ylena Elena Petry of Pennsylvania play with their feet.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Their mom, Jennifer, says the girls used to prop their instruments on pillows on the floor. But that didn't really work out.\nJENNIFER PETRY: We needed something to keep the cellos steady.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Inga uses her toes for everything, from eating to texting.\nJENNIFER PETRY: When my mom told me that we were going to get something so that my cello wouldn't wobble, I was really happy because I'd be able to play it better.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: The Petrys are just one of the families Bill has helped pursue their dreams. He's made several one-of-a-kind devices for nine-year-old Ireland Reed. She has a rare genetic condition called Miller's Syndrome. She needs a special walker just to stand. Bill has become a regular visitor to Ireland's home in suburban Cincinnati.\nBILL SAND: Hello, Amy.\nAMY REID: Hello. How are you?\nBILL SAND: Good.\nAMY REID: Ireland, it's Bill.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Ireland is excited to see Bill, and she rolls over to him on the scooter he made for her. The family calls it her shamrock express. It's given her mobility she'd never had before. Ireland's mom, Amy, calls Bill a godsend.\nAMY REID: It's like, how do you know? Bill, how do you know what we need when we don't even know what we need?\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: During this visit, Amy says Ireland is having trouble writing with her partially formed hand. Bill crouches so he can watch carefully as the child tries to hold a pencil. He puts his hand gently around hers, thinking about what he can do to help.\nBILL SAND: Ireland, I just want your hand. You just put your hand like this.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: He brainstorms with Amy about what he might come up with but says even a simple solution might take five or six tries.\nBILL SAND: I'm thinking of something that'll glide real easy, that her hand is actually sitting on. Kind of like a mouse.\nAMY REID: We can't thank him enough. I can't find the words to really tell you how it's helped us and helped Ireland.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Bill Sand has done dozens of projects for families like the Reeds and Petrys.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Jennifer Petry says the mahogany cello stands Bill crafted for her kids are not only practical but beautiful.\nJENNIFER PETRY: Just so beautiful.

The International Olympic Committee has elected Jacques Rogge of Belgium to an eight-year term, replacing Juan Antonio Samaranch, of Spain. The two met with reporters in Moscow, including our Patrick Snell, who's there.\nPATRICK SNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Colleen, that's right: the Samaranch era has officially come to an end after 21 years. Now all eyes will be focusing on the 59-year old orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, Jacques Rogge. Out of all the candidates, in terms of sporting politics, he was perhaps the man with the least experience -- but his very, very widespread reputation is of being a smooth diplomat; an IOC problem solver, if you like; and a man widely credited with organizing the phenomenally successful Sydney, Australia, Games last year. Rogge has a great sporting background himself. He competed in the '68, '72, and '76 Olympic Games, as a sailor, and also played rugby for his country, and is today happy to share center stage with the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch -- and a really lovely touch when he presented Samaranch himself with an Olympic Gold Medal for his own achievements. Absolutely typical of the man -- smooth talking -- and a very, very popular decision. Now a word about the rivals he beat. Rogge in the second round of voting, he won. He totaled 59 votes. That was well clear of his closest rival, the South Korean politician Un-yong Kim, who got 23 votes. That's one clear of the Canadian lawyer, Dick Pound. So the new IOC president, the Belgian Jacques Rogge -- Colleen.\nMCEDWARDS: All right, thanks very much, Patrick.\nBRIAN NELSON, CNN ANCHOR: And our next guest is Melinda McKay. She's the senior vice president of a company called Jones Lang LaSalle. This is a firm that did an Olympic study on the long-term impact that cities who've received the Olympic Games are able to benefit from. And they've gone back and studied Sydney, Atlanta, Barcelona, and Seoul. So we now introduce Melinda McKay. Let's talk about Beijing. First of all, thank you for being with us, Ms. McKay. Why the study and who paid for it -- very quickly.\nMELINDA MCKAY, JONES LANG LASALLE: The study was done based on the fact that I was actually in Sydney last year, and I was seeing firsthand what was happening in the markets, the sort of infrastructure developments that were occurring and I thought it would be very interesting for our clients to actually take a look at what happened in past host cities and see if there were any consistencies across that.\nNELSON: Summarize what you found.\nMCKAY: We found that although there are certainly short-term economic gains to be had from the Olympics -- between $3 billion and $17 billion, depending on which of the past four host cities you look at. But really, the long-term legacy is in the change to the urban form of the city. At least the past four Olympic host cities have really used the Games to revitalize rundown urban areas.\nNELSON: All right and what would be the biggest example you'd like to point to?\nMCKAY: I would take the Sydney experience, because as I said before, I was seeing it first hand. They essentially turned the Olympic Village from a munitions dump -- it was an unusable industrial front -- into the world's most environmentally friendly suburb. And if you take the Atlanta example, they spent $1 billion on capital works as a result of the Games and have revitalized the downtown area.\nNELSON: In Atlanta, there was a change, in a sense, to the infrastructure around the Centennial Park, which was created to honor the Olympics. But by and large, some people may question whether all of this was worth the millions and millions -- or maybe I should say billions of dollars -- that are poured into getting the Olympic Games. Does it really balance out?\nMCKAY: I really do think it does, if you just take a pure look at the net economic gain that is measured from the Olympic Games -- and it, as I said before, ranges between $3 billion and $17 billion, and that's just the short-term gain; you've got the long-term changes to the urban form, which are just tremendous.\nNELSON: For residents of Beijing, if the city goes ahead and keeps its promises, what should residents be seeing by the year 2008 to their city?\nMCKAY: The Beijing of 2008 will definitely be significantly different from the city that we see now. Beijing is spending $12.2 billion on environmental improvements and antipollution measures. They're spending $3.7 billion on transport infrastructure. They are turning their Olympic Village -- the Olympic Green -- into a 200-acre park, and they're surrounding that by a nature park as well. So there are very exciting changes that we'll see for Beijing.\nNELSON: Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us this morning, Melinda McKay, from Jones Lang LaSalle, and we appreciate your being here.\nMCKAY: Thank you.

Fifteen minutes past the hour. We are following breaking news this morning. It is a shocking story involving the blade runner, Olympic and Paralympic track superstar Oscar Pistorius. He is at the police station in south Africa right now after his model girlfriend was shot and killed inside his home. Police are saying a 26-year-old man has been arrested. They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature. Pistorius, who is a double amputee, reached the 400-meter semifinals in the London Games last year. He races with carbon blades because of a birth defect.\nBERMAN: To New York now where first it was calorie counts on menus, then trans fats, then mega soft drinks. Now, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is out to ban Styrofoam food packaging in stores. It's actually not Styrofoam technically, it's plastic foam. He's looking to ban that in stores and food restaurants. Bloomberg will unveil the plan today in his final State of the City speech.\nSAMBOLIN: And, boy, did you feel that breeze? Look at this. A boxer has suspended for allegedly taking a dive 13 seconds into a fight against former NFL defensive end Ray Edwards. Look at this, the phantom upper cut misses his much smaller opponent Nick “Turbo Tax“ Capes by about a foot. But he sells it, literally knocking himself off his own feet. Reports say “Turbo Tax“ --\nBERMAN: That is insane, I'm sorry. It is nowhere near him.\nSAMBOLIN: I know. But it looked right. So, if you're far away.\nBERMAN: Two miles away.\nSAMBOLIN: “Turbo Tax“ was a last-minute replacement for a couple of no-show boxers. North Dakota's fight governing body is reviewing that right there. It won't take long to jump into a conclusion dare, I say, right?\nBERMAN: Not a tough one to review. Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in “Road Warriors“.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour.

I'm Michele Norris.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And I'm Melissa Block.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: President Obama is looking for ways to cut the budget. Yesterday, his former rival for the presidency, Senator John McCain, suggested he look no further than the White House lawn.\nMICHELE NORRIS, Host: Your helicopter is now going to cost as much as Air Force One. I don't think that there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers enormous amount of money.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And the president didn't disagree.\nP: The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me.\nP: Of course, I've never had a helicopter before.\nP: You know, maybe I've been deprived, and I didn't know it. But I think it is an example of the procurement process gone amuck.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And joining us to talk about this pricey helicopter is Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Tom, what's the history here?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, this all started after the September 11th attacks. White House officials went to the Pentagon and said, listen, the president needs a better helicopter, one that can protect him in a better way, and also one where he can have better communications, talk with anyone in the world from his helicopter.\nTOM BOWMAN: And also, the current fleet is almost 40 years old, started flying during Gerald Ford's administration back in the mid-'70s, and they are getting to the end of their lifespan. They're looking at 2017, and that will be the end of these helicopters.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: What else do they want this new helicopter to do?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, I just talked with Loren Thompson. He's a defense analyst. He knows a lot about this program. And here's his list of what they want it to have.\nD: Many of the things that are carried on the presidential helicopter are secret. However, what we do know is that it has extensive self-protection capabilities against surface-to-air missiles; that it has hundreds of pounds of very secret communications equipment so the president can stay in touch with foreign leaders where there's nuclear forces and so on; that it has a kitchen, it has a bathroom, it has seating for 14 people, and it has a multiperson crew.\nTOM BOWMAN: Now, it also has to be small enough to land in that tight confinement of the White House grounds. And the other thing, they want it to go farther. The current helicopter goes maybe 150 miles before it has to refuel. This one, they want to go 300 miles in the event of a nuclear attack.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And meantime, this helicopter - fleet of helicopters is over budget and overdue.\nTOM BOWMAN: That's right. What happened is they kept adding requirements to it. They want it to be able to prevent a missile attack, better communications and so forth. Even the seats had to be able to take nine G's in case it drops out of the sky, and it can protect people. And they've built five of these already, and the next line of 23 will have an even more equipment. And there's talk about adding a new engine to compensate for the added weight.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Why do they need 28?\nTOM BOWMAN: It's not only the president who will use these but also the vice president, some of the top leaders, Defense Secretary Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And also, when the president goes around the country or overseas, they'll bring the helicopter along with him.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Now, when Senator John McCain says this is more expensive than Air Force One, is he right?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, he is. In 1990, when they procured the two Air Force One planes, it was a total cost of $650 million, so roughly $325 million each. But a better comparison might be the F22 fighter, the Air Force's most sophisticated jet, and that cost roughly the same as one of these helicopters - around $400 million.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Well, what happens now? And Barack Obama said this is a procurement process run amock. Do they scrap it? What do they do?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, it's a good question. Now, they have five now in flight testing. And they said Obama or someone else might be able to fly this in the next year and a half or so. So the question is, will they build the additional 23 with this added equipment? We don't know the answer to that yet. But the one thing we do know is the current fleet of helicopters is getting old, and they need some replacement.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Okay.

The U.S. flag raised above the American embassy in Havana for the first time in 54 years. The U.S. and Cuba marking their resumption of diplomatic relations. But what happens now between the two countries? Joining me from Houston, CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, and in New York, Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, whose father Arthur Schlesinger worked in and wrote extensively about the Kennedy White House. Good to see both of you.\nDOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Thank you.\nSTEPHEN SCHLESINGER, ADJUNCT FELLOW, CENTURY FOUNDATION: Nice to see you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. So, Stephen, to you first. You know, what was that moment like for you, and did your dad ever talk about possibly seeing that kind of day, or that day happening, like what we saw yesterday?\nSCHLESINGER: I think he always wanted this day to happen. I don't think he would have realized it was going to take another 50 years. You know, it's quite remarkable. Ten presidents I believe have been in office since the embargo was instituted against Cuba. Finally, we have a president who made a breakthrough and it's a very impressive turnaround, and I think it will pay very much dividends, both with our relationship with Cuba as well as with the entire Latin American community.\nWHITFIELD: And so, Douglas, you know, this ceremony was full of symbolism, you know, from the U.S. Marines involved 54 years ago, taking the flag down, to now being the ones to help raise the flag. Apparently the cane that Secretary of State, you know, Kerry was walking on also had its significance there. How important was this moment to set a tone, so to speak, of how these two countries will be working together this day forward?\nBRINKLEY: Well, it's a very important tone-setting moment for John Kerry. It's one of the high watermarks of his tenure as secretary of state. Barack Obama will most likely get very high marks in history for kind of healing U.S.-Cuban relations. But we've got to be cautious here. Embassies can open and they can close. We had an embassy in Venezuela, in Caracas, running and then we shut it down. We'll have to see. We're not -- the friendship with the United States and Cuba is not ironclad at this juncture. There's still human rights issues. And if we ever find out that Cuba is in some ways sponsoring terrorism against the United States, things could dissolve. But for the moment, as Stephen Schlesinger said, this is a very healing moment after this many decades of the United States and Cuba at each other's throats. It looks like now a friendship is blooming.\nWHITFIELD: And blooming in what way do you see, Stephen? Because yes, unfinished business. We're still talking about, you know, an embargo that has yet to be lifted. It takes an act of Congress in order for that to happen. But what do you see next in the short term as opposed to the long term?\nSCHLESINGER: Well, I think there are going to be a series of small steps. I think Doug is quite right that -- you know, Cuba is not going to change overnight. In fact, it may not change for years. So the small steps are important. I think right now Secretary Kerry has been talking about some of them. For example, dealing with narcotics interdiction, or the environment, or issues of financial transactions or agriculture or telecommunications. All those issues are pretty straightforward and can be dealt with in a bilateral basis. But when you get into the issues of human rights, the settlement of expropriated property of Cubans and Americans, and issues of democracy, it's -- you're talking about a much longer-term situation.\nWHITFIELD: And then, Douglas, you know, just listening to the ceremony and listening to the -- whether it be the poet or even Secretary Kerry, some beautiful, you know, words that were being used. And when using language like, you know, as two peoples who are no longer enemies or rivals, but neighbors playing the Cuban national anthem first, and then later playing, you know, the U.S. national anthem. In what way do you see those as, you know, significant moves in order to really kind of thaw the ice?\nBRINKLEY: Well, I think the Cuban people and the American people have a shared rich history. And so one of the ways that the ice thawing is going to happen are cultural exchanges. Students going down to Cuba now. People going to do tourism. I went down to Cuba just to see the sight of the Bay of Pigs invasion. And went to see where Theodore Roosevelt's, you know, history down there. It's an amazing place, Havana. So I think the influx of American tourists going to Cuba is going to be quite remarkable. And when people start talking and dialoguing, sharing music, food, it's a chance for these two countries to get much closer. And also Fidel Castro is on his last legs, so to speak. And Raul Castro has shown more of an -- shown signs that he liked to get along with the United States. So for some people that remember the Cuban missile crisis, this is really a moment to celebrate when tensions are at an all-time low right now.\nWHITFIELD: Yes, neither of the Castros were there, but, you know, their aura, indeed.\nWHITFIELD: You know, is certainly in the vicinity.\nBRINKLEY: Yes.\nWHITFIELD: Stephen Schlesinger and Douglas Brinkley, thanks to both of you.

You're out of the house. Your baby needs a diaper change, and you can't find a bathroom with a changing table. You've probably resorted to a public diaper changing. It's a little awkward for everyone involved. But when the person who needs that diaper change is a disabled or elderly adult, it can be worse than awkward.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Around the country, there are a handful of places that have installed private family restrooms equipped with adult changing tables. The airports in Phoenix, Baltimore and Orlando are a few. Sabrina Kimball of Tallahassee would like to see many more of them. She founded a group called Universal Changing Places and now joins us on the program. Welcome.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, thank you so much for having me.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'd like you to tell us the story of how you encountered this problem with your teenage son, Greyson, who had bacterial meningitis, I guess, as a very small child.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, Greyson contracted bacterial meningitis when he was a baby. He was premature. And he developed it when he was 10 days old. And unfortunately, it caused a lot of developmental delays and cerebral palsy. So Greyson is non-ambulatory. He's now 19, and he weighs about almost 75 pounds. And this has become a big challenge for us as we go out in public to try to include him in different activities.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: There is no safe clean place to change him. He has out - he outgrew the baby changing tables years ago. And what we're advocating for are powered height-adjustable adult changing tables to be added to family restrooms in different venues so that people have a safe clean place, and they're not resorting to either leaving the venue or laying their loved one on a public restroom floor.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: In the absence of such facilities, what do you do? What happens?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Mainly I leave. If I can't find - like if I'm at a mall, I will look in dressing rooms and try to see if there might be a bench that we might awkwardly do a seat cover change, but most of the time we leave, you know, unless it's a major accident. And then, you know, we have had to take out our pad and try to do something on a floor, which is, you know, not something I enjoy doing at all.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: You spoke of a seat cover change.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: (Laughter) Oh, I'm sorry. That is my nickname. As Greyson's gotten older, instead of saying a diaper change, I call them seat covers. It just sounded better because he's older.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: What are you hoping to see? What would be a reasonable public response to this problem.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: What we're hoping to see is that more and more venues like our hospitals, our malls, our rest areas, our airports will add these to their family restrooms so that you do have this facility to change somebody. It seems like such a simple thing, but it's a major thing for people that have older adults that are non-ambulatory or have self-care issues.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: It would seem to me this eliminates both a terrible physical inconvenience you'd be posed with but also some embarrassment, I should think that it addresses.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes. But also, it's an area of dignity for that person, too. I mean, how many people if you have an accident like that want to have to stay in that until they get home because there is no place to change them?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: And I talked to a gentleman when I first started my campaign. He is a quadriplegic. And the one thing he mentioned to me when I first told him about what I was doing, he said, you don't want to know how many bathroom floors I've laid on in my life. And I was like - it just broke my heart. I'm thinking this is not right. This is something we can do something about.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: That is Sabrina Kimball speaking to us via Skype from Tallahassee.

And as Colin Powell has said very often, if that is the truth, why not have inspectors come back and look and see and prove to the world that you don't have any of those weapons? Well, here they are today at the U.N. talking about having inspectors come back. That's a real wrench for them, because Saddam's deepest interest is in keeping weapons of mass destruction and, therefore, not having inspectors. So why are they doing this? Paula, they are doing it, because they are scared stiff of U.S. military action, and this is a ploy to try to head off that action by saying, hey, wait a minute. We are going to come back under the law. We are going to have inspectors come into our country. That's what it's about.\nZAHN: But, Richard, realistically how much time can the Iraqis buy here?\nBUTLER: I don't think very much, and the devil will be in the detail. You see, Kofi Annan, the secretary general, has made clear that there is only one subject on the agenda, which is that you come back -- you, Iraq, come back into conformity with the law, and the law says they must be inspected and those weapons of mass destruction removed. What Iraq will do is say, OK, we are prepared to do that, but we want to know exactly what those inspections will look like, what will be the rules. In other words, they will start, I think, that same game they have played with my team in the past, a sort of shell game, where through procedural and other devices, they will seek to prevent the inspections from being effective. That's what the U.S. has to watch out for, because if it looks like the secretary general or the international community is going to allow Iraq to have inspections, but inspections which are useless, some would say worse than useless, then that will be a serious problem. I don't think they'll get away with it. They are going to try it, but the short answer to your question is that, no, I don't think it will work.\nZAHN: All right. But how much does it hurt the Iraqis' case that this information has become public now, 24 hours in advance of these important high-level meetings, that they have converted these trucks into trucks of wartime use potentially?\nBUTLER: Well, I think it does hurt their case, but let's not be too sanguine about that. This sort of information has been around for a very long time, but Iraq has had sufficient supporters -- political supporters to try to water it down or dismiss its significance. Some will argue that this information has come to light on the eve of these talks and is therefore in some way an attempt to prejudice the, you know, the outcome of those talks. The politics of this are very complex. Now, they had clarified somewhat since September 11, and certainly in the Iraqi mind, the president got their attention with his State of the Union speech, when he made very clear that the U.S. is not going to sit back and wait for countries like Iraq, declared to be part of the so-called axis of evil, to develop weapons of mass destruction. That if it's seen that they have them, the U.S. will take action first. Now, in the meantime, it has been made clear that before that action takes place, there will be one more attempt to get serious inspections back into Iraq. This is what we are seeing unfold today. Will it work? Will it result in serious inspections? Will it hold off U.S. action? I strongly doubt it, because Saddam's first and basic interest is in keeping his weapons of mass destruction, and frankly I think whatever inspections are agreed to, it probably won't be real.\nZAHN: Well, we are going to be watching this very closely from here at CNN -- Richard, good to see you again. We are very jealous that you have been surfing, but we can't complain too badly about the weather here.\nBUTLER: Well, I'll be back with you soon, I hope.\nZAHN: Travel well. Thank you, Ambassador Richard Butler...\nBUTLER: Thank you.\nZAHN: ... for your preview of what might happen at the U.N. later today.

And he's being investigated for hate crimes. The alleged shooter had numerous posts on social media trafficking in conspiracy theories about prominent Jewish figures. And according to law enforcement, he shouted anti-Semitic slurs when he opened fire on the congregation. And while this might be the deadliest attack on a Jewish target, it is not the only recent one. According to our next guest, anti-Semitic attacks have spiked over the past two years. George Selim is senior vice president for programs with the Anti-Defamation League. Thank you so much for joining us in the studio today.\nGEORGE SELIM: Good morning, Lulu. Thanks for having me.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: First, my condolences.\nGEORGE SELIM: Thank you.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: This is an incredibly painful moment, I know, for the community. Can you tell me your thoughts about what happened?\nGEORGE SELIM: Yeah. And just before I do that, I just want to express the most heartfelt and sincere condolences to the Jewish community, not just in the greater Pittsburgh area but really across the globe that is collectively mourning and suffering this morning.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Of course - so what is your reaction to this?\nGEORGE SELIM: So what we see here is really the result of a very tragic and unfortunate pattern and trend of the rise of extremism and anti-Semitism over the past several years. In calendar year 2017, we saw the largest single increase of anti-Semitic incidents in recent times. We saw nearly a 60 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017 over the previous year, 2016. In addition, we saw nearly a 90 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in K-12 classrooms in schools across the United States.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Before we get to why you think this is happening, when you say anti-Semitic incidents, what are you discussing?\nGEORGE SELIM: When we're talking about an anti-Semitic incident at a school, in a classroom, in a K-12, it's everything from the scrawling of a swastika on a bathroom wall to instances in - most recently in a Western state, where a student made very callous and cold references related to the death of Jews in the Holocaust as part of a Valentine's Day project. And so it really takes all different shapes and forms. Just three weeks ago here in Northern Virginia, I was at the Jewish Community Center in Fairfax where 19 swastikas were spray-painted on the side of, really, a community center where people come to exercise and hold community-based events. So it really takes all forms.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Why do you think this is happening now?\nGEORGE SELIM: I think a couple things. In recent years, there has been a normalization of hate and extremism both online and offline. The normalization of rhetoric and - from the highest levels of retweets of individuals like David Duke, from posts and restatements that are associated with white nationalists in this country - has almost become normal or part of a global discourse. In addition to that, the political divide in this country has become so toxic and, when combined with the normalization of this type of hate speech and anti-Semitism, has really led to a volatile atmosphere that we've seen play out just in the past week.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Also this week, a bomb was delivered to the home of George Soros, who is also Jewish. We've seen a lot of trafficking of conspiracy theories about him on mainstream conservative TV news, like Fox, even.\nGEORGE SELIM: Correct - and, in fact, ADL recently released some reporting that goes back and tracks a lot of the conspiracy theories. And they have their roots in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, as well. This is something that we've unfortunately seen play out both in the offline and online spaces. Some of the most vitriolic anti-Semitic attacks against Soros and others have really come out in the past year or two. And it's something that the ADL will remain constant and vigilant in combating on a day in and day out basis.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: We should also say this shooter was also trafficking in these conspiracy theories. He apparently believed that the caravan coming from Central America, which has been repeatedly discussed by the president and others, was being sponsored by Jewish organizations.\nGEORGE SELIM: Correct. One of the Jewish organizations that was mentioned in some of his posts was HIAS, an organization that does tremendous work on refugees and asylees, as well as the Anti-Defamation League. I mean, there were several posts and comments in his open-source social media. There were many victims in this case that were in Pittsburgh and beyond. And it's up to us as a global community of citizens and organizations to remain vigilant and push back against all forms of anti-Semitism, discrimination and bigotry. And we're committed to doing so.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: George Selim, senior vice president for programs of the Anti-Defamation League, thank you so much for coming in.\nGEORGE SELIM: Thank you."], "label": "S", "category": "TofuEval-MediaS", "additional_info": ""}

We are following breaking news this morning. It is a shocking story involving the blade runner, Olympic and Paralympic track superstar Oscar Pistorius. He is at the police station in south Africa right now after his model girlfriend was shot and killed inside his home. Police are saying a 26-year-old man has been arrested. They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature. Pistorius, who is a double amputee, reached the 400-meter semifinals in the London Games last year. He races with carbon blades because of a birth defect.\nBERMAN: To New York now where first it was calorie counts on menus, then trans fats, then mega soft drinks. Now, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is out to ban Styrofoam food packaging in stores. It's actually not Styrofoam technically, it's plastic foam. He's looking to ban that in stores and food restaurants. Bloomberg will unveil the plan today in his final State of the City speech.\nSAMBOLIN: And, boy, did you feel that breeze? Look at this. A boxer has suspended for allegedly taking a dive 13 seconds into a fight against former NFL defensive end Ray Edwards. Look at this, the phantom upper cut misses his much smaller opponent Nick “Turbo Tax“ Capes by about a foot. But he sells it, literally knocking himself off his own feet. Reports say “Turbo Tax“ --\nBERMAN: That is insane, I'm sorry. It is nowhere near him.\nSAMBOLIN: I know. But it looked right. So, if you're far away.\nBERMAN: Two miles away.\nSAMBOLIN: “Turbo Tax“ was a last-minute replacement for a couple of no-show boxers. North Dakota's fight governing body is reviewing that right there. It won't take long to jump into a conclusion dare, I say, right?\nBERMAN: Not a tough one to review. Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in “Road Warriors“.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The document discusses the ongoing debate on gun control in the US following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.", "reference_documents": ["BLITZER: Connecticut state police confirm today, just a little while ago indeed, that Adam Lanza fired what they call hundreds of bullet, hundreds, at the Sandy Hook Elementary school on Friday and you a number of weapons with him. We are live from the Lanza home, in just a moment with that investigation, standby for that. Also, we are awaiting the arrival of President Obama. He is due here in Newtown shortly. He is going to speak with the families of the 26 people, most of them elementary school children who were shot dead Friday morning. Stay with CNN for that. You will see the president live right here when he arrives. And of course, that interfaith vigil, the entirety, all of it we will bring it to you live. Let's go out to the home where Adam Lanza lived with his mother that home is also right now a crime scene because it appears in Lanza's mother was killed -- killed in the home before the shooting rampage over at the elementary school. CNN's Alison Kosik is joining us now from the Lanza home. Alison, the state police, Connecticut state police, they just gave us an update. For those of the viewers weren't watching CNN live, tell us the main points that the police made.\nALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The state police say that Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother, shooting her multiple times inside the house that is in this neighborhood where I'm standing right now. Police still have the street leading up to his house blocked off. You know, there hasn't been much activity since yesterday afternoon, up until about -- I would say a little over an hour ago, we watched about six police cars drive up several officials got out of their car, talked a built and then got back in the cars and drove off, we assume to Adam Lanza's house. Now, what we did learn throughout the day from state police is that their focus is really was on this school. And what they found was that four weapons were found at the school, three were found in the classroom a shotgun was found in Lanza's car that was parked outside the school. We also learned that Lanza mostly used a semiautomatic weapon called a Bushmaster inside the school to kill those 26 people inside the school. He had, as you said, he shot dozens of bullets and he had hundreds of unused ammunition as well, hundreds of bullets that were not even used. So, it was clear why the medical examiner came out yesterday and explained how Adam Lanza shot those 26 people multiple times, some of them, he shot, said the medical examiner, three to 11 times. It's clear that Lanza carrying that much ammunition on him was looking to cause the most destruction and death - Wolf.\nBLITZER: What a horrific, horrific crime. Alison, thank you so much. So, what happened Friday will make Monday, certainly, a huge challenge for so many families. Let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta who is here with us now. Posttraumatic stress disorder that is going to be a huge problem.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. And you know, we are used to talking about this in the context over adults but it can happen in children and it can happen quickly. I think that's two things people don't always realize. And you know, how the children behave now, how a lot of these things are implemented that you've been talking about with people over the last couple of days, is going to make a big difference, if certain conversations had had. If special care is taken to make sure that children are sleeping well, for example. They are going to be able to cope much better in the long runs. So, you can predict, you know, certain likelihood of success in terms of that coping by what's happening the next few days.\nBLITZER: We think of posttraumatic stress disorder, troops coming home from Afghanistan or Iraq. This is obviously very different than that. But, what are the symptoms? What should we be looking forward to? This is a very serious illness.\nGUPTA: In adults, you know, you think about things like hyper vigilance, difficulty sleeping, very quick and almost hasty reaction. In children, it can be very different. Sometimes don't verbalize it hard late all, changes in how they play. They may, in fact, start playing, you know, toy guns or something like that if they didn't before. They can have regression. So, a 6-year-old can start acting like a younger child, for example. And again, just paying attention to those things and not sort of glossing over, obviously don't want to provide graphic details, make sure you are having conversations. Tomorrow, kids go back to school. They don't know about what happened yet, they probably will by tomorrow.\nBLITZER: I'm sure they will. And if their parents didn't tell them, teachers might tell them or their classmates would tell them.\nGUPTA: Social media.\nBLITZER: Yes. They will hear about. And Sanjay is going to be with us throughout the night. We are awaiting the president of the United States. He is coming here to Newtown to bring some comfort to the families, the first responders. Also, he will participate in the interfaith vigil that will be taking place here in Connecticut.

Reports say “Turbo Tax“ --\nBERMAN: That is insane, I'm sorry. It is nowhere near him.\nSAMBOLIN: I know. But it looked right. So, if you're far away.\nBERMAN: Two miles away.\nSAMBOLIN: “Turbo Tax“ was a last-minute replacement for a couple of no-show boxers. North Dakota's fight governing body is reviewing that right there. It won't take long to jump into a conclusion dare, I say, right?\nBERMAN: Not a tough one to review. Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in “Road Warriors“.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour.

Just minutes ago, Argentina lost to Croatia three nail. That would make it extremely difficult for Argentina to advance out of their group. On the pitch today, France beat Peru, one nail. Yay. Which moves them into the knockout stage of the World Cup. Russia and Uruguay, so far, are the only other teams to advance. Russia's success certainly is a surprise. They came into the cup as the lowest rated team in the tournament. They have something called a home advantage though, I think Fred Pleitgen has been following the Russian national team and he's in Moscow. Fred.\nFREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hala, we visited their training camp earlier today and what we saw there was a very confident team, obviously bolstered by those two win that they got and a team that believes that they could do great things at the World Cup. And so now does this nation. Here's what we saw.\nPLEITGEN: It's not often that you see Russians this emotional. But the country's been in a football frenzy ever since the World Cup started. Thanks to Russia's Cinderella squad, a team most experts thought would fail miserably, but has outscored its opponents Eight to one so far. Defender Andrei Semyonov told me the team always believed in itself. Nobody believed in us, he says, now everyone does and they're starting to put medals on us. But we don't look at it. We studied our opponents really well and predicted everything. But few observers could have predicted their success. Russia is the lowest ranked team at the World Cup. Wouldn't have even qualified if they weren't the host nation. And many feared the mood at the World Cup would sour and the home team performed poorly. Now, the squad, led by striker Artem Dzyuba is on a roll. Team Russia has already proved all of its critics wrong, well, in all of its matches and already qualifying for the next round. And now both this nation and this team believe they can do great things at the FIFA 2018 World Cup. And with a successful squad, Russians are embracing their nation's role as hosts of the tournament. Striker Fyodor Kudryashov telling me, home field advantage has also helped elevate the team's performance. The fans are the 12th player on the field for us, he said. We feel their overwhelming support and our team goes forward. If there is a knock on the Russians, it's that they haven't played any of the really strong teams so far. But for now, Russia is enjoying the winning streak, hoping their World Cup fairy tale doesn't end any time soon.\nPLEITGEN: And, Hala, of course the next game they have will be against the stronger team, it's against Uruguay. And after that, of course, we get to the knockout stages and it's really going to be there that the Russians are going to show whether they are for real or not, Hala.\nGORANI: Yes, we will be watching.

It wasn't Demetrus.\nDOLAN: It was not him.\nBERMAN: They blew it. Someone -- either the state of the federal government blew it. And, Demetrus, this is an important point I want to get to before I bring Van in. How have you lived your life in the years since you have been released from prison?\nDEMETRIUS ANDERSON, COULD BE SENT BACK TO PRISON OVER CLERICAL ERROR: Like an American, law abiding citizen, doing everything right, working, gainfully employed, involved in my community, involved in my church -- found a church home. Just doing everything that I was supposed to do.\nBERMAN: Now, Van Jones, I want to bring you into this conversation because I think you all saw this story, like so many of us did, in the New Haven papers and in the Yale papers. You look at this and you think this runs counter to the idea of the justice, in quotation marks, system that we have in place.\nVAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I mean, absolutely. The whole point of the corrections system is to correct people. How can you say at this point 13 years later this man needs correction when he's done everything right? As best we can tell, he hasn't -- he doesn't even have an overdue library book. He's living better than me. He's living better than you. He's doing all the things you want someone to do. And if you're going to say this person, after 13 years of doing nothing wrong, of rebuilding his life, has to go back and do -- and do time, you have literally millions of other people who are out here who are supposed to do the right thing. What's to say that in five years, 10 years, 20 years, somebody's going to go back through the sock drawer and find something to put them back in jail? This doesn't make any sense. When somebody has actually rehabilitated themselves, that's the whole point. He's already done time for this crime and he should get credit for that. And he's -- he should get more credit for 13 years out of trouble. You know the statistics. When people come home from prison, the vast majority, unfortunately, wind up back in trouble very quickly. He has not been back in trouble for 13 years. The only trouble he is in now is because of a bizarre clerical error that could destroy his life.\nBERMAN: And, Van, you worked with Jared Kushner at the White House on criminal justice reform and prison reform. Do you intend to reach out personally to the White House to see if the president will get involved?\nJONES: I have already done so. And we'll see what happens. Here's the deal. I'm going to personally ask President Trump to do something. I'm going to ask everybody I know in the White House to do something. But I think everybody in America should get involved in this case. This is the kind of stuff that's so demoralizing and debilitating for people who are trying -- hey, listen, you -- let me talk about a role model. This is a guy that everybody coming out of prison hopes they will be. You don't grab your role model and throw your role models in jail. You should put your role models on your shoulders and parade them around. And so I'm going to ask, but, you know, also, cut50.org is doing something. I'm a part of the reformalliance.com. We are getting involved. Please reach out, help us make this a big issue. It's very rare, obviously, for the president to get involved in something like this, but we think the judges involved should give him credit for time served. We think the president should get involved. We think everybody should get involved.\nBERMAN: Demetrus, you have an April 4th court date.\nANDERSON: Correct.\nBERMAN: And this is very soon. You could end up back in federal prison in a week. Are you scared?\nANDERSON: I'm very scared. I'm very scared.\nBERMAN: What do you think is going to happen?\nANDERSON: I'm optimistic that justice will prevail. I still have faith in the judicial system. So I'm just praying and, you know, leaning on my faith that this could be, you know, vindicated.\nBERMAN: Well, Demetrus Anderson, Mike Dolan, thank you very much for being with us.

He is Minnesota's new senator -- that declared today, after a very long and contentious race. Let's take a quick listen to Al Franken at the mike.\nAL FRANKEN, WINNER OF MINNESOTA SENATE RACE: I'm thrilled and honored by the faith that Minnesotans have placed in me. I'm also humbled, not just by the closeness of this election, but by the enormity of the responsibility that comes with this office. We have a lot of work to do in Washington, but that's why I signed up for the job in the first place. When we started this campaign way back in February of 2007, I said that Americans have never backed away from tough challenges and Minnesotans have always led the way. Working with our fantastic senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to fight hard to make quality health care accessible and affordable to all Minnesotans, to make sure that our kids have an education that prepares them for a 21st century economy, to make Minnesota the epicenter of a new, renewable energy economy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil, to restore our standing in the world and put people to work here at home. To those Minnesotans who worked for me, volunteered for me, voted for me, I can't tell you how grateful I am. When you win an election this close, you know that not one bit of effort went to waste. And to those who devoted their time and energy to supporting Senator Coleman, I can only imagine how hard these past months have been. But no matter whether you voted for me or for Senator Coleman or for Senator Barkley or whether you voted at all, I want the people of Minnesota to know that I'm ready to work for all of you, that I'm committed to being a voice for all Minnesotans in the U.S. Senate. I know there's been a lot of talk about the fact that when I'm sworn in, I'll be the 60th member of the Democratic Caucus. But that's -- that's not how I see it. The way I see it, I'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic senator, I'm going to Washington to be the second senator from the State of Minnesota. And that's how I'm going to do this job.\nMALVEAUX: Minnesota's new senator, Al Franken, saying he is ready to go to work for his state. I want to bring in own Gloria Borger to kind of give us a lay of the land here. Obviously, it's a race that everybody has been following for quite some time. This is the next step now. What -- what does this mean for -- for the Democrats now that they have a larger majority?\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it means that they've got 60 seats, which would give them a filibuster-proof majority. But that's assuming that Democrats, and two Independents who we include in that, would agree on everything which is, of course, a large assumption that is not necessarily true.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: But, of course, they'll take every vote they can get at this point. Don't forget, this has been a hotly contested fight over these last eight months -- very divisive, splitting the parties in the Senate, leaving the State of Minnesota unrepresented. And so I think that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are kind of breathing a sigh of relief that it's -- that it's finally over, no matter how it was decided.\nMALVEAUX: Do you think it helps the Obama administration and the president pushing forward some of the things that have been so difficult for him, whether it's energy or health care?\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: Obviously...\nBORGER: Yes. Sure. I think it does. I mean, look, a vote is a vote is a vote. And I think Al Franken's politics are clearly more on the liberal side. So he would be more likely to go along with Barack Obama on things like climate change, on things like health care reform, than somebody like Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who's much more of a moderate who he may lose on certain votes.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: So I think that they would look at Franken as much more dependable.\nMALVEAUX: OK. Gloria Borger making sense of all of this. Thank you so much.\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: One of Michael Jackson's prized acquisitions was the rights to a vast Beatles music library.

The U.S. flag raised above the American embassy in Havana for the first time in 54 years. The U.S. and Cuba marking their resumption of diplomatic relations. But what happens now between the two countries? Joining me from Houston, CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, and in New York, Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, whose father Arthur Schlesinger worked in and wrote extensively about the Kennedy White House. Good to see both of you.\nDOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Thank you.\nSTEPHEN SCHLESINGER, ADJUNCT FELLOW, CENTURY FOUNDATION: Nice to see you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. So, Stephen, to you first. You know, what was that moment like for you, and did your dad ever talk about possibly seeing that kind of day, or that day happening, like what we saw yesterday?\nSCHLESINGER: I think he always wanted this day to happen. I don't think he would have realized it was going to take another 50 years. You know, it's quite remarkable. Ten presidents I believe have been in office since the embargo was instituted against Cuba. Finally, we have a president who made a breakthrough and it's a very impressive turnaround, and I think it will pay very much dividends, both with our relationship with Cuba as well as with the entire Latin American community.\nWHITFIELD: And so, Douglas, you know, this ceremony was full of symbolism, you know, from the U.S. Marines involved 54 years ago, taking the flag down, to now being the ones to help raise the flag. Apparently the cane that Secretary of State, you know, Kerry was walking on also had its significance there. How important was this moment to set a tone, so to speak, of how these two countries will be working together this day forward?\nBRINKLEY: Well, it's a very important tone-setting moment for John Kerry. It's one of the high watermarks of his tenure as secretary of state. Barack Obama will most likely get very high marks in history for kind of healing U.S.-Cuban relations. But we've got to be cautious here. Embassies can open and they can close. We had an embassy in Venezuela, in Caracas, running and then we shut it down. We'll have to see. We're not -- the friendship with the United States and Cuba is not ironclad at this juncture. There's still human rights issues. And if we ever find out that Cuba is in some ways sponsoring terrorism against the United States, things could dissolve. But for the moment, as Stephen Schlesinger said, this is a very healing moment after this many decades of the United States and Cuba at each other's throats. It looks like now a friendship is blooming.\nWHITFIELD: And blooming in what way do you see, Stephen? Because yes, unfinished business. We're still talking about, you know, an embargo that has yet to be lifted. It takes an act of Congress in order for that to happen. But what do you see next in the short term as opposed to the long term?\nSCHLESINGER: Well, I think there are going to be a series of small steps. I think Doug is quite right that -- you know, Cuba is not going to change overnight. In fact, it may not change for years. So the small steps are important. I think right now Secretary Kerry has been talking about some of them. For example, dealing with narcotics interdiction, or the environment, or issues of financial transactions or agriculture or telecommunications. All those issues are pretty straightforward and can be dealt with in a bilateral basis. But when you get into the issues of human rights, the settlement of expropriated property of Cubans and Americans, and issues of democracy, it's -- you're talking about a much longer-term situation.\nWHITFIELD: And then, Douglas, you know, just listening to the ceremony and listening to the -- whether it be the poet or even Secretary Kerry, some beautiful, you know, words that were being used. And when using language like, you know, as two peoples who are no longer enemies or rivals, but neighbors playing the Cuban national anthem first, and then later playing, you know, the U.S. national anthem. In what way do you see those as, you know, significant moves in order to really kind of thaw the ice?\nBRINKLEY: Well, I think the Cuban people and the American people have a shared rich history. And so one of the ways that the ice thawing is going to happen are cultural exchanges. Students going down to Cuba now. People going to do tourism. I went down to Cuba just to see the sight of the Bay of Pigs invasion. And went to see where Theodore Roosevelt's, you know, history down there. It's an amazing place, Havana. So I think the influx of American tourists going to Cuba is going to be quite remarkable. And when people start talking and dialoguing, sharing music, food, it's a chance for these two countries to get much closer. And also Fidel Castro is on his last legs, so to speak. And Raul Castro has shown more of an -- shown signs that he liked to get along with the United States. So for some people that remember the Cuban missile crisis, this is really a moment to celebrate when tensions are at an all-time low right now.\nWHITFIELD: Yes, neither of the Castros were there, but, you know, their aura, indeed.\nWHITFIELD: You know, is certainly in the vicinity.\nBRINKLEY: Yes.\nWHITFIELD: Stephen Schlesinger and Douglas Brinkley, thanks to both of you.

Other news we're following, dozens of Palestinians were killed today during protests in Gaza along the border with Israel. The demonstrations were aimed at the United States' opening a new embassy in Jerusalem, moving the new embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations says today's violence means there's no chance at peace. Let's get perspective from the Palestinians right now. Joining us, Ambassador Husam Zomlot. He's the head of the Palestinian authorities' delegation to the United States. Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much for joining us. Give us immediate reaction, if you can, to what the latest developments are, the impact of the U.S. moving the embassy, and what it means for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?\nAMB. HUSAM ZOMLOT, DIRECTOR, PLO DELEGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES: Just the U.S. administration has gave up on the peace process and its role as a mediator international towards achieving the internationally endorsed two-state solution. And it also means the U.S. has gave in for the voices of extremism, for the voices we'll see a zero-sum game, the fanatics, politically speaking. It was telling today that the ones who opened the ceremony of moving the U.S. embassy are religious leaders of the Christian Zionists who interpret politics and legality and world map from a very contested, to say the least, religious implications. This is not only encouraging Israel to cross the line. It's very encouraging to Israel to cross the line towards Armageddon and the end-of-time prophecy.\nBLITZER: Ambassador, are you at all, Mr. Ambassador, in touch with Trump administration officials? They keep saying they're about to release their peace plan, Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, and they still have hope for the two-state solution, Israel alongside a new state of Palestine. Have you had conversations with these American officials?\nZOMLOT: We don't know what they're talking about, really. We don't know. Peace is a very firm vision by the U.S. That vision has been drawn by all previous administrations, with the 1968 borders, establishing a sovereign state with each in the U.S. capital. The U.S. law is very clear. It was presented in 1991 by former administrator, James Baker. It is very clear. The U.S. intervention and vision is about Israel's occupation, implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions and respecting them in Jerusalem, never recognizing Israel's control of annexations. So what the U.S. administration has done is reneging on these promises and violating international law. There is a U.N. Security Council resolution that the U.S. voted for and that presents any state from moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And also the U.S. has stated that Jerusalem is outside the negotiating table. You know it, Wolf, very well. You have been there for many decades. But Jerusalem is the heart of the two states solution --\nBLITZER: Let me just interrupt, Ambassador, because they say they're not necessarily concluding all final status of all parts of Jerusalem. Yes, the U.S. is moving the embassy to west Jerusalem, but they're not completely ruling out the possibility of the Palestinians having control of parts of east Jerusalem and having a U.S. embassy in east Jerusalem for the new Palestinian state. When you hear that from the administration, what do you think?\nZOMLOT: No, I only have it from you now. Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people. It's not even the capital of Israel. As I said earlier, a clear religious interpretation of international relations and legal matters on one hand. On the other hand, there was a reason why all previous American presidents, from President Truman to President Obama, why they decided not to move the embassy. They knew, by doing so, you actually remove the U.S. from the role of the mediator and dictate the terms of reference and dictate the outcome of Jerusalem being an issue. Of course, we would be fine if the U.S. has -- when there are two embassies after reaching a peace agreement. Before that, it is -- it will only be seen as urgent on the Palestinians. President Trump himself says removing the Jerusalem from the table, taking it off the table. And then they wanted to remove the administration off the table that services the refugees. And then they are not even criticizing or condemning the illegal settlement expansion, which has been the major obstacle on the part of the two-state solution. And they are not even criticizing or condemning the murder by Israeli forces of the Palestinian peaceful demonstrators. So the bottom line, what peace process this administration is talking about? We believe that peace --\nZOMLOT: -- can be found now in the international community, in a multilateral forum. Peace can only be found based on legality, based on politics, not based on ideology, and some very twisted religious interpretations of reality.\nBLITZER: Ambassador Zomlot, let's see what this -- if they do release a plan, the Trump administration, what specifically it spells out. We'll continue our conversations. Ambassador Zomlot, thanks so much for joining us.\nZOMLOT: Thank you.\nBLITZER: We're going to hear from the White House about these deadly protests in Gaza, along the border with Israel in a few minutes.

Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here.

The television icon, “Jeopardy!“ host Alex Trebek, he's hosted that show for nearly 35 years. Announcing in public, with a video, that he's been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer.\nHARLOW: He is 78 years old, and he posted this moving message to fans on Wednesday, saying he will fight this.\nALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY!: I'm going to fight this. And I'm going to keep working. And with the love and support of my family and friends, and with the help of your prayers, also, I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease. Truth told? I have to. Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host “Jeopardy!“ for three more years, so help me.\nHARLOW: Oh. We all want to help him. With us now is our senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. He's such a staple in so many American households, living rooms, every evening. But you look at the numbers, you know? I think a statistic I read, 95 percent of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer die. Why?\nELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. I mean, the numbers really are so sobering. So, Poppy, what that number is, is that if you look at people with pancreatic cancer that's stage IV, so advanced cancer that's spread to distant parts of the body, five years after that diagnosis, only three percent of them are still alive. Those are not great numbers. Now, the American Cancer Society makes a point of saying, “Look, this -- you can't predict what's going to happen to any one person.“ And so obviously we are all praying and wishing Alex Trebek the best. But those are sort of the average, the average statistics that talk about what typically happens.\nSCIUTTO: Now, there are folks who survive. And some famous folks who survive, RBG survived pancreatic cancer. And those are hopeful stories, but you don't want it to give undue hope. What are the treatment options that make that more likely?\nCOHEN: Right. So, Jim, what they really try to focus on is chemotherapy for this disease. And doctors are very clear, they're not thinking about curing it at this stage. Really, what they're thinking of is slowing the progression and keeping the patient as comfortable as possible.\nTEXT: Pancreatic Cancer: Most patients are older than 45; Nearly 90 percent are older than 55; Average age of diagnosis is 71\nCOHEN: So mainly, that's chemotherapy. Some patients do get surgery. But it's not the kind of surgery that we hear of, for example, for a lump in a woman's breast, where you're hoping to remove all of it. They don't usually remove all of it because by the time pancreatic cancer is diagnosed, typically is has spread pretty far and it's really impossible to remove all of it.\nHARLOW: So it would all -- I mean, as you noted, the key reason here, why it's so deadly is because of the lack of symptoms, right? It's not like some of the other cancers where you have these symptoms. So it's almost as though if there were something to make it more symptomatic, it would be so helpful.\nCOHEN: Right. It actually would be better, ironically, if people felt sick. But people often don't feel sick at the beginning stages, or at the stage where pancreatic cancer is diagnosed.\nTEXT: Pancreatic Cancer in the\nU.S.: Fourth leading cause of death from cancer; Around 56,770 new cases will be diagnosed this year; Estimated 45,750 people will die from this cancer this year\nCOHEN: So they have pancreatic cancer, it's spread, but they often feel OK. And so the first signs are often things like jaundice or unexplained weight loss, or, oddly enough, itching is also another sign. But, you know, by the time these signs show up, usually the pancreatic cancer has spread. And there are some other reasons why it's so difficult to treat this disease, and why it is so deadly. One of them is that the pancreas is, it's way in there. It is deep in the middle of your abdomen. The organ itself doesn't have any kind of capsule around it, so it really spreads quite quickly.\nHARLOW: Elizabeth Cohen, thank you for reporting --\nCOHEN: Thanks.\nHARLOW: -- this.

Fifteen minutes past the hour. We are following breaking news this morning. It is a shocking story involving the blade runner, Olympic and Paralympic track superstar Oscar Pistorius. He is at the police station in south Africa right now after his model girlfriend was shot and killed inside his home. Police are saying a 26-year-old man has been arrested. They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature. Pistorius, who is a double amputee, reached the 400-meter semifinals in the London Games last year. He races with carbon blades because of a birth defect.\nBERMAN: To New York now where first it was calorie counts on menus, then trans fats, then mega soft drinks.

Bloomberg will unveil the plan today in his final State of the City speech.\nSAMBOLIN: And, boy, did you feel that breeze? Look at this. A boxer has suspended for allegedly taking a dive 13 seconds into a fight against former NFL defensive end Ray Edwards.

Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in “Road Warriors“.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs.

I'm Michele Norris.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And I'm Melissa Block.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: President Obama is looking for ways to cut the budget. Yesterday, his former rival for the presidency, Senator John McCain, suggested he look no further than the White House lawn.\nMICHELE NORRIS, Host: Your helicopter is now going to cost as much as Air Force One. I don't think that there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers enormous amount of money.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And the president didn't disagree.\nP: The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me.\nP: Of course, I've never had a helicopter before.\nP: You know, maybe I've been deprived, and I didn't know it. But I think it is an example of the procurement process gone amuck.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And joining us to talk about this pricey helicopter is Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Tom, what's the history here?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, this all started after the September 11th attacks. White House officials went to the Pentagon and said, listen, the president needs a better helicopter, one that can protect him in a better way, and also one where he can have better communications, talk with anyone in the world from his helicopter.\nTOM BOWMAN: And also, the current fleet is almost 40 years old, started flying during Gerald Ford's administration back in the mid-'70s, and they are getting to the end of their lifespan. They're looking at 2017, and that will be the end of these helicopters.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: What else do they want this new helicopter to do?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, I just talked with Loren Thompson. He's a defense analyst. He knows a lot about this program. And here's his list of what they want it to have.\nD: Many of the things that are carried on the presidential helicopter are secret. However, what we do know is that it has extensive self-protection capabilities against surface-to-air missiles; that it has hundreds of pounds of very secret communications equipment so the president can stay in touch with foreign leaders where there's nuclear forces and so on; that it has a kitchen, it has a bathroom, it has seating for 14 people, and it has a multiperson crew.\nTOM BOWMAN: Now, it also has to be small enough to land in that tight confinement of the White House grounds. And the other thing, they want it to go farther. The current helicopter goes maybe 150 miles before it has to refuel. This one, they want to go 300 miles in the event of a nuclear attack.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And meantime, this helicopter - fleet of helicopters is over budget and overdue.\nTOM BOWMAN: That's right. What happened is they kept adding requirements to it. They want it to be able to prevent a missile attack, better communications and so forth. Even the seats had to be able to take nine G's in case it drops out of the sky, and it can protect people. And they've built five of these already, and the next line of 23 will have an even more equipment. And there's talk about adding a new engine to compensate for the added weight.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Why do they need 28?\nTOM BOWMAN: It's not only the president who will use these but also the vice president, some of the top leaders, Defense Secretary Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And also, when the president goes around the country or overseas, they'll bring the helicopter along with him.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Now, when Senator John McCain says this is more expensive than Air Force One, is he right?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, he is. In 1990, when they procured the two Air Force One planes, it was a total cost of $650 million, so roughly $325 million each. But a better comparison might be the F22 fighter, the Air Force's most sophisticated jet, and that cost roughly the same as one of these helicopters - around $400 million.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Well, what happens now? And Barack Obama said this is a procurement process run amock. Do they scrap it? What do they do?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, it's a good question. Now, they have five now in flight testing. And they said Obama or someone else might be able to fly this in the next year and a half or so. So the question is, will they build the additional 23 with this added equipment? We don't know the answer to that yet. But the one thing we do know is the current fleet of helicopters is getting old, and they need some replacement.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Okay.

Stay on top of this story, update you with more. But we're also following some other new developments in the presidential race. Hillary Clinton this afternoon slammed what she called Donald Trump's casual inciting of violence saying his remarks about Second Amendment people crossed the line. But Trump is on the attack as well today. He says newly disclosed e-mails reveal what Trump calls a pay-for-play scheme involving the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. The campaign strongly denies any wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton. Let's bring in our senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny. He's got more on the -- on this e-mail story that has surfaced. What is the latest, Jeff?\nJEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, the Clinton campaign is denying that there was any impropriety between the secretary of state and any of these friends and donors. But this latest group of e-mail really shines the light on how closely connected all of the contributors and old friends of the Clintons' actually were with the State Department. And, Wolf, frankly it's the last thing that the campaign wants to be talking about now. They prefer to keep the focus on Donald Trump.\nZELENY (voice-over): Old e-mails causing new trouble tonight for Hillary Clinton. As she campaigns in Iowa, a new batch of messages from her time as secretary of state is raising fresh questions about the influence and access donors to the Clinton family's charitable foundation had on the State Department. The e-mails released Tuesday after conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch filed suit. It's adding new fuel to a controversy hanging over her campaign.\nCLINTON: I know people have raised questions about my e-mail use as secretary of state. And I understand why.\nZELENY: In one exchange, a long time aide to President Clinton, Doug Band, lobbied Secretary Clinton's aides to find a job at the State Department for someone who was important to take care of. The name of the person Band is trying to help is redacted. He made the request to Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, two top Hillary Clinton aides who remain among her closest advisers. Abedin reassures Band personnel has been sending him options. There is no indication he was a donor. It's the latest chapter in a long saga over the Clinton Foundation and her e-mails particularly her decision to use a private server as secretary of state. The FBI did not file charges but it's taken a toll on her credibility.\nCLINTON: And I want to be as transparent as possible.\nZELENY: In another e-mail, Band tries to connect a Clinton Foundation donor, a Lebanese Nigerian billionaire, with the State Department's substance person on Lebanon. “As you know, he's a key guy there and to us is loved in Lebanon. Very important,“ Band wrote. Donald Trump is seizing on the disclosure calling it an example of a cozy and corrupt relationship between Clinton donors and the State Department.\nTRUMP: It's called pay-for-play. And some of these were really, really bad and illegal.\nZELENY: A Clinton campaign spokesman brushed aside the criticism, saying, “Hillary Clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the Clinton Foundation.“ Campaigning in Iowa today, Clinton kept her focus on Trump.\nCLINTON: Yesterday we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that crossed the line.\nZELENY: Her campaign is raising money from his incendiary comments Tuesday, asking supporters to have her back.\nTRUMP: If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know.\nZELENY: Trump's rhetoric is turning more Republicans against him. The Clinton campaign unveiling a new list of GOP supporters, including former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, former director of the National Intelligence John Negroponte, and former Connecticut congressman Chris Shays.\nCHRISTOPHER SHAYS (R), FORMER CONNECTICUT REPRESENTATIVE: I'm going to vote for Hillary. I didn't -- I didn't imagine that, but it's -- frankly it's become an easy decision. Trump lost me months ago.\nZELENY: Now Hillary Clinton is doing extensive outreach to Republicans, including, Wolf, writing an op-ed in the Salt Lake City newspaper, reaching out to Mormon voters there, talking about religious freedom, and how Donald Trump simply isn't acceptable. And, Wolf, she's headed to Michigan tonight. She'll be giving an economic address tomorrow. Right in Mitt Romney's old backyard. Those Reagan Democrats she's after. The Clinton campaign clearly wants to put this e-mail controversy aside and focus back on the economy where she's leading Donald Trump in most polls.\nBLITZER: Jeff Zeleny, reporting, thanks very much.

He is Minnesota's new senator -- that declared today, after a very long and contentious race. Let's take a quick listen to Al Franken at the mike.\nAL FRANKEN, WINNER OF MINNESOTA SENATE RACE: I'm thrilled and honored by the faith that Minnesotans have placed in me. I'm also humbled, not just by the closeness of this election, but by the enormity of the responsibility that comes with this office. We have a lot of work to do in Washington, but that's why I signed up for the job in the first place. When we started this campaign way back in February of 2007, I said that Americans have never backed away from tough challenges and Minnesotans have always led the way. Working with our fantastic senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to fight hard to make quality health care accessible and affordable to all Minnesotans, to make sure that our kids have an education that prepares them for a 21st century economy, to make Minnesota the epicenter of a new, renewable energy economy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil, to restore our standing in the world and put people to work here at home. To those Minnesotans who worked for me, volunteered for me, voted for me, I can't tell you how grateful I am. When you win an election this close, you know that not one bit of effort went to waste. And to those who devoted their time and energy to supporting Senator Coleman, I can only imagine how hard these past months have been. But no matter whether you voted for me or for Senator Coleman or for Senator Barkley or whether you voted at all, I want the people of Minnesota to know that I'm ready to work for all of you, that I'm committed to being a voice for all Minnesotans in the U.S. Senate. I know there's been a lot of talk about the fact that when I'm sworn in, I'll be the 60th member of the Democratic Caucus. But that's -- that's not how I see it. The way I see it, I'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic senator, I'm going to Washington to be the second senator from the State of Minnesota. And that's how I'm going to do this job.\nMALVEAUX: Minnesota's new senator, Al Franken, saying he is ready to go to work for his state. I want to bring in own Gloria Borger to kind of give us a lay of the land here. Obviously, it's a race that everybody has been following for quite some time. This is the next step now. What -- what does this mean for -- for the Democrats now that they have a larger majority?\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it means that they've got 60 seats, which would give them a filibuster-proof majority. But that's assuming that Democrats, and two Independents who we include in that, would agree on everything which is, of course, a large assumption that is not necessarily true.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: But, of course, they'll take every vote they can get at this point. Don't forget, this has been a hotly contested fight over these last eight months -- very divisive, splitting the parties in the Senate, leaving the State of Minnesota unrepresented. And so I think that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are kind of breathing a sigh of relief that it's -- that it's finally over, no matter how it was decided.\nMALVEAUX: Do you think it helps the Obama administration and the president pushing forward some of the things that have been so difficult for him, whether it's energy or health care?\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: Obviously...\nBORGER: Yes. Sure. I think it does. I mean, look, a vote is a vote is a vote. And I think Al Franken's politics are clearly more on the liberal side. So he would be more likely to go along with Barack Obama on things like climate change, on things like health care reform, than somebody like Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who's much more of a moderate who he may lose on certain votes.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: So I think that they would look at Franken as much more dependable.\nMALVEAUX: OK. Gloria Borger making sense of all of this. Thank you so much.\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: One of Michael Jackson's prized acquisitions was the rights to a vast Beatles music library.

Each will reflect the Ernestine Anderson Way honorary designation. Racine Anderson was a legendary American jazz and blues singer from Seattle Center Area and graduate of Garfield High School and Ernestine Anderson Place, a senior affordable housing complex, was constructed in 2012 on South Jackson Street between 20th Avenue South and 20th place south. So this designation will occur adjacent to that housing complex. I did not have an honor to hear Ernestine Anderson perform. She passed away at the age of 87 earlier this year. But her legacy certainly is impressive. One anecdote I read in her obituary talked about how she was born in Houston and moved to Seattle in high school , and her father came to Seattle looking for work, but also because he wanted to be on the West Coast. And Seattle is like a sleepy town where he could get his daughter away from the music scene. Little did he know that Garfield in the Central District at that time was just emerging, and she played a significant role in that. And her overlap with Quincy Jones and Ray Charles and other folks who were in the music scene in Seattle at that time were impressive. This is a great a great chance to honor one of the leaders in our community for so long and look forward to voting yes on this bill.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Rodney, for the comments. Alex, say a few words. No one else would. Casper and Brian, thank you for describing Ms.. Anderson's background. And many people have been around Seattle for decades and many are recent arrivals. And I just think it's critically important when we celebrate this kind of history is, as you described, she recorded over 37 albums in her lifetime and she was really celebrated as a jazz artists throughout the world when she attended Garfield High School. That's where she met Quincy Jones. And you have to talk publicly about Quincy was a classmate of my mother and father's at Garfield. High school. And so I've had the opportunity to sort of over the years, interface with Miss Anderson's family. And her daughter Yvonne was attending school with myself. She's part of some great history in Seattle with groups such as Bumps Blackwell and Buddy Catlett and, of course, Quincy Jones. And those folks, if you go to the Safeway on 23rd and in Madison, you'll see a picture of a group called Bumps Blackwell. That many folks. It was just one of the best jazz groups around. And Quincy Jones is in that picture. And my father is a saxophone player sitting right next to Quincy Jones. So it's quite extraordinary what talent has come out of this city. Quincy Jones described Ernestine his voice as, quote, honey at dusk, and he said that the world got a taste of her honey. And she performed in the Monterey Jazz Festivals at Carnegie Hall in the White House during the first inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower at the Kennedy Center. She toured Europe and had many concerts in London and New York. So again, quite a local treasure. In 1999, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer, Brian Lenker published a book I think many of you have heard of. It's called I Dream a World. And in that book, she he describes 75 women, African-American women who really changed America, Coretta Scott King, Sarah Vaughan, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks and our own Ernestine Anderson is in that book. So, so again, she's quite a legend. And I think as we preserved what's great in this city, I think part of that is actually preserving names like Reverend McKinney and Ernestine Anderson and others. So I'm very happy to support this resolution. You know the comments. Okay. So those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i, i, those opposed vote no. The ayes have it.

Our request today focused on a recent air quality concern with businesses located in City of Paramount, which are both only about a half mile away from District nine Long Beach neighborhoods. In October 2016, the South Coast Air Quality Management District began investigating two metal processing facilities in the city of Paramount after detecting hexavalent chromium, a potentially cancer causing metal.

I know that we have Weber Metals here in Long Beach and Paramount and a number of metal shops that are not necessarily hexavalent chromium emission emitters. And so we want to understand the difference between those two and understand where they where they are that are in Long Beach and close to Long Beach. So we want to understand that and we want to confirm and maybe you can answer this for us now, who is the lead agency that does evaluate potential potential impacts of air quality of businesses that surround Long Beach?\nSpeaker 3: Sure. So the US EPA establishes health based air quality standards that all states must achieve. And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.\nSpeaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.\nSpeaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry. So and it appears that ACME is is the lead on this.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And we have already engaged them, correct?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, that is correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And so when do we anticipate to have some report of the findings of that discussion back to city council?\nSpeaker 3: We think we can have something back to you in about 45 days.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Have we spoken with the City of Paramount as well?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Our office has been in contact with the city manager's office and Paramount.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So and so in 45 days, we'll have a report back. And can that include potential next steps if we do find that there is some impact along beach neighborhoods? Yes, certainly. Well, thank you very much.

Each will reflect the Ernestine Anderson Way honorary designation. Racine Anderson was a legendary American jazz and blues singer from Seattle Center Area and graduate of Garfield High School and Ernestine Anderson Place, a senior affordable housing complex, was constructed in 2012 on South Jackson Street between 20th Avenue South and 20th place south. So this designation will occur adjacent to that housing complex. I did not have an honor to hear Ernestine Anderson perform. She passed away at the age of 87 earlier this year. But her legacy certainly is impressive. One anecdote I read in her obituary talked about how she was born in Houston and moved to Seattle in high school , and her father came to Seattle looking for work, but also because he wanted to be on the West Coast. And Seattle is like a sleepy town where he could get his daughter away from the music scene. Little did he know that Garfield in the Central District at that time was just emerging, and she played a significant role in that. And her overlap with Quincy Jones and Ray Charles and other folks who were in the music scene in Seattle at that time were impressive. This is a great a great chance to honor one of the leaders in our community for so long and look forward to voting yes on this bill.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Rodney, for the comments. Alex, say a few words. No one else would. Casper and Brian, thank you for describing Ms.. Anderson's background. And many people have been around Seattle for decades and many are recent arrivals. And I just think it's critically important when we celebrate this kind of history is, as you described, she recorded over 37 albums in her lifetime and she was really celebrated as a jazz artists throughout the world when she attended Garfield High School. That's where she met Quincy Jones. And you have to talk publicly about Quincy was a classmate of my mother and father's at Garfield. High school. And so I've had the opportunity to sort of over the years, interface with Miss Anderson's family. And her daughter Yvonne was attending school with myself. She's part of some great history in Seattle with groups such as Bumps Blackwell and Buddy Catlett and, of course, Quincy Jones. And those folks, if you go to the Safeway on 23rd and in Madison, you'll see a picture of a group called Bumps Blackwell. That many folks. It was just one of the best jazz groups around. And Quincy Jones is in that picture. And my father is a saxophone player sitting right next to Quincy Jones. So it's quite extraordinary what talent has come out of this city. Quincy Jones described Ernestine his voice as, quote, honey at dusk, and he said that the world got a taste of her honey. And she performed in the Monterey Jazz Festivals at Carnegie Hall in the White House during the first inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower at the Kennedy Center. She toured Europe and had many concerts in London and New York. So again, quite a local treasure. In 1999, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer, Brian Lenker published a book I think many of you have heard of. It's called I Dream a World. And in that book, she he describes 75 women, African-American women who really changed America, Coretta Scott King, Sarah Vaughan, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks and our own Ernestine Anderson is in that book. So, so again, she's quite a legend. And I think as we preserved what's great in this city, I think part of that is actually preserving names like Reverend McKinney and Ernestine Anderson and others.

We work to pass a fire code in conjunction with the building code to ensure consistency in development standards. The fire code was last updated in 2016 and it's usually updated every three years. Last year, both the building code and the fire code updates were delayed due to the public health emergency. Just highlighting the major changes in the fire code. There are four sort of categories of major, major changes. One relates to our allowing alternative fuel vehicles on display inside buildings to maintain their battery connection in order to keep their safety systems active. A second change relates to the need for integrated testing systems in high rise buildings to assure fire protection and life safety systems work together in an integrated way as intended and are tested at least every ten years. Third relates to a need for mobile fueling of vehicles to allow allow for mobile fueling of vehicles in designated areas such as parking lots and only those parking lots that meet certain requirements.

Second? Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Herbold, you are the prime sponsor of the bill and are recognized in order to address this item. Thank you so much. As discussed earlier this morning in council briefings, this bill relates to both the Civil Service Commission and the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. Both entities have three members, one that's appointed by the mayor, one that's appointed by the council, and one that's elected by the relevant city employees for the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. That is police and fire employees for the Civil Service Commission. It is nonexempt employees who do not work for the mayor or council or civil service commission staff. Both entities are having elections this year and things are slightly delayed.\nSpeaker 2: By.\nSpeaker 0: COVID 19. So this legislation allows the city clerk to hold the elections in December rather than November. It allows for electronic ballots rather than only physical ballots, though the option of paper ballots will still remain, and the schedule changes only for 2020. And these elements are only included in the ordinance, not the Seattle Municipal Code. There are some municipal code changes and that is only related to eliminating out dated language in the municipal code related to the election process. And it allows the city clerk to modernize the election election process by rule in the future.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbals, are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Peterson, please.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, council president and thank you. Councilmember Herbold, a viewing public mind. I know, but during council briefing this morning, we talked a little bit about this particular council bill. And I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for clarifying and just want to point out to the public, the fiscal note does say that this legislation has contingent language to cover that. The Public Safety Civil Service Commission is because of the accountability ordinance from 2017, intended not to have any elected members in the future, so that this leaves open the possibility to implement that provision of the 2017 Accountability Police Accountability Ordinance, which I know several members on this Council were champions of that and authors of that. And so we, by passing this ordinance, are in no way signaling any sort of deviation from our commitment to implement the rest of that accountability ordinance, which which actually excluded employees from this commission. So thank you for clarifying that this morning.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank. Thanks so much, Casimir Peterson. Any other comments on the bill? Okay. Hearing. I appreciate the ongoing conversation here. I'm going to go ahead and ask the clerk to call the roll on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 2: Suarez i.\nSpeaker 0: Lewis.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 2: Morales I.\nSpeaker 0: Mosquera.

So this resolution supports the initiative. 1491. I'm sorry. Here. I have a lot of paperwork in front of me. And as you well know, 1491 is an initiative to the people of our state relative to, I say, urging voters to vote yes relative to a law that would suspend a person's access to firearms if there's documented evidence that an individual is threatening harm to themselves or others because of dangerous mental illness or a high risk of violent behavior. And if you look at the substance of the resolution itself, and I'm not at this point in the proceeding, I'm just describing the context. This is not my pro or con statement. I'm just describing the context of the resolution. And then I will ask for comments, either pro or con, but the University of California in 2014 I'm sorry, there are several incidents that have saddened our country that are described in the legislation itself, such as the incident in 2014, the University of California in Santa Barbara here in 2013 and Cafe Racer 2006. Jewish Federation of Seattle, the Seattle shooting. We can list the types of egregious behavior we've seen in this initiative. 1491 is modeled on the successful laws around the country and is based on a well-established Washington state system protection orders to fill the gaps in the system that allow people experiencing crisis or demonstrating violent behavior to possess and purchase firearms. So as described in the resolution, the contents are for the public safety of all people, including those who harm themselves. And at this point, I will move to pass Council Bill three. I will move to adopt Resolution 31701 and then I'll ask for comments after has been moved to adopt as their second. Okay. I'm sorry. 702i move to adopt resolution 31731702. Is there a second? Okay. Now, at this point, are there any comments regarding this resolution? So hearing then from my colleagues again, I'll just say it. Councilman Burgess, did you want to say a few words? Please do.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Council members, before you begin, I just want to make it clear as the rules that aren't known by many that the inclusion of our comments, we will hear comments from members of the public who wish to speak in opposition, and we will allow the same amount of time for those people as well as the rules require. Councilman Burgess.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much. This measure 1491, which we all get to vote on here in a few weeks at the November election, is another common sense measure around gun safety. The vast majority of gun violence incidents in the state of Washington and frankly, across the United States, almost three quarters of those cases involve suicide or unintentional shootings , what some people refer to as accidental shootings. And in many of those cases, members of families or close personal friends are often aware of the looming crisis that is being presented to a family. And so with the passage of this initiative in November, family members will be able to go before a court and petition for a protection order, which may include the seizure of firearms in the possession of someone who is at great risk. And I hope that my colleagues will join in supporting this measure, supporting initiative 1491, and that the people of Washington state will likewise support that initiative.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Burgess. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? I do have at least one person who may want to speak in opposition to this particular item. And Mr.. Mr.. Locke, did you wish to speak on this item, sir, at all dealing with the Firearm Initiative Measure 1491. Did you wish to speak to that? You had signed up on several lists? No. Well, let me call for any public comment. Are there any members of the public comment that would like to speak in opposition to this particular resolution or to initiative measure 1491? He? We do. Please come forward, ma'am. And, Amelia, can you make sure this is safe?\nSpeaker 4: I didn't think I was going to be talking on this issue today. But I am Cynthia Lynette, the author, the artist who has produced a body of work called The Gun Show. It will be passed around. I'm very concerned about this resolution that anybody, a family member can take somebody to court. And I don't care about taking away their guns, but then they're going to be required to go through some kind of psychiatric help. And you know what that means?\nSpeaker 5: That means psychotropic drugs. And we do not want them anymore.\nSpeaker 4: So if you could put something in here that says we are not going to give these people psychotropic drugs or require them to take it, then I might consider this. Otherwise, it is not good.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your words. Do any of my colleagues wish to provide any further comments on this resolution? Okay.

This council constable transfers of former substation property in the deluge neighborhood of Seattle from City Light to the Parks Department. Under state law, public utilities are financially distinct from the city, and so the property had to be sold at fair market value. In this case, the property was not part of Park's strategic plan, but the community wanted to maintain it as a greenspace. So the Delbridge Neighborhoods Development Association raised the money by winning grants to pay for it, and that menu is attached to the Council bill. I want to thank Dale Rich Neighborhoods Development Association for their work on behalf of their community and also thanks to City Light staff who as usual, have made sure to give the community the time they need to make the whole thing work.

The work that community members and our neighborhood district associations specifically I want to call out Willie Brown is fantastic in the vision for this property is really exciting as well. Not only will they be using the space for a natural wetland which will detail storm water runoff, alleviating flooding of neighborhood yards and driveways, but it will also provide a bio filtration of stormwater runoff before it enters Longfellow Creek. And then DDA will partner with Seattle Tilth and Nature Consortium and staff and students from Louisa Boren stem k through eight school to develop and manage the remaining part of the property as a permanent culture food forest. And this is really important for this community because Delbridge is a food desert. The land management system contains aspects of the native habitat with edible forest gardening and a children's garden will link classroom and field experience to educate local youth in environmental science and stewardship and atmosphere.

A comment. I correct myself. No vote, though. No vote. Thank you, Mr. President. So 553 this is actually a measure we are referring to the ballot. So for the hundreds of thousands of viewers at home, I thought it was important that we tell you why. We're sending you a question about the Denver preschool program to the ballot. You may remember that you voted last year to approve the Denver preschool tax for another decade, I believe. But what we do in our elections for sales taxes is we try to predict how much money the city is going to get, both from the tax and overall as a city. So we can tell the voters, according to TABOR. And in this case, we I think I'm looking at David, I think we got it right on the sales tax amount, but we were a little low in what the city would take in overall. And so what that means is we need your permission again, because we told you what we thought we were going to take in. We hope that you will tell us again that we should keep the money that we collected for the preschool and use it to get kids head start in life and get them learning their ABCs and safe and quality child care during their start before school. But this will be a vote tonight in our block vote. It appears to send this to you as voters. And so just wanted to make sure folks knew why. And we will need your support to make sure that preschool money keeps in the budget.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. You know what? Thank you so much, Councilman Kennedy, for for bringing that up. And we know that kids get a start in preschool, gives them a head start in first and second grade. And so that is data that is proof. So thank you so much for that. Okay.

My name's Kevin Kennedy. I'm the city treasurer. Madame Mayor. Happy belated birthday. Thank you. City Council. Just to give you a quick update on Wells Fargo, as the report indicates, we did sell the positions that we had in Wells Fargo as of June 30th. So the portfolio does not hold. Any Wells Fargo securities in it, which was the the direction we got from counsel. Last spring.\nSpeaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.\nSpeaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.\nSpeaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited. But taking one issue or out of that mix probably doesn't affect the portfolio in the long run.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any other questions from vice mayor?\nSpeaker 4: It's not really a question. I just wanted to say thank you to both you and Elena for your work on this. And, you know, I think that it's tremendous that not only did we say we were going to do something, but we've actually taken action and we did it in a way that was fiscally savvy for our city.

This legislation adopts amendments to the 2019 Annual Action Plan to detail how the city will spend approximately 8.9 million of dollars in federal funds allocated to the city through Housing and Urban Development for COVID response, including CBD funds, ESG and housing opportunities for people with AIDS or the Heart grant. These funds were appropriated by the Council through Ordinance of 126074 and 126084 passed in May. Funds have been allocated to the Human Services Department, Office of Housing and the Office of Economic Development to prevent, prepare and respond to the coronavirus. These funds will support emergency rental assistance, grant payments to small businesses and meal programs for people experiencing homelessness. In order to enter into grant agreements with HUD and to receive the funds, we have been directed to amend our most current annual action plans for these appropriations. You will note that we approved the 2020 Annual Action Plan in May. However, since the grant agreements for the 2020 Annual Action Plan have not yet been executed by Housing and Urban Development. The 2019 Annual Action Plan is still our current plan, and therefore we must send in that plan to receive these paired COVID emergency funds. Last week we held a public hearing on the legislation on Monday. Thank you to the public because the vote on that, this legislation is considered part of the budget rebalancing package. However, it is scheduled for a vote today because adoption of amendments to the annual action plans are required before these funds can be distributed.

I just want to highlight for folks, both in our renter communities as well as to the folks who are providing rental housing to to renters, that this amended plan clearly states that the 1.4 million that the council previously moved away from rental assistance towards shelter will be spent on rental assistance. This plan will help ensure that desperately needed resources for homelessness, prevention and rental assistance are restored. I think as we originally intended a couple weeks ago now.

I will address that first and then see if any of you colleagues have comments to add. Council Bill 119794. As I discussed in this morning's council briefing is related to the Seattle Parking Enforcement Officers Guild's Collective Bargaining Agreement. This council bill would authorize the execution of a negotiated union contract between the city of Seattle and that bargaining unit. This is a three year contract from January 1st, 2019 through December 31st, 2021, and includes approximately 105 regularly appointed city employees in the Seattle Police Department. The financial terms of this union contract are similar to those of the State Coalition's union contracts and include a retroactive 4% annual wage increase for 2019 and a 3.6% annual wage increase for 2020. The financial and non-financial terms in this collective bargaining agreement were considered and approved by the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee and are within those previously approved parameters. I'm happy to entertain any questions or hear any comments from any of my colleagues. Councilmember Peterson.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President Gonzalez, I appreciate.\nSpeaker 3: The hard work of our Labor Relations Policy Committee and the difficult decisions that you have to make.\nSpeaker 2: I do not serve on that particular committee of legislative and executive leaders who represent management and who negotiate the multitude of employment contracts.\nSpeaker 3: Impacting 12,000 city government workers.\nSpeaker 2: I carefully consider each contract on its own terms, and.\nSpeaker 3: At this moment in time, with the grim.\nSpeaker 2: Fiscal challenges our city.\nSpeaker 3: Government faces today, I'll be voting no on this particular contract for parking enforcement officers. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for those remarks. Just really quickly, I want to be just responsive to the extent that I can. We don't need to belabor the point, but this this particular contract, and based on the evaluation given to us by the city Budget Office, does not have dire or detrimental impacts on the projected deficit of the city of Seattle. I think that I and the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee, which include four other Council members and members of the executive team, carefully engaged with the city budget office to make sure that this was not only a high road employer contract, but also a contract that was fiscally responsible and within our existing means as a city and feel comfortable that the contract before us strikes the right balance and that in approving this contract, we will not be subjecting the city budget to to further pressure or crisis as a result of the the the contract. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting approval of this particular contract. Any other questions or comments, colleagues? Because remember Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Madam President. I do just want to signal that I will be voting in favor of ratifying this contract today. I think it's critical that as we go into what is going to be a very difficult a lot of very difficult conversations about the budget over the summer, in this fall, can we not lose sight of the fact that some of the most essential functions of government that we serve as a city are our first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and certainly the employees that are included under this contract that provide an essential law enforcement based mechanism that is really essential to maintaining the social contract that holds the city of Seattle together . This these are some of the services that we need to fight more than ever to make sure that we are maintaining adequately and that these are workers, that we are seeking to have measures in place to retain and encourage them to stay in our workforce. There's never been a more appropriate time, I think, to ratify a contract like this for this group of workers. I hope it sets a precedent that we try to make sure that we set a budget that not only delivers essential services, but really defines our values as a progressive city. And I think it really starts by making sure that we boldly stand by some of the workers doing really essential and critical work out there. That hasn't abated during this crisis. So I will be voting in favor of this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any other comments or questions on the bill? Hearing and seeing none.

But I just wanted to draw a little attention to this one. As chair of the Energy Committee, this litigation is for the construction of the Denny substation, which is a very large Seattle City Light project in the middle of the Cascade neighborhood, the residential neighborhood and several low income housing buildings are immediately adjacent to the construction site, and substations usually don't go in such dense, densely populated areas. But this one is an exception. I do know that City Light has done a lot of outreach so far to the community and has found ways in which to mitigate the potential impact of the construction of this project on the neighbors. And I support moving forward to the public hearing. Just wanted to highlight the hearing just in case somebody is listening and wants an opportunity to comment. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. So to repeat again, the hearing is July 35, 30 PM at the Bell Town Community Center. Any other questions or comments?

Each will reflect the Ernestine Anderson Way honorary designation. Racine Anderson was a legendary American jazz and blues singer from Seattle Center Area and graduate of Garfield High School and Ernestine Anderson Place, a senior affordable housing complex, was constructed in 2012 on South Jackson Street between 20th Avenue South and 20th place south. So this designation will occur adjacent to that housing complex. I did not have an honor to hear Ernestine Anderson perform. She passed away at the age of 87 earlier this year. But her legacy certainly is impressive. One anecdote I read in her obituary talked about how she was born in Houston and moved to Seattle in high school , and her father came to Seattle looking for work, but also because he wanted to be on the West Coast. And Seattle is like a sleepy town where he could get his daughter away from the music scene. Little did he know that Garfield in the Central District at that time was just emerging, and she played a significant role in that. And her overlap with Quincy Jones and Ray Charles and other folks who were in the music scene in Seattle at that time were impressive. This is a great a great chance to honor one of the leaders in our community for so long and look forward to voting yes on this bill.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Rodney, for the comments. Alex, say a few words. No one else would. Casper and Brian, thank you for describing Ms.. Anderson's background. And many people have been around Seattle for decades and many are recent arrivals. And I just think it's critically important when we celebrate this kind of history is, as you described, she recorded over 37 albums in her lifetime and she was really celebrated as a jazz artists throughout the world when she attended Garfield High School. That's where she met Quincy Jones. And you have to talk publicly about Quincy was a classmate of my mother and father's at Garfield. High school. And so I've had the opportunity to sort of over the years, interface with Miss Anderson's family. And her daughter Yvonne was attending school with myself. She's part of some great history in Seattle with groups such as Bumps Blackwell and Buddy Catlett and, of course, Quincy Jones. And those folks, if you go to the Safeway on 23rd and in Madison, you'll see a picture of a group called Bumps Blackwell. That many folks. It was just one of the best jazz groups around. And Quincy Jones is in that picture. And my father is a saxophone player sitting right next to Quincy Jones. So it's quite extraordinary what talent has come out of this city. Quincy Jones described Ernestine his voice as, quote, honey at dusk, and he said that the world got a taste of her honey. And she performed in the Monterey Jazz Festivals at Carnegie Hall in the White House during the first inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower at the Kennedy Center. She toured Europe and had many concerts in London and New York. So again, quite a local treasure. In 1999, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer, Brian Lenker published a book I think many of you have heard of. It's called I Dream a World. And in that book, she he describes 75 women, African-American women who really changed America, Coretta Scott King, Sarah Vaughan, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks and our own Ernestine Anderson is in that book. So, so again, she's quite a legend. And I think as we preserved what's great in this city, I think part of that is actually preserving names like Reverend McKinney and Ernestine Anderson and others.

Tesoro just had a strike, so prices jumped again, $0.30 in the last two weeks. And that all depends on what happens in the fracking industry and as the prices go up and down per barrel. But I think this is where we're going to see some loss in the next year, probably as well as HTL, who handles all of our sales tax. They also suggested that this might be the case. And then once again, we are still at the bottom of the chart as far as sales tax goes. The countywide tax, or this was another question that came up last time was 9%. In San Leandro, it's 9.25. Albany is 9.5 and else redo is 9.5. Those are all special taxes that their council along the voters represented and passed to get on to their ballots. We don't currently have that.

The second set of amendments actually incorporates two edits to memorialize and recognize in two separate places the work that Councilmember Suarez has spearheaded for an independent council consultant for Financial Review. The first edit adds a recital with language from the consultant funding request and the second notes Council's intent to review that council consultant work in Section two . And then the third amended language is to Section one. And it says specifically, in order for the council to potentially carry out review by the end of the year. The intent is to add context to this section regarding what the Council needs in order to have a chance to fulfill the goal of taking final action by the end of the year, as referenced in Section four.\nSpeaker 0: Very good, Councilmember.

All of the appropriate departments, Health and Human Services, Development Services, Police, Financial Management and Financial Management have reviewed the application and have provided their recommended conditions as contained in the hearing packet. The following recommended conditions on attachment A are of note from section two of the additional conditions. Section number one in that section is entertainment activities shall be restricted to no later than 11 p.m., Monday through Thursday and midnight Friday through Sunday. Entertainment can begin at 12 noon daily. The business applied, requesting entertainment to be permitted from nine or 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. seven days a week. And the Long Beach Police Department recommended the restricted conditions to balance community concerns and the businesses needs. Section number six or item number six.

Hours of sales. Hours of sales of alcohol shall be limited to the hours when meals are available. In this particular situation, this condition was found to be too restricted after additional consideration of the communications from the business owner.

This ordinance would direct to the Seattle Department of Transportation to manufacture, install and maintain honourary signs at the intersections of South Jackson Street and 20th Avenue, South South Jackson Street and 20th Place, south South Jackson Street and 22nd Avenue, South and South Jackson Street and 23rd Avenue South . Each will reflect the Ernestine Anderson Way honorary designation. Racine Anderson was a legendary American jazz and blues singer from Seattle Center Area and graduate of Garfield High School and Ernestine Anderson Place, a senior affordable housing complex, was constructed in 2012 on South Jackson Street between 20th Avenue South and 20th place south. So this designation will occur adjacent to that housing complex. I did not have an honor to hear Ernestine Anderson perform. She passed away at the age of 87 earlier this year. But her legacy certainly is impressive. One anecdote I read in her obituary talked about how she was born in Houston and moved to Seattle in high school , and her father came to Seattle looking for work, but also because he wanted to be on the West Coast. And Seattle is like a sleepy town where he could get his daughter away from the music scene. Little did he know that Garfield in the Central District at that time was just emerging, and she played a significant role in that. And her overlap with Quincy Jones and Ray Charles and other folks who were in the music scene in Seattle at that time were impressive. This is a great a great chance to honor one of the leaders in our community for so long and look forward to voting yes on this bill.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Rodney, for the comments. Alex, say a few words. No one else would. Casper and Brian, thank you for describing Ms.. Anderson's background. And many people have been around Seattle for decades and many are recent arrivals. And I just think it's critically important when we celebrate this kind of history is, as you described, she recorded over 37 albums in her lifetime and she was really celebrated as a jazz artists throughout the world when she attended Garfield High School. That's where she met Quincy Jones. And you have to talk publicly about Quincy was a classmate of my mother and father's at Garfield. High school. And so I've had the opportunity to sort of over the years, interface with Miss Anderson's family. And her daughter Yvonne was attending school with myself. She's part of some great history in Seattle with groups such as Bumps Blackwell and Buddy Catlett and, of course, Quincy Jones. And those folks, if you go to the Safeway on 23rd and in Madison, you'll see a picture of a group called Bumps Blackwell. That many folks. It was just one of the best jazz groups around. And Quincy Jones is in that picture. And my father is a saxophone player sitting right next to Quincy Jones. So it's quite extraordinary what talent has come out of this city. Quincy Jones described Ernestine his voice as, quote, honey at dusk, and he said that the world got a taste of her honey. And she performed in the Monterey Jazz Festivals at Carnegie Hall in the White House during the first inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower at the Kennedy Center. She toured Europe and had many concerts in London and New York. So again, quite a local treasure. In 1999, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer, Brian Lenker published a book I think many of you have heard of. It's called I Dream a World. And in that book, she he describes 75 women, African-American women who really changed America, Coretta Scott King, Sarah Vaughan, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks and our own Ernestine Anderson is in that book. So, so again, she's quite a legend. And I think as we preserved what's great in this city, I think part of that is actually preserving names like Reverend McKinney and Ernestine Anderson and others.

This is this is an item that came before public safety. And we requested a report actually a very long time ago on our current fire impact fees and how those fees are utilized and how much money is a revenue is collected through those fees. In light of the recommendations or the presentation that was made by the fire department, it became apparent to all of us that we need to reassess our fire impact fees and look at alternative methods of funding fire facilities moving forward. Because we don't have really a long term way of preparing for infrastructure needs and building new facilities within the fire department. And as we start to see more density and growth throughout the city, we should be reevaluating whether our fire impact fees, our development fees that include impacts to city infrastructure are appropriate in light of our need .

Councilwoman Price. Do every fiber come into the center?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, we have the issue. Your time starts now.\nSpeaker 0: Hello again. I'd like to. I'd like you all to strongly consider this item very carefully, very important. There are a lot of funding options from the case study. Clearly, our. Fire and destruction needs to be modernized and updated to reflect the needs of the city. Getting new locations is good. Getting back to planning for how to most effectively meet our needs. The construction and furnishing of new buildings defined by the services. I mean, that's a tremendous opportunity not just to work with storage, but I mean, you know, just a community resource. I mean, there's so many things that can be done when people have to defund the police. I mean, $10 million a week, $10 million for some of these properties. I mean, item to get, you know, the purchase of the property which which is a good thing to land is the most important after the city. But how we optimize and utilize that, how we prepare for emergency services and potentiality, that is very, very important. I very much appreciate the councilwoman for bringing forth. Thank you. Any room comfortable in my purse, would you? Actually.\nSpeaker 1: I guess I'll second this motion. There's not already a second.\nSpeaker 0: And also we only have a second.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I support this item, and I wanted to speak to it just because in the downtown, obviously we've had a lot of development with the downtown plan. There's other strategies that will happen after I leave office around more development throughout the city. And we also have our inclusionary housing policy that we've just adopted, recognizing that whenever we have increased density, which means new development, that we also need to respectfully ensure that we're collecting enough fees to build our infrastructure. And so I fully support this. I don't have the agenda item in front of me right now, but I'd love to see what our impact fees are and what other cities are doing. Thank you for bringing this item. It's been talked about for a while, so appreciate it, Mr. Vice Mayor.

Last year, both the building code and the fire code updates were delayed due to the public health emergency. Just highlighting the major changes in the fire code. There are four sort of categories of major, major changes. One relates to our allowing alternative fuel vehicles on display inside buildings to maintain their battery connection in order to keep their safety systems active. A second change relates to the need for integrated testing systems in high rise buildings to assure fire protection and life safety systems work together in an integrated way as intended and are tested at least every ten years. Third relates to a need for mobile fueling of vehicles to allow allow for mobile fueling of vehicles in designated areas such as parking lots and only those parking lots that meet certain requirements.

She toured Europe and had many concerts in London and New York. So again, quite a local treasure. In 1999, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer, Brian Lenker published a book I think many of you have heard of. It's called I Dream a World. And in that book, she he describes 75 women, African-American women who really changed America, Coretta Scott King, Sarah Vaughan, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks and our own Ernestine Anderson is in that book. So, so again, she's quite a legend. And I think as we preserved what's great in this city, I think part of that is actually preserving names like Reverend McKinney and Ernestine Anderson and others.

Speaker Committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 1: Casper. Mesquita.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I want to say thank you to our friends at the ACLU. The folks at ACLU, specifically Shanker and Orion, has been working to make sure that we put into place advanced meter infrastructure technology that protects the data of all consumers. Councilmember O'Brien has been working on this for a while, and I want to thank the folks at Seattle City Light and the Office of the Attorneys, the city attorneys as well. We have been able to craft legislation that I think accomplishes the following. We want to make sure that an AI led technology is implemented in a way to make sure that we can monitor energy efficiency and improve the collection of actual data so that our bills reflect the actual usage and that we can identify ways to improve energy efficiency over the long haul. What we know is that because of Councilmember Brian and the previous council here, there has been policies put into place in rules that do protect consumer data. What this legislation does is it codifies our commitment to making sure that all data is truly protected, that we as a city and our subcontractors don't share, disclose or make available consumer data in a way that would be inappropriate. We want to make sure that every customer, every resident in Seattle feels comfortable using the AMI technology and for those who don't. This legislation also sets limits on the fees associated with opting out, making it clear that they can be no more than the cost of actually reading the alternative meter. So that I think that we create a little bit more parity here. Again, I think that this is important for us as we get into new areas where we're using technology in different ways, where we're collecting data that we haven't collected in the past. We need to step up and make sure that our contracts and our commitment to protect data reflect each other. So I'm really excited about the type of commitments this will put in place for contracts in the future. We also want to make sure that the customers feel that we have responded to their concerns with urgency, and I think that this legislation does that. So I appreciate the past steps that Seattle City has made, and I really hope that the Council will adopt this resolution or sorry, adopt this ordinance today to codify these rules into statute. Again, I want to thank Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you to your staff, especially Lakeisha Farmer, who's been working with us on this. And I look forward to working with you all to make sure that we implement these councilmember action. Councilmembers have been very helpful as well in our committee as we talked about this issue multiple times over the last few months. So thank you to all of you for your collaboration and for helping us to find the right path forward on AMI protections.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Customers get any comments?\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Yeah. Thank you. I want to go right back at Councilmember Mosquito. I really appreciated the time you've spent on this and bringing Seattle City Light to the table. But also, I think importantly, a number of our I would consider them to be some of the loyal opposition around privacy that they wanted to make sure that we were not going in and getting data from people's homes and businesses that they felt was personal. And the fact that we had ACLU involved in the conversations and that at our last meeting, I asked one of the speakers directly. Are you supporting this legislation as is? And the answer was yes. So thank you so much for the work that you've done in pulling this together. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Q Councilmember O'Brien.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you for your comments, Councilman Muscat. I appreciate the recognition, but I want to say that to get it to this point required a lot of work, and it was just a lot of back and forth on nuances of working with attorneys in the department. And I want to give credit to the city attorney's office and Seattle, see the light for them showing up for those conversations. But I know you and your team put a lot of time into getting it here, and I'm grateful to get the chance to work with you on this. I'm really proud of this legislation and thank you for doing that.\nSpeaker 1: Very good.

My name's Kevin Kennedy. I'm the city treasurer. Madame Mayor. Happy belated birthday. Thank you. City Council. Just to give you a quick update on Wells Fargo, as the report indicates, we did sell the positions that we had in Wells Fargo as of June 30th. So the portfolio does not hold. Any Wells Fargo securities in it, which was the the direction we got from counsel. Last spring.\nSpeaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.\nSpeaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.\nSpeaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited. But taking one issue or out of that mix probably doesn't affect the portfolio in the long run.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any other questions from vice mayor?\nSpeaker 4: It's not really a question. I just wanted to say thank you to both you and Elena for your work on this.

As I discussed in this morning's council briefing is related to the Seattle Parking Enforcement Officers Guild's Collective Bargaining Agreement. This council bill would authorize the execution of a negotiated union contract between the city of Seattle and that bargaining unit. This is a three year contract from January 1st, 2019 through December 31st, 2021, and includes approximately 105 regularly appointed city employees in the Seattle Police Department. The financial terms of this union contract are similar to those of the State Coalition's union contracts and include a retroactive 4% annual wage increase for 2019 and a 3.6% annual wage increase for 2020. The financial and non-financial terms in this collective bargaining agreement were considered and approved by the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee and are within those previously approved parameters.

Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for those remarks. Just really quickly, I want to be just responsive to the extent that I can. We don't need to belabor the point, but this this particular contract, and based on the evaluation given to us by the city Budget Office, does not have dire or detrimental impacts on the projected deficit of the city of Seattle. I think that I and the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee, which include four other Council members and members of the executive team, carefully engaged with the city budget office to make sure that this was not only a high road employer contract, but also a contract that was fiscally responsible and within our existing means as a city and feel comfortable that the contract before us strikes the right balance and that in approving this contract, we will not be subjecting the city budget to to further pressure or crisis as a result of the the the contract. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting approval of this particular contract. Any other questions or comments, colleagues? Because remember Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Madam President. I do just want to signal that I will be voting in favor of ratifying this contract today. I think it's critical that as we go into what is going to be a very difficult a lot of very difficult conversations about the budget over the summer, in this fall, can we not lose sight of the fact that some of the most essential functions of government that we serve as a city are our first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and certainly the employees that are included under this contract that provide an essential law enforcement based mechanism that is really essential to maintaining the social contract that holds the city of Seattle together . This these are some of the services that we need to fight more than ever to make sure that we are maintaining adequately and that these are workers, that we are seeking to have measures in place to retain and encourage them to stay in our workforce. There's never been a more appropriate time, I think, to ratify a contract like this for this group of workers. I hope it sets a precedent that we try to make sure that we set a budget that not only delivers essential services, but really defines our values as a progressive city. And I think it really starts by making sure that we boldly stand by some of the workers doing really essential and critical work out there. That hasn't abated during this crisis. So I will be voting in favor of this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any other comments or questions on the bill? Hearing and seeing none.

I'm just describing the context of the resolution. And then I will ask for comments, either pro or con, but the University of California in 2014 I'm sorry, there are several incidents that have saddened our country that are described in the legislation itself, such as the incident in 2014, the University of California in Santa Barbara here in 2013 and Cafe Racer 2006. Jewish Federation of Seattle, the Seattle shooting. We can list the types of egregious behavior we've seen in this initiative. 1491 is modeled on the successful laws around the country and is based on a well-established Washington state system protection orders to fill the gaps in the system that allow people experiencing crisis or demonstrating violent behavior to possess and purchase firearms. So as described in the resolution, the contents are for the public safety of all people, including those who harm themselves. And at this point, I will move to pass Council Bill three. I will move to adopt Resolution 31701 and then I'll ask for comments after has been moved to adopt as their second. Okay. I'm sorry. 702i move to adopt resolution 31731702. Is there a second? Okay. Now, at this point, are there any comments regarding this resolution? So hearing then from my colleagues again, I'll just say it. Councilman Burgess, did you want to say a few words? Please do.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Council members, before you begin, I just want to make it clear as the rules that aren't known by many that the inclusion of our comments, we will hear comments from members of the public who wish to speak in opposition, and we will allow the same amount of time for those people as well as the rules require. Councilman Burgess.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much. This measure 1491, which we all get to vote on here in a few weeks at the November election, is another common sense measure around gun safety. The vast majority of gun violence incidents in the state of Washington and frankly, across the United States, almost three quarters of those cases involve suicide or unintentional shootings , what some people refer to as accidental shootings. And in many of those cases, members of families or close personal friends are often aware of the looming crisis that is being presented to a family. And so with the passage of this initiative in November, family members will be able to go before a court and petition for a protection order, which may include the seizure of firearms in the possession of someone who is at great risk. And I hope that my colleagues will join in supporting this measure, supporting initiative 1491, and that the people of Washington state will likewise support that initiative.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Burgess.

My wife and I are on a speech pathology clinic up in Bixby because we have one in Garden Grove as well. I own a real estate investment holding company and we just love 100. So we spend all the time, all our money in Long Beach. We're just super grateful to have the opportunity to have this like wonderful places. But since early sixties, you know, just kind of continue. It wasn't the nicest place in the neighborhood for a long time. We busted our butts and got it really cleaned up and made it really nice. We actually went out and got some really nice chefs from Long Beach to kind of come in and do all of our consulting for our menu. And all of the neighbors are thrilled because they wouldn't go in there before it, and now they're in there maybe once or twice a week.

The bill passes the material signage report of the full council. Please read the report.\nSpeaker 1: Because the report, the full council agenda item one, resolution 316 19, providing an honorary designation of South Jackson Street from 27 south to 23rd Avenue South. S Ernestine Anderson Way.\nSpeaker 0: The council member o'brien.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. So this is coming directly to full council. This ordinance would direct to the Seattle Department of Transportation to manufacture, install and maintain honourary signs at the intersections of South Jackson Street and 20th Avenue, South South Jackson Street and 20th Place, south South Jackson Street and 22nd Avenue, South and South Jackson Street and 23rd Avenue South . Each will reflect the Ernestine Anderson Way honorary designation. Racine Anderson was a legendary American jazz and blues singer from Seattle Center Area and graduate of Garfield High School and Ernestine Anderson Place, a senior affordable housing complex, was constructed in 2012 on South Jackson Street between 20th Avenue South and 20th place south. So this designation will occur adjacent to that housing complex. I did not have an honor to hear Ernestine Anderson perform. She passed away at the age of 87 earlier this year. But her legacy certainly is impressive. One anecdote I read in her obituary talked about how she was born in Houston and moved to Seattle in high school , and her father came to Seattle looking for work, but also because he wanted to be on the West Coast. And Seattle is like a sleepy town where he could get his daughter away from the music scene. Little did he know that Garfield in the Central District at that time was just emerging, and she played a significant role in that. And her overlap with Quincy Jones and Ray Charles and other folks who were in the music scene in Seattle at that time were impressive. This is a great a great chance to honor one of the leaders in our community for so long and look forward to voting yes on this bill.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Rodney, for the comments. Alex, say a few words. No one else would. Casper and Brian, thank you for describing Ms.. Anderson's background. And many people have been around Seattle for decades and many are recent arrivals. And I just think it's critically important when we celebrate this kind of history is, as you described, she recorded over 37 albums in her lifetime and she was really celebrated as a jazz artists throughout the world when she attended Garfield High School. That's where she met Quincy Jones. And you have to talk publicly about Quincy was a classmate of my mother and father's at Garfield. High school. And so I've had the opportunity to sort of over the years, interface with Miss Anderson's family. And her daughter Yvonne was attending school with myself. She's part of some great history in Seattle with groups such as Bumps Blackwell and Buddy Catlett and, of course, Quincy Jones. And those folks, if you go to the Safeway on 23rd and in Madison, you'll see a picture of a group called Bumps Blackwell. That many folks. It was just one of the best jazz groups around. And Quincy Jones is in that picture. And my father is a saxophone player sitting right next to Quincy Jones. So it's quite extraordinary what talent has come out of this city. Quincy Jones described Ernestine his voice as, quote, honey at dusk, and he said that the world got a taste of her honey. And she performed in the Monterey Jazz Festivals at Carnegie Hall in the White House during the first inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower at the Kennedy Center. She toured Europe and had many concerts in London and New York. So again, quite a local treasure. In 1999, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer, Brian Lenker published a book I think many of you have heard of. It's called I Dream a World. And in that book, she he describes 75 women, African-American women who really changed America, Coretta Scott King, Sarah Vaughan, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks and our own Ernestine Anderson is in that book. So, so again, she's quite a legend. And I think as we preserved what's great in this city, I think part of that is actually preserving names like Reverend McKinney and Ernestine Anderson and others. So I'm very happy to support this resolution. You know the comments. Okay. So those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i, i, those opposed vote no. The ayes have it.

National Teen Dating, Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month is an effort to raise awareness about abuse in teen relationships and promote programs that prevent it during the month of February. Unfortunately, dating violence among teens is more common than most people know, according to a recent all national recent national survey. One in ten teens reported being hit or physically hurt, hurt by purpose or hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend once in the last 12 months. In addition, one in four teenagers have been in a relationship where a partner is verbally abusive. By supporting the National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, that's that's a mouthful. We as a city can bring awareness to the issue on a local level and demonstrate our commitment to fostering and supporting a healthier community for all. And we're going to hear during public comment from Candi Lewis, executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. Ms.. Lewis will share with us what her organization is doing to help address teen teen dating violence and how we can support their efforts. And with that, I'll move to move the item.\nSpeaker 1: It's a motion in a second, Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. I think it's really important we make sure that we're talking about teen dating violence, both traditional and also via social media and other formats. It's really important. Our teens are certainly the future, and we want to make sure that, you know, that this council is very supportive of of what you're doing. And hopefully, if you are going through anything, you can seek support. But I look forward to hearing from the public and hearing a little bit more about about this issue. But let's stay on this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Any public comment on the item? Seeing nonmembers, please cast your votes. I didn't see over there.\nSpeaker 9: I.\nSpeaker 1: Let's let's let that lady make a few comments.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor Garcia, Councilmember Richardson and the esteemed council members. My name is Candy Lewis, and I am the executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. We are a nonprofit, and our mission is to address teen dating violence and sexual assault in youth and communities of color. Teen dating violence is an epidemic. And the numbers that you've heard are just reported. The reported numbers are dismal, but the actual numbers are even worse right now. 90 every 90 seconds, a girl in the United States is assaulted. But that's only reported. That's a girl this over 12 years old. And so we're not really showing those correct numbers, according to our surveys that we have personally done in the last five years. We've had over 2200 people that we've surveyed. 37% were African-American. 43% were Latino, Latina, 9% white, 5% Asian, 33%. Pacific Islander, two Middle Eastern, 2%. Middle Eastern. 48% of youth and young adults have experienced sexual assault, dating and domestic violence by the sixth grade. 60.3% of youth and young adults report being hit, slapped, grabbed, pinch, spit, act, and over 60% didn't realize that they could be in a dating and domestic violence relationship. Teen dating violence looks like physical assault, verbal abuse, emotional mental, physical stalking and of course, cyber. And we thank you very much for bringing this to your to the city's attention. It is a national resolution. And because of your support, we'll be able to bring local work, a local commitment here into the city of Long Beach. There's a lot of work that's already being done, but it's not nearly enough because all of our children are impacted. Violence and abuse actually starts in the womb, and if we do not address it, we are going to have a worse problem. Right now, the numbers are 36% of every pregnant woman is physically assaulted. 36%. If we were to turn around and look at the audience and ask them, how many of you have experienced teen dating violence , domestic violence or sexual assault? I'm sure almost everyone would be because every one of us is impacted by it. If it's not in our family, it is in our neighbors, it's in our children. And so I thank you very much for bringing this to light. We do have additional information that we will be happy to share with you. I also have something for you all. I brought our brochure that talks about the work that we do. We not only address teen dating violence and sexual assault, but we also address bullying healthy relationships. Because if we do not talk about healthy relationships, we won't be talking about any relationships as well. And our organization has been partner with all state foundation to eliminate teen dating violence and sexual assault. And so I have a little something for everyone.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, ma'am.

Council members. So on.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Britain Brian. This council constable transfers of former substation property in the deluge neighborhood of Seattle from City Light to the Parks Department. Under state law, public utilities are financially distinct from the city, and so the property had to be sold at fair market value. In this case, the property was not part of Park's strategic plan, but the community wanted to maintain it as a greenspace. So the Delbridge Neighborhoods Development Association raised the money by winning grants to pay for it, and that menu is attached to the Council bill. I want to thank Dale Rich Neighborhoods Development Association for their work on behalf of their community and also thanks to City Light staff who as usual, have made sure to give the community the time they need to make the whole thing work. They went through a transparent process. My office also visited the property with the community members back in 2014, which is also a reflection of the careful way that City Light staff approached the disposition of property of this kind. And the committee recommends for council pass the bill.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Council members want any further comments? Councilmember Herbold.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I just want to say a few words. This project is in my district, District one. No, this is a project that our committee members have been working on for quite some time. I actually was on a community tour last week when this was being heard in committee. I want to thank the Parks Department for their funding contribution as well as King County for for theirs as well. The work that community members and our neighborhood district associations specifically I want to call out Willie Brown is fantastic in the vision for this property is really exciting as well. Not only will they be using the space for a natural wetland which will detail storm water runoff, alleviating flooding of neighborhood yards and driveways, but it will also provide a bio filtration of stormwater runoff before it enters Longfellow Creek. And then DDA will partner with Seattle Tilth and Nature Consortium and staff and students from Louisa Boren stem k through eight school to develop and manage the remaining part of the property as a permanent culture food forest. And this is really important for this community because Delbridge is a food desert. The land management system contains aspects of the native habitat with edible forest gardening and a children's garden will link classroom and field experience to educate local youth in environmental science and stewardship and atmosphere. So this is just a fantastic project.

Hopefully, this can be a comparatively brief agenda item. Council Bill 120264 is aptly described by the title of the legislation. We heard a great presentation in committee last week from the Parks Department on the need to have a clearer regime to define what commercial activity might be in a park, and to have some kind of system to regulate the extent to which there can be allowed commercial activity, both in terms of the time and the space that that takes up in a public park going forward. So for the first time, this legislation creates a definition of what is considered commercial activity. To give a couple of examples of the kinds of activity parks has in mind that they would like to be able to facilitate with some level of consideration. And to do only permit would be something like an exercise class or a yoga class or some kind of mild food concession that might be seasonal. So some examples that were given were the food truck pilot for permitting in Westlake Park, which has been a fairly common occurrence over the last couple of years in the downtown core and potentially having services similar to that on a seasonal basis and some other parks around the city. This legislation was passed unanimously out of committee with five councilmembers voting in favor and nine opposed. And I am happy to move the legislation.\nSpeaker 0: Is there a second, second rate?

I'm hoping that going forward as council president, that we instill a safe place, a kind place, so the rest of the city can see that we are a functioning council. They can agree to, agree to disagree and still move forward for this great city. Again, I will use the point of order and I will mute us if indeed this Council President feels that we are not following those basic rules of decency and debate to our colleagues. So with that colleagues, this concludes our items of business today. Our next regularly scheduled city council meeting is on February 15th two, and I hope you all have a great afternoon.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Anderson's legacy and contributions to the music scene in Seattle were honored through the honorary designation of South Jackson Street as Ernestine Anderson Way.", "reference_documents": ["Speaker 0: Thank you. The bill passes the material signage report of the full council. Please read the report.\nSpeaker 1: Because the report, the full council agenda item one, resolution 316 19, providing an honorary designation of South Jackson Street from 27 south to 23rd Avenue South. S Ernestine Anderson Way.\nSpeaker 0: The council member o'brien.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. So this is coming directly to full council. This ordinance would direct to the Seattle Department of Transportation to manufacture, install and maintain honourary signs at the intersections of South Jackson Street and 20th Avenue, South South Jackson Street and 20th Place, south South Jackson Street and 22nd Avenue, South and South Jackson Street and 23rd Avenue South . Each will reflect the Ernestine Anderson Way honorary designation. Racine Anderson was a legendary American jazz and blues singer from Seattle Center Area and graduate of Garfield High School and Ernestine Anderson Place, a senior affordable housing complex, was constructed in 2012 on South Jackson Street between 20th Avenue South and 20th place south. So this designation will occur adjacent to that housing complex. I did not have an honor to hear Ernestine Anderson perform. She passed away at the age of 87 earlier this year. But her legacy certainly is impressive. One anecdote I read in her obituary talked about how she was born in Houston and moved to Seattle in high school , and her father came to Seattle looking for work, but also because he wanted to be on the West Coast. And Seattle is like a sleepy town where he could get his daughter away from the music scene. Little did he know that Garfield in the Central District at that time was just emerging, and she played a significant role in that. And her overlap with Quincy Jones and Ray Charles and other folks who were in the music scene in Seattle at that time were impressive. This is a great a great chance to honor one of the leaders in our community for so long and look forward to voting yes on this bill.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Rodney, for the comments. Alex, say a few words. No one else would. Casper and Brian, thank you for describing Ms.. Anderson's background. And many people have been around Seattle for decades and many are recent arrivals. And I just think it's critically important when we celebrate this kind of history is, as you described, she recorded over 37 albums in her lifetime and she was really celebrated as a jazz artists throughout the world when she attended Garfield High School. That's where she met Quincy Jones. And you have to talk publicly about Quincy was a classmate of my mother and father's at Garfield. High school. And so I've had the opportunity to sort of over the years, interface with Miss Anderson's family. And her daughter Yvonne was attending school with myself. She's part of some great history in Seattle with groups such as Bumps Blackwell and Buddy Catlett and, of course, Quincy Jones. And those folks, if you go to the Safeway on 23rd and in Madison, you'll see a picture of a group called Bumps Blackwell. That many folks. It was just one of the best jazz groups around. And Quincy Jones is in that picture. And my father is a saxophone player sitting right next to Quincy Jones. So it's quite extraordinary what talent has come out of this city. Quincy Jones described Ernestine his voice as, quote, honey at dusk, and he said that the world got a taste of her honey. And she performed in the Monterey Jazz Festivals at Carnegie Hall in the White House during the first inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower at the Kennedy Center. She toured Europe and had many concerts in London and New York. So again, quite a local treasure. In 1999, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer, Brian Lenker published a book I think many of you have heard of. It's called I Dream a World. And in that book, she he describes 75 women, African-American women who really changed America, Coretta Scott King, Sarah Vaughan, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks and our own Ernestine Anderson is in that book. So, so again, she's quite a legend. And I think as we preserved what's great in this city, I think part of that is actually preserving names like Reverend McKinney and Ernestine Anderson and others.

The Seattle building code was passed earlier this month through Councilmember Strauss's leadership and through his committee. We work to pass a fire code in conjunction with the building code to ensure consistency in development standards. The fire code was last updated in 2016 and it's usually updated every three years. Last year, both the building code and the fire code updates were delayed due to the public health emergency. Just highlighting the major changes in the fire code. There are four sort of categories of major, major changes. One relates to our allowing alternative fuel vehicles on display inside buildings to maintain their battery connection in order to keep their safety systems active. A second change relates to the need for integrated testing systems in high rise buildings to assure fire protection and life safety systems work together in an integrated way as intended and are tested at least every ten years. Third relates to a need for mobile fueling of vehicles to allow allow for mobile fueling of vehicles in designated areas such as parking lots and only those parking lots that meet certain requirements.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Council members discussed the feasibility of including Alameda in the Bay Area Bike Share Program, which is operated by MTC and expanded from 700 to 7000 bicycles in Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, Emeryville, and Berkeley.", "reference_documents": ["Speaker 1: Considered directing staff to provide the city council with a report on the feasibility of including Alameda in the service area or the Bay Area Bike Share Program. This referral came from Councilmember Ody and Brody.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you for being at such a late hour. I'll try to be brief so we can get out of here. So just as a little bit of background, MTC, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission recently contracted with a company to operate the bike share program and expanded from 700 bicycles to 7000 bicycles are doing this in Oakland, San Francisco , San Jose, Emeryville and Berkeley. Unfortunately, Alameda is not part of that. I know the MBC was looking to expand it to other cities and I would just like to get the sense of the council to instruct staff that if MTC is still looking to expand this or if they're looking to expand this in the future, you know that Alameda make an effort to participate because I think we really are of all of the cities in the Bay Area the most bikeable and you know bike sharing for those that don't know it like city car share where you can pick up a car, you know, take it somewhere and drop it off. Same thing with bike sharing and get on a bike. I think somebody even mentioned it not at the last meeting, but in the previous meeting. You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later. So I know it's not like the biggest issue facing the council today and this month, but I think it's something that, you know, given our our geography and our topography as being flat and the way all of Alameda loves biking and reducing car emissions, that is something that we consider being a part of in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a big fan of city bike share programs. When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it. I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city. We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders. But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.\nSpeaker 3: So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.\nSpeaker 0: Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.\nSpeaker 3: We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too. So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral. I think that's a great idea.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member de SAC.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, I think we should certainly take a look at this and as part of the review of it, also make sure to involve outfits that at this point in time rent out bikes in Alameda, of which there might be several. Particularly one on an offshore onshore island drive near the McDonald's restaurant. So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.\nSpeaker 5: And Rudy in the staff report. You know, there were a lot of different, you know, issues like, for example, not taking away parking meters, space, things like that. So a lot of this has to be evaluated. But it would be nice if Alameda. Yeah. Could be at least at the table and and be one of the possible future sites for this.\nSpeaker 0: That concludes that item in. Yes. You're good. All right.

My name's Kevin Kennedy. I'm the city treasurer. Madame Mayor. Happy belated birthday. Thank you. City Council. Just to give you a quick update on Wells Fargo, as the report indicates, we did sell the positions that we had in Wells Fargo as of June 30th. So the portfolio does not hold. Any Wells Fargo securities in it, which was the the direction we got from counsel. Last spring.\nSpeaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.\nSpeaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.\nSpeaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited.

I just wanted to say thank you to both you and Elena for your work on this. And, you know, I think that it's tremendous that not only did we say we were going to do something, but we've actually taken action and we did it in a way that was fiscally savvy for our city.

The committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Lewis, it's all you.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you so much, Madam President. Hopefully, this can be a comparatively brief agenda item. Council Bill 120264 is aptly described by the title of the legislation. We heard a great presentation in committee last week from the Parks Department on the need to have a clearer regime to define what commercial activity might be in a park, and to have some kind of system to regulate the extent to which there can be allowed commercial activity, both in terms of the time and the space that that takes up in a public park going forward. So for the first time, this legislation creates a definition of what is considered commercial activity. To give a couple of examples of the kinds of activity parks has in mind that they would like to be able to facilitate with some level of consideration. And to do only permit would be something like an exercise class or a yoga class or some kind of mild food concession that might be seasonal. So some examples that were given were the food truck pilot for permitting in Westlake Park, which has been a fairly common occurrence over the last couple of years in the downtown core and potentially having services similar to that on a seasonal basis and some other parks around the city. This legislation was passed unanimously out of committee with five councilmembers voting in favor and nine opposed. And I am happy to move the legislation.\nSpeaker 0: Is there a second, second rate? Are there any other comments regarding Councilmember Lewis's legislation? Not seeing or hearing none. Will the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill?\nSpeaker 2: Want? Yes. Strauss.

Before we move on to a chairman and other businesses, I have a few comments I want to make that I had been hoping that I would not have to make at this point, but apparently it looks like I. Moving forward as a point of order, this council president will have an exercise and hopefully you will all recognize my quote unquote, my virtual gavel that it will mute us. I am going to rely on our colleagues to abide by all rules, hold us accountable to rules, behavior, and courtesy of decorum, civility and basic kindness. The members are reminded that it is never in order to make personal remarks or attacks. The members are reminded that colleagues will not attack or question the integrity or motives of other colleagues. And the members are reminded that we will not be discourteous to each other or make personal and insulting remarks. I'm hoping that going forward as council president, that we instill a safe place, a kind place, so the rest of the city can see that we are a functioning council. They can agree to, agree to disagree and still move forward for this great city. Again, I will use the point of order and I will mute us if indeed this Council President feels that we are not following those basic rules of decency and debate to our colleagues.

So this resolution supports the initiative. 1491. I'm sorry. Here. I have a lot of paperwork in front of me. And as you well know, 1491 is an initiative to the people of our state relative to, I say, urging voters to vote yes relative to a law that would suspend a person's access to firearms if there's documented evidence that an individual is threatening harm to themselves or others because of dangerous mental illness or a high risk of violent behavior. And if you look at the substance of the resolution itself, and I'm not at this point in the proceeding, I'm just describing the context. This is not my pro or con statement. I'm just describing the context of the resolution. And then I will ask for comments, either pro or con, but the University of California in 2014 I'm sorry, there are several incidents that have saddened our country that are described in the legislation itself, such as the incident in 2014, the University of California in Santa Barbara here in 2013 and Cafe Racer 2006. Jewish Federation of Seattle, the Seattle shooting. We can list the types of egregious behavior we've seen in this initiative. 1491 is modeled on the successful laws around the country and is based on a well-established Washington state system protection orders to fill the gaps in the system that allow people experiencing crisis or demonstrating violent behavior to possess and purchase firearms. So as described in the resolution, the contents are for the public safety of all people, including those who harm themselves. And at this point, I will move to pass Council Bill three. I will move to adopt Resolution 31701 and then I'll ask for comments after has been moved to adopt as their second. Okay. I'm sorry. 702i move to adopt resolution 31731702. Is there a second? Okay. Now, at this point, are there any comments regarding this resolution? So hearing then from my colleagues again, I'll just say it. Councilman Burgess, did you want to say a few words? Please do.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Council members, before you begin, I just want to make it clear as the rules that aren't known by many that the inclusion of our comments, we will hear comments from members of the public who wish to speak in opposition, and we will allow the same amount of time for those people as well as the rules require. Councilman Burgess.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much. This measure 1491, which we all get to vote on here in a few weeks at the November election, is another common sense measure around gun safety. The vast majority of gun violence incidents in the state of Washington and frankly, across the United States, almost three quarters of those cases involve suicide or unintentional shootings , what some people refer to as accidental shootings. And in many of those cases, members of families or close personal friends are often aware of the looming crisis that is being presented to a family. And so with the passage of this initiative in November, family members will be able to go before a court and petition for a protection order, which may include the seizure of firearms in the possession of someone who is at great risk. And I hope that my colleagues will join in supporting this measure, supporting initiative 1491, and that the people of Washington state will likewise support that initiative.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Burgess. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? I do have at least one person who may want to speak in opposition to this particular item. And Mr.. Mr.. Locke, did you wish to speak on this item, sir, at all dealing with the Firearm Initiative Measure 1491. Did you wish to speak to that? You had signed up on several lists? No. Well, let me call for any public comment. Are there any members of the public comment that would like to speak in opposition to this particular resolution or to initiative measure 1491? He? We do. Please come forward, ma'am. And, Amelia, can you make sure this is safe?\nSpeaker 4: I didn't think I was going to be talking on this issue today. But I am Cynthia Lynette, the author, the artist who has produced a body of work called The Gun Show. It will be passed around. I'm very concerned about this resolution that anybody, a family member can take somebody to court. And I don't care about taking away their guns, but then they're going to be required to go through some kind of psychiatric help. And you know what that means?\nSpeaker 5: That means psychotropic drugs. And we do not want them anymore.\nSpeaker 4: So if you could put something in here that says we are not going to give these people psychotropic drugs or require them to take it, then I might consider this. Otherwise, it is not good.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your words. Do any of my colleagues wish to provide any further comments on this resolution? Okay.

Item number four on today's agenda. We talked about quite a bit this morning. This is related to the federal grants that we are accepting. There's a number of important federal grants that are accepted at the end of the year each year. There has been a document that was circulated this weekend by Greg Doss from central staff. And we appreciate all of the work that they did over the weekend to help answer questions that stemmed from the robust discussion in our committee meeting on Wednesday. One of the things that you should also note, in addition to the questions that we have submitted that resulted in 11 page response document, is that Director Noble has sent a letter today to make sure that if there are any additional questions that those get answered before those 2021 allocations are spent. And that's an important commitment from the CBO office, from Director Noble, that he has sent this letter to us, which you all should have received just around 2 p.m. today, to make sure that any additional questions specifically as well related to Homeland Security grants do get answered. As the council member, Strauss discussed this morning. There was a long conversation in Wednesday on Wednesday's meeting, and I do have additional concerns and questions that I will be submitting. Folks are asked by Alex Nucci and Greg Doss that if you do have additional questions that are not yet answered in that 11 page document, please make sure that you send your questions by Wednesday at noon so that central staff can coordinate with the office to answer any additional questions. I want to make sure, though, as Vice-Chair Herbal did during our committee last year, that folks know that there's a number of really important grants that are included in the overall bill as well, and we want to make sure to move this forward to accept those grants. With that, I will be voting yes and the committee voted 5 to 0, recommending passage during full council today. Thank you very much, Madam President.

Councilmember Strauss and then Councilor, you want to go to Councilmember first? Okay. Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Strauss.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I also want to make note of Budget Director Ben Noble's commitment in the Budget Committee meeting to do more work with the Council prior to the the development and submittal of grants that may be of concern to the Council. An example of the work that this Council has done around funding sources that are of concern relates specifically to legislation in 2017 that the Council adopted. You might remember that that year I proposed to create a new section of the municipal code prohibiting Seattle Police Department participation in the U.S. Department of Defense 1033 program that allows cities to transfer excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies at no cost. This was a particular program that we had received concerns about, and in response, we, the chief, had had decided to no longer participate in that program. And then we sort of solidified that policy decision of of of chief best with this with this particular ordinance, I would suggest that our ongoing efforts to take a look at some of these grant sources might result in a request from the council to the department to no longer participate in in some of these grant sources. But I think that is really important work, and I appreciate that that we need to do moving forward. And I appreciate that we have a commitment from the Budget Director that we can take a deeper dove in the future before these grants are sought. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, excellent. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Strauss.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Council President. Thank you, Chairman Skater. And thank you. Also Chair Herbold. Also want to thank Director Noble for your letter. Your letter, as well as the conversation that I had with Greg Doss and Alex Nucci, have resolved the concerns that I have for today. And I will be following up with additional questions as per your letter has requested. I really just want to thank you, Director Noble, for sending that along and working with us in an expedient fashion as well. Again, a thank you to Dr. Fisher and Angela Sochi and Greg, for all of your work answering the 11 pages of questions over the weekend. Thank you, council president. I will be voting yes. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Now way to bury the lead counselor with Strauss. Thank you so much. Colleagues, are there any additional comments on the bill? Right.

Our request today focused on a recent air quality concern with businesses located in City of Paramount, which are both only about a half mile away from District nine Long Beach neighborhoods.

I can talk a little bit about this item.\nSpeaker 3: Vice Mayor, Council and mayor. We are aware that there are concerns that the City of Paramount and accused have around their metal.\nSpeaker 5: Facilities without.\nSpeaker 3: Getting into too much detail on on.\nSpeaker 5: The findings that a Camden Paramount have been.\nSpeaker 3: Discovering. We are willing and interested in working with the Air Quality Management District and our neighbors on figuring out any impacts to Northampton and the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I just have a few questions, Miss Mustang two, and I would hope that the responses could be included in whatever report comes back. I'd like to better understand what hexavalent hexavalent chromium is. I'd like to know the difference between a regular metal shop and the ones that have hexavalent chromium emissions. I know that we have Weber Metals here in Long Beach and Paramount and a number of metal shops that are not necessarily hexavalent chromium emission emitters. And so we want to understand the difference between those two and understand where they where they are that are in Long Beach and close to Long Beach. So we want to understand that and we want to confirm and maybe you can answer this for us now, who is the lead agency that does evaluate potential potential impacts of air quality of businesses that surround Long Beach?\nSpeaker 3: Sure. So the US EPA establishes health based air quality standards that all states must achieve. And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.\nSpeaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.\nSpeaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry. So and it appears that ACME is is the lead on this.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And we have already engaged them, correct?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, that is correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And so when do we anticipate to have some report of the findings of that discussion back to city council?\nSpeaker 3: We think we can have something back to you in about 45 days.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Have we spoken with the City of Paramount as well?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Our office has been in contact with the city manager's office and Paramount.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So and so in 45 days, we'll have a report back. And can that include potential next steps if we do find that there is some impact along beach neighborhoods? Yes, certainly. Well, thank you very much. And so that's my motion to come back in 45 days with a report.\nSpeaker 4: Any other accounts, comments, seen, any public accounts of your anger?\nSpeaker 2: I want to I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward. I know how equality is important to his neighborhoods as it is in mine. So I'm glad that you're bringing this forward and I strongly support it.\nSpeaker 4: Katie, public comment CNN. Okay. We'll go ahead and do the this motion for this for this report. Then with consensus, no objection.

Speaker Committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 1: Casper. Mesquita.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I want to say thank you to our friends at the ACLU. The folks at ACLU, specifically Shanker and Orion, has been working to make sure that we put into place advanced meter infrastructure technology that protects the data of all consumers. Councilmember O'Brien has been working on this for a while, and I want to thank the folks at Seattle City Light and the Office of the Attorneys, the city attorneys as well. We have been able to craft legislation that I think accomplishes the following. We want to make sure that an AI led technology is implemented in a way to make sure that we can monitor energy efficiency and improve the collection of actual data so that our bills reflect the actual usage and that we can identify ways to improve energy efficiency over the long haul. What we know is that because of Councilmember Brian and the previous council here, there has been policies put into place in rules that do protect consumer data. What this legislation does is it codifies our commitment to making sure that all data is truly protected, that we as a city and our subcontractors don't share, disclose or make available consumer data in a way that would be inappropriate. We want to make sure that every customer, every resident in Seattle feels comfortable using the AMI technology and for those who don't. This legislation also sets limits on the fees associated with opting out, making it clear that they can be no more than the cost of actually reading the alternative meter. So that I think that we create a little bit more parity here. Again, I think that this is important for us as we get into new areas where we're using technology in different ways, where we're collecting data that we haven't collected in the past. We need to step up and make sure that our contracts and our commitment to protect data reflect each other. So I'm really excited about the type of commitments this will put in place for contracts in the future. We also want to make sure that the customers feel that we have responded to their concerns with urgency, and I think that this legislation does that. So I appreciate the past steps that Seattle City has made, and I really hope that the Council will adopt this resolution or sorry, adopt this ordinance today to codify these rules into statute. Again, I want to thank Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you to your staff, especially Lakeisha Farmer, who's been working with us on this. And I look forward to working with you all to make sure that we implement these councilmember action. Councilmembers have been very helpful as well in our committee as we talked about this issue multiple times over the last few months. So thank you to all of you for your collaboration and for helping us to find the right path forward on AMI protections.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Customers get any comments?\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Yeah. Thank you. I want to go right back at Councilmember Mosquito. I really appreciated the time you've spent on this and bringing Seattle City Light to the table. But also, I think importantly, a number of our I would consider them to be some of the loyal opposition around privacy that they wanted to make sure that we were not going in and getting data from people's homes and businesses that they felt was personal. And the fact that we had ACLU involved in the conversations and that at our last meeting, I asked one of the speakers directly. Are you supporting this legislation as is? And the answer was yes. So thank you so much for the work that you've done in pulling this together. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Q Councilmember O'Brien.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you for your comments, Councilman Muscat. I appreciate the recognition, but I want to say that to get it to this point required a lot of work, and it was just a lot of back and forth on nuances of working with attorneys in the department. And I want to give credit to the city attorney's office and Seattle, see the light for them showing up for those conversations. But I know you and your team put a lot of time into getting it here, and I'm grateful to get the chance to work with you on this.

It reminds me of what we went through a few years ago when Don I the last Mr. Dean had a property and the city were saying, this is here to auction piece of property that nobody wanted, nobody wanted. And of course, the dean bought it. And within before the ink was dry, before the ink was dry, made $1,000,000 in profit. And if that wasn't bad enough, if that wasn't bad enough, a few weeks later, somebody else said, Oh, that orphaned piece of property has a cousin. And another piece of property that nobody wanted, nobody wanted they sold. And don't quote the exact I think the price was somewhere between 9 to $0.11 an acre. That's almost as bad also as giving away the piece of property which the date is always memorialized in my room around the old hotel on a block from this convention center that nobody wanted and they gave it away for. I think it was a dollar. And that's easy to remember because that was the weekend of when Obama was in Cartagena and even the the ladies down there were holding out for their price. They didn't give up like this city council. One says.\nSpeaker 7: Sir, sir, you cannot sir, you cannot speak out during the council meeting I Well then you have to leave and go outside.

They felt a long basis for police to come so forth. Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: There's a motion in a second, Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, I did want to just take a little the opportunity that I didn't take previously to say when I met with Raintree, I just really was excited about thinking outside of the box and going above and beyond what's required in a project like this. And so looking at the alleyways, talking about doing the mural, the walkability there, connecting the promenade to areas that we typically don't think to connect to, including the arts, and also thinking creatively about our parking challenges that we have.

Item number 13, please.\nSpeaker 1: Communication from City Attorney. Recommendation to adopt resolution expressing its intent to prioritize spending of marijuana business license tax revenue for specific purposes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, I'd like any money that that is generated as a result of the tax to go to the items and areas specified by the city attorney in the resolution with a special focus on public health and safety. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you. And I'll just add my comments here. In August, we submitted this this resolution indicating our intent to use the business license, tax revenue for public safety, public health, homelessness, and general services for regulation and enforcement. And it's great to see that in the final resolution, all of these will be prioritized for spending if this tax passes. So I do want to thank city staff and the City Council for collaboration on this resolution to ensure that the revenue is spent in a way that fully benefits our city and our residents and recovers any costs associated with the regulation of the medical marijuana ordinance should it pass by the voters. So, Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. I also want to thank staff for their report that they did previously and just want to reiterate that do want to see the funds go to cost recovery, prioritize that and then additionally making sure that we are addressing things like first responder times both with our police and our fire, that we are using these dollars to bring back our public safety. And then you know that. When we have that in the general fund, I would definitely support any additional funding after cost recovery and public safety. Again, going to issues of health equity and and areas like that that can be addressed through services. So thank you for your work on this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Andrews.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Vice Mayor. You know, I'd like to thank Mr. Parkins for drafting this resolution. And I would hope that when we talk about public safety, we're not only talking about police and enforcement, but the critical fire service as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item?\nSpeaker 6: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, my Mayor Richardson and honorable city council members. My name is Margaret Dudley and I live in the ninth District. And I would just like to speak on the. The priority for the. The measure a spending funding. I believe you're going to need that for first responders. Police first. Hospitals, mental health care. Also paramedics. You're going to need it also for attorney lawyers because it's going to be a lot of lawsuits. So you need to prioritize that money that you're going to get from Missouri for that. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Margaret. Next.\nSpeaker 7: Night seven works in Soho district is for two resident. Speaking on this agenda item for two different reasons. One, as I stated before, the current tax rates that are being considered under measure M-A are cost prohibitive for a business that is that is currently built for businesses that are going to be taxed under federal schedule to 80 , an effective rate of anywhere between 50 and 80%. So for the purpose of controlling the black market, the best way to meet and to ensure that that will happen is to give support to the businesses that are putting putting themselves in front of the breach and accepting the registration and working within written to the the created regulatory scheme. As such, it would be, you know, even a business like a business tax that anywhere from 8 to 12% is really cost prohibitive for, especially in the retail sector. Secondly, in the interest of protecting measure, it may and the ability in the city's ability to tax at this particular at at these levels, it's I think the city's being too cute by half by engaging in what is by all means a special tax. Any proposition to analysis that goes into the legislative intent of this measure, especially the ones that are being expressed at this turning time, especially for specific allocations towards public towards public safety and cost allocation, as we're talking about, really indicates something that is a special tax and that's fantastic. If the city wants to raise money for first responders, mental health, public health, I'll go along with them. But you also are going to be subject to it to the to it towards passing that particular measure at a two thirds rate, not a 50% plus one. Simple as that. Thank you.

Do you want to explain what we're doing here, please?\nSpeaker 5: Yes, absolutely. So the substitute adds three new sets of language. The first is to add a recital to recognize the council's letter of June 26 and adds it as an attachment. Also, together with that, central staff included recommending a recital that actually refers to the letter. The second set of amendments actually incorporates two edits to memorialize and recognize in two separate places the work that Councilmember Suarez has spearheaded for an independent council consultant for Financial Review. The first edit adds a recital with language from the consultant funding request and the second notes Council's intent to review that council consultant work in Section two . And then the third amended language is to Section one. And it says specifically, in order for the council to potentially carry out review by the end of the year. The intent is to add context to this section regarding what the Council needs in order to have a chance to fulfill the goal of taking final action by the end of the year, as referenced in Section four.\nSpeaker 0: Very good, Councilmember.

So for the hundreds of thousands of viewers at home, I thought it was important that we tell you why. We're sending you a question about the Denver preschool program to the ballot. You may remember that you voted last year to approve the Denver preschool tax for another decade, I believe. But what we do in our elections for sales taxes is we try to predict how much money the city is going to get, both from the tax and overall as a city. So we can tell the voters, according to TABOR. And in this case, we I think I'm looking at David, I think we got it right on the sales tax amount, but we were a little low in what the city would take in overall. And so what that means is we need your permission again, because we told you what we thought we were going to take in. We hope that you will tell us again that we should keep the money that we collected for the preschool and use it to get kids head start in life and get them learning their ABCs and safe and quality child care during their start before school. But this will be a vote tonight in our block vote. It appears to send this to you as voters. And so just wanted to make sure folks knew why.

So this resolution supports the initiative. 1491. I'm sorry. Here. I have a lot of paperwork in front of me. And as you well know, 1491 is an initiative to the people of our state relative to, I say, urging voters to vote yes relative to a law that would suspend a person's access to firearms if there's documented evidence that an individual is threatening harm to themselves or others because of dangerous mental illness or a high risk of violent behavior. And if you look at the substance of the resolution itself, and I'm not at this point in the proceeding, I'm just describing the context. This is not my pro or con statement. I'm just describing the context of the resolution. And then I will ask for comments, either pro or con, but the University of California in 2014 I'm sorry, there are several incidents that have saddened our country that are described in the legislation itself, such as the incident in 2014, the University of California in Santa Barbara here in 2013 and Cafe Racer 2006. Jewish Federation of Seattle, the Seattle shooting. We can list the types of egregious behavior we've seen in this initiative. 1491 is modeled on the successful laws around the country and is based on a well-established Washington state system protection orders to fill the gaps in the system that allow people experiencing crisis or demonstrating violent behavior to possess and purchase firearms. So as described in the resolution, the contents are for the public safety of all people, including those who harm themselves. And at this point, I will move to pass Council Bill three.

Councilman Burgess.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much. This measure 1491, which we all get to vote on here in a few weeks at the November election, is another common sense measure around gun safety. The vast majority of gun violence incidents in the state of Washington and frankly, across the United States, almost three quarters of those cases involve suicide or unintentional shootings , what some people refer to as accidental shootings. And in many of those cases, members of families or close personal friends are often aware of the looming crisis that is being presented to a family. And so with the passage of this initiative in November, family members will be able to go before a court and petition for a protection order, which may include the seizure of firearms in the possession of someone who is at great risk. And I hope that my colleagues will join in supporting this measure, supporting initiative 1491, and that the people of Washington state will likewise support that initiative.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Burgess.

No. Well, let me call for any public comment. Are there any members of the public comment that would like to speak in opposition to this particular resolution or to initiative measure 1491? He? We do. Please come forward, ma'am. And, Amelia, can you make sure this is safe?\nSpeaker 4: I didn't think I was going to be talking on this issue today. But I am Cynthia Lynette, the author, the artist who has produced a body of work called The Gun Show. It will be passed around. I'm very concerned about this resolution that anybody, a family member can take somebody to court. And I don't care about taking away their guns, but then they're going to be required to go through some kind of psychiatric help. And you know what that means?\nSpeaker 5: That means psychotropic drugs. And we do not want them anymore.\nSpeaker 4: So if you could put something in here that says we are not going to give these people psychotropic drugs or require them to take it, then I might consider this.

But appreciate that the council rules were amended in December 2017 so that the assumption would be made that if anybody wanted to use the call in option during any family leave, they had the ability to do so.

My name's Kevin Kennedy. I'm the city treasurer. Madame Mayor. Happy belated birthday. Thank you. City Council. Just to give you a quick update on Wells Fargo, as the report indicates, we did sell the positions that we had in Wells Fargo as of June 30th. So the portfolio does not hold. Any Wells Fargo securities in it, which was the the direction we got from counsel. Last spring.\nSpeaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.\nSpeaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.\nSpeaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited. But taking one issue or out of that mix probably doesn't affect the portfolio in the long run.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any other questions from vice mayor?\nSpeaker 4: It's not really a question. I just wanted to say thank you to both you and Elena for your work on this. And, you know, I think that it's tremendous that not only did we say we were going to do something, but we've actually taken action and we did it in a way that was fiscally savvy for our city. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. And I want to also echo that it was commending our council for moving forward on this item. I think it was important. Yes, I believe it was a referral, yes.

Recommendation to request the City Manager to work with South Coast Air Quality Management District to report on the impacts of the City of Paramount air quality to Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember I'm sorry. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Here in Long Beach, we border a number of cities, and in the ninth district border, the cities of Paramount, Bellflower, Bellflower, Lakewood, Compton, and the community of Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated section of L.A. County. So issues commonly across across commonly cross city boundaries. What's important that we stay up to date on manner matters that can potentially impact our residents? Our request today focused on a recent air quality concern with businesses located in City of Paramount, which are both only about a half mile away from District nine Long Beach neighborhoods. In October 2016, the South Coast Air Quality Management District began investigating two metal processing facilities in the city of Paramount after detecting hexavalent chromium, a potentially cancer causing metal. And in the interests of transparency, we placed this motion on the agenda to request city staff to do our diligence and coordinate with HQ, M.D. and City Paramount to better understand any impacts that this incident has had on our Long Beach residents and their quality of life. So tonight we're beginning that conversation and that discussion and will ask city staff to come back to the City Council with their full findings after engaging HQ, M.D. So we'll start with a brief staff report in a few questions now.\nSpeaker 2: Diana Chang, our manager of Government Affairs. I can talk a little bit about this item.\nSpeaker 3: Vice Mayor, Council and mayor. We are aware that there are concerns that the City of Paramount and accused have around their metal.\nSpeaker 5: Facilities without.\nSpeaker 3: Getting into too much detail on on.\nSpeaker 5: The findings that a Camden Paramount have been.\nSpeaker 3: Discovering. We are willing and interested in working with the Air Quality Management District and our neighbors on figuring out any impacts to Northampton and the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I just have a few questions, Miss Mustang two, and I would hope that the responses could be included in whatever report comes back. I'd like to better understand what hexavalent hexavalent chromium is. I'd like to know the difference between a regular metal shop and the ones that have hexavalent chromium emissions. I know that we have Weber Metals here in Long Beach and Paramount and a number of metal shops that are not necessarily hexavalent chromium emission emitters. And so we want to understand the difference between those two and understand where they where they are that are in Long Beach and close to Long Beach. So we want to understand that and we want to confirm and maybe you can answer this for us now, who is the lead agency that does evaluate potential potential impacts of air quality of businesses that surround Long Beach?\nSpeaker 3: Sure. So the US EPA establishes health based air quality standards that all states must achieve. And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.\nSpeaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.\nSpeaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry. So and it appears that ACME is is the lead on this.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And we have already engaged them, correct?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, that is correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And so when do we anticipate to have some report of the findings of that discussion back to city council?\nSpeaker 3: We think we can have something back to you in about 45 days.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Have we spoken with the City of Paramount as well?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Our office has been in contact with the city manager's office and Paramount.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So and so in 45 days, we'll have a report back. And can that include potential next steps if we do find that there is some impact along beach neighborhoods? Yes, certainly. Well, thank you very much. And so that's my motion to come back in 45 days with a report.\nSpeaker 4: Any other accounts, comments, seen, any public accounts of your anger?\nSpeaker 2: I want to I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward. I know how equality is important to his neighborhoods as it is in mine. So I'm glad that you're bringing this forward and I strongly support it.\nSpeaker 4: Katie, public comment CNN. Okay.

So this resolution supports the initiative. 1491. I'm sorry. Here. I have a lot of paperwork in front of me. And as you well know, 1491 is an initiative to the people of our state relative to, I say, urging voters to vote yes relative to a law that would suspend a person's access to firearms if there's documented evidence that an individual is threatening harm to themselves or others because of dangerous mental illness or a high risk of violent behavior. And if you look at the substance of the resolution itself, and I'm not at this point in the proceeding, I'm just describing the context. This is not my pro or con statement. I'm just describing the context of the resolution. And then I will ask for comments, either pro or con, but the University of California in 2014 I'm sorry, there are several incidents that have saddened our country that are described in the legislation itself, such as the incident in 2014, the University of California in Santa Barbara here in 2013 and Cafe Racer 2006. Jewish Federation of Seattle, the Seattle shooting. We can list the types of egregious behavior we've seen in this initiative. 1491 is modeled on the successful laws around the country and is based on a well-established Washington state system protection orders to fill the gaps in the system that allow people experiencing crisis or demonstrating violent behavior to possess and purchase firearms. So as described in the resolution, the contents are for the public safety of all people, including those who harm themselves. And at this point, I will move to pass Council Bill three. I will move to adopt Resolution 31701 and then I'll ask for comments after has been moved to adopt as their second. Okay. I'm sorry. 702i move to adopt resolution 31731702. Is there a second? Okay. Now, at this point, are there any comments regarding this resolution? So hearing then from my colleagues again, I'll just say it. Councilman Burgess, did you want to say a few words? Please do.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Council members, before you begin, I just want to make it clear as the rules that aren't known by many that the inclusion of our comments, we will hear comments from members of the public who wish to speak in opposition, and we will allow the same amount of time for those people as well as the rules require. Councilman Burgess.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much. This measure 1491, which we all get to vote on here in a few weeks at the November election, is another common sense measure around gun safety. The vast majority of gun violence incidents in the state of Washington and frankly, across the United States, almost three quarters of those cases involve suicide or unintentional shootings , what some people refer to as accidental shootings. And in many of those cases, members of families or close personal friends are often aware of the looming crisis that is being presented to a family. And so with the passage of this initiative in November, family members will be able to go before a court and petition for a protection order, which may include the seizure of firearms in the possession of someone who is at great risk. And I hope that my colleagues will join in supporting this measure, supporting initiative 1491, and that the people of Washington state will likewise support that initiative.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Burgess. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? I do have at least one person who may want to speak in opposition to this particular item. And Mr.. Mr.. Locke, did you wish to speak on this item, sir, at all dealing with the Firearm Initiative Measure 1491. Did you wish to speak to that? You had signed up on several lists? No. Well, let me call for any public comment. Are there any members of the public comment that would like to speak in opposition to this particular resolution or to initiative measure 1491? He? We do. Please come forward, ma'am. And, Amelia, can you make sure this is safe?\nSpeaker 4: I didn't think I was going to be talking on this issue today. But I am Cynthia Lynette, the author, the artist who has produced a body of work called The Gun Show. It will be passed around. I'm very concerned about this resolution that anybody, a family member can take somebody to court. And I don't care about taking away their guns, but then they're going to be required to go through some kind of psychiatric help. And you know what that means?\nSpeaker 5: That means psychotropic drugs. And we do not want them anymore.\nSpeaker 4: So if you could put something in here that says we are not going to give these people psychotropic drugs or require them to take it, then I might consider this. Otherwise, it is not good.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your words. Do any of my colleagues wish to provide any further comments on this resolution? Okay.

As chair of the Energy Committee, this litigation is for the construction of the Denny substation, which is a very large Seattle City Light project in the middle of the Cascade neighborhood, the residential neighborhood and several low income housing buildings are immediately adjacent to the construction site, and substations usually don't go in such dense, densely populated areas. But this one is an exception. I do know that City Light has done a lot of outreach so far to the community and has found ways in which to mitigate the potential impact of the construction of this project on the neighbors. And I support moving forward to the public hearing. Just wanted to highlight the hearing just in case somebody is listening and wants an opportunity to comment. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. So to repeat again, the hearing is July 35, 30 PM at the Bell Town Community Center. Any other questions or comments?

Our request today focused on a recent air quality concern with businesses located in City of Paramount, which are both only about a half mile away from District nine Long Beach neighborhoods. In October 2016, the South Coast Air Quality Management District began investigating two metal processing facilities in the city of Paramount after detecting hexavalent chromium, a potentially cancer causing metal. And in the interests of transparency, we placed this motion on the agenda to request city staff to do our diligence and coordinate with HQ, M.D. and City Paramount to better understand any impacts that this incident has had on our Long Beach residents and their quality of life. So tonight we're beginning that conversation and that discussion and will ask city staff to come back to the City Council with their full findings after engaging HQ, M.D. So we'll start with a brief staff report in a few questions now.\nSpeaker 2: Diana Chang, our manager of Government Affairs. I can talk a little bit about this item.\nSpeaker 3: Vice Mayor, Council and mayor. We are aware that there are concerns that the City of Paramount and accused have around their metal.\nSpeaker 5: Facilities without.\nSpeaker 3: Getting into too much detail on on.\nSpeaker 5: The findings that a Camden Paramount have been.\nSpeaker 3: Discovering. We are willing and interested in working with the Air Quality Management District and our neighbors on figuring out any impacts to Northampton and the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I just have a few questions, Miss Mustang two, and I would hope that the responses could be included in whatever report comes back. I'd like to better understand what hexavalent hexavalent chromium is. I'd like to know the difference between a regular metal shop and the ones that have hexavalent chromium emissions. I know that we have Weber Metals here in Long Beach and Paramount and a number of metal shops that are not necessarily hexavalent chromium emission emitters. And so we want to understand the difference between those two and understand where they where they are that are in Long Beach and close to Long Beach. So we want to understand that and we want to confirm and maybe you can answer this for us now, who is the lead agency that does evaluate potential potential impacts of air quality of businesses that surround Long Beach?\nSpeaker 3: Sure. So the US EPA establishes health based air quality standards that all states must achieve. And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.\nSpeaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.\nSpeaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry. So and it appears that ACME is is the lead on this.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And we have already engaged them, correct?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, that is correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And so when do we anticipate to have some report of the findings of that discussion back to city council?\nSpeaker 3: We think we can have something back to you in about 45 days.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Have we spoken with the City of Paramount as well?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Our office has been in contact with the city manager's office and Paramount.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So and so in 45 days, we'll have a report back. And can that include potential next steps if we do find that there is some impact along beach neighborhoods? Yes, certainly. Well, thank you very much. And so that's my motion to come back in 45 days with a report.\nSpeaker 4: Any other accounts, comments, seen, any public accounts of your anger?\nSpeaker 2: I want to I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward. I know how equality is important to his neighborhoods as it is in mine. So I'm glad that you're bringing this forward and I strongly support it.\nSpeaker 4: Katie, public comment CNN. Okay. We'll go ahead and do the this motion for this for this report. Then with consensus, no objection.

Do you want to explain what we're doing here, please?\nSpeaker 5: Yes, absolutely. So the substitute adds three new sets of language. The first is to add a recital to recognize the council's letter of June 26 and adds it as an attachment. Also, together with that, central staff included recommending a recital that actually refers to the letter. The second set of amendments actually incorporates two edits to memorialize and recognize in two separate places the work that Councilmember Suarez has spearheaded for an independent council consultant for Financial Review. The first edit adds a recital with language from the consultant funding request and the second notes Council's intent to review that council consultant work in Section two . And then the third amended language is to Section one. And it says specifically, in order for the council to potentially carry out review by the end of the year. The intent is to add context to this section regarding what the Council needs in order to have a chance to fulfill the goal of taking final action by the end of the year, as referenced in Section four.\nSpeaker 0: Very good, Councilmember. Whereas we know this is a friendly manner and amendment, I take it.

In regards to resolution 316 for this resolution, as we discussed this morning, is to memorialize the agreements and benchmarks we've already laid out in the last four meetings of this year.

This resolution expresses our commitment to review the MCU that is sent to us in any other documents or legal issues that would be would remain in the purview of the legislative branch. It would maintain authority to prove all subsequent agreements, and we will be ensuring the motion meets our expectations, especially those as laid out in the RFP .

And I also want to thank Councilmember Burgess for his words regarding our duty, our fiduciary duty, and our due diligence in any documents that come from the executive regarding these type of agreements.

And of course, the dean bought it. And within before the ink was dry, before the ink was dry, made $1,000,000 in profit. And if that wasn't bad enough, if that wasn't bad enough, a few weeks later, somebody else said, Oh, that orphaned piece of property has a cousin. And another piece of property that nobody wanted, nobody wanted they sold. And don't quote the exact I think the price was somewhere between 9 to $0.11 an acre. That's almost as bad also as giving away the piece of property which the date is always memorialized in my room around the old hotel on a block from this convention center that nobody wanted and they gave it away for. I think it was a dollar. And that's easy to remember because that was the weekend of when Obama was in Cartagena and even the the ladies down there were holding out for their price.

Second? Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Herbold, you are the prime sponsor of the bill and are recognized in order to address this item. Thank you so much. As discussed earlier this morning in council briefings, this bill relates to both the Civil Service Commission and the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. Both entities have three members, one that's appointed by the mayor, one that's appointed by the council, and one that's elected by the relevant city employees for the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. That is police and fire employees for the Civil Service Commission. It is nonexempt employees who do not work for the mayor or council or civil service commission staff. Both entities are having elections this year and things are slightly delayed.\nSpeaker 2: By.\nSpeaker 0: COVID 19. So this legislation allows the city clerk to hold the elections in December rather than November. It allows for electronic ballots rather than only physical ballots, though the option of paper ballots will still remain, and the schedule changes only for 2020. And these elements are only included in the ordinance, not the Seattle Municipal Code. There are some municipal code changes and that is only related to eliminating out dated language in the municipal code related to the election process. And it allows the city clerk to modernize the election election process by rule in the future.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbals, are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Peterson, please.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, council president and thank you. Councilmember Herbold, a viewing public mind. I know, but during council briefing this morning, we talked a little bit about this particular council bill. And I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for clarifying and just want to point out to the public, the fiscal note does say that this legislation has contingent language to cover that. The Public Safety Civil Service Commission is because of the accountability ordinance from 2017, intended not to have any elected members in the future, so that this leaves open the possibility to implement that provision of the 2017 Accountability Police Accountability Ordinance, which I know several members on this Council were champions of that and authors of that. And so we, by passing this ordinance, are in no way signaling any sort of deviation from our commitment to implement the rest of that accountability ordinance, which which actually excluded employees from this commission. So thank you for clarifying that this morning.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank. Thanks so much, Casimir Peterson. Any other comments on the bill? Okay. Hearing. I appreciate the ongoing conversation here.

As chair of the Energy Committee, this litigation is for the construction of the Denny substation, which is a very large Seattle City Light project in the middle of the Cascade neighborhood, the residential neighborhood and several low income housing buildings are immediately adjacent to the construction site, and substations usually don't go in such dense, densely populated areas. But this one is an exception. I do know that City Light has done a lot of outreach so far to the community and has found ways in which to mitigate the potential impact of the construction of this project on the neighbors.

My name's Kevin Kennedy. I'm the city treasurer. Madame Mayor. Happy belated birthday. Thank you. City Council. Just to give you a quick update on Wells Fargo, as the report indicates, we did sell the positions that we had in Wells Fargo as of June 30th. So the portfolio does not hold. Any Wells Fargo securities in it, which was the the direction we got from counsel. Last spring.\nSpeaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.\nSpeaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.\nSpeaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited. But taking one issue or out of that mix probably doesn't affect the portfolio in the long run.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any other questions from vice mayor?\nSpeaker 4: It's not really a question.

Hopefully, this can be a comparatively brief agenda item. Council Bill 120264 is aptly described by the title of the legislation. We heard a great presentation in committee last week from the Parks Department on the need to have a clearer regime to define what commercial activity might be in a park, and to have some kind of system to regulate the extent to which there can be allowed commercial activity, both in terms of the time and the space that that takes up in a public park going forward. So for the first time, this legislation creates a definition of what is considered commercial activity. To give a couple of examples of the kinds of activity parks has in mind that they would like to be able to facilitate with some level of consideration. And to do only permit would be something like an exercise class or a yoga class or some kind of mild food concession that might be seasonal. So some examples that were given were the food truck pilot for permitting in Westlake Park, which has been a fairly common occurrence over the last couple of years in the downtown core and potentially having services similar to that on a seasonal basis and some other parks around the city.

Moving forward as a point of order, this council president will have an exercise and hopefully you will all recognize my quote unquote, my virtual gavel that it will mute us. I am going to rely on our colleagues to abide by all rules, hold us accountable to rules, behavior, and courtesy of decorum, civility and basic kindness. The members are reminded that it is never in order to make personal remarks or attacks. The members are reminded that colleagues will not attack or question the integrity or motives of other colleagues. And the members are reminded that we will not be discourteous to each other or make personal and insulting remarks. I'm hoping that going forward as council president, that we instill a safe place, a kind place, so the rest of the city can see that we are a functioning council. They can agree to, agree to disagree and still move forward for this great city. Again, I will use the point of order and I will mute us if indeed this Council President feels that we are not following those basic rules of decency and debate to our colleagues.

And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.\nSpeaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.\nSpeaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry. So and it appears that ACME is is the lead on this.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And we have already engaged them, correct?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, that is correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And so when do we anticipate to have some report of the findings of that discussion back to city council?\nSpeaker 3: We think we can have something back to you in about 45 days.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Have we spoken with the City of Paramount as well?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Our office has been in contact with the city manager's office and Paramount.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So and so in 45 days, we'll have a report back. And can that include potential next steps if we do find that there is some impact along beach neighborhoods? Yes, certainly. Well, thank you very much. And so that's my motion to come back in 45 days with a report.\nSpeaker 4: Any other accounts, comments, seen, any public accounts of your anger?\nSpeaker 2: I want to I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward. I know how equality is important to his neighborhoods as it is in mine. So I'm glad that you're bringing this forward and I strongly support it.\nSpeaker 4: Katie, public comment CNN. Okay.

It wasn't the nicest place in the neighborhood for a long time. We busted our butts and got it really cleaned up and made it really nice. We actually went out and got some really nice chefs from Long Beach to kind of come in and do all of our consulting for our menu.

National Teen Dating, Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month is an effort to raise awareness about abuse in teen relationships and promote programs that prevent it during the month of February. Unfortunately, dating violence among teens is more common than most people know, according to a recent all national recent national survey. One in ten teens reported being hit or physically hurt, hurt by purpose or hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend once in the last 12 months. In addition, one in four teenagers have been in a relationship where a partner is verbally abusive. By supporting the National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, that's that's a mouthful. We as a city can bring awareness to the issue on a local level and demonstrate our commitment to fostering and supporting a healthier community for all. And we're going to hear during public comment from Candi Lewis, executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. Ms.. Lewis will share with us what her organization is doing to help address teen teen dating violence and how we can support their efforts. And with that, I'll move to move the item.\nSpeaker 1: It's a motion in a second, Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. I think it's really important we make sure that we're talking about teen dating violence, both traditional and also via social media and other formats. It's really important. Our teens are certainly the future, and we want to make sure that, you know, that this council is very supportive of of what you're doing. And hopefully, if you are going through anything, you can seek support. But I look forward to hearing from the public and hearing a little bit more about about this issue. But let's stay on this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Any public comment on the item? Seeing nonmembers, please cast your votes. I didn't see over there.\nSpeaker 9: I.\nSpeaker 1: Let's let's let that lady make a few comments.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor Garcia, Councilmember Richardson and the esteemed council members. My name is Candy Lewis, and I am the executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. We are a nonprofit, and our mission is to address teen dating violence and sexual assault in youth and communities of color. Teen dating violence is an epidemic. And the numbers that you've heard are just reported. The reported numbers are dismal, but the actual numbers are even worse right now. 90 every 90 seconds, a girl in the United States is assaulted. But that's only reported. That's a girl this over 12 years old. And so we're not really showing those correct numbers, according to our surveys that we have personally done in the last five years. We've had over 2200 people that we've surveyed. 37% were African-American. 43% were Latino, Latina, 9% white, 5% Asian, 33%. Pacific Islander, two Middle Eastern, 2%. Middle Eastern. 48% of youth and young adults have experienced sexual assault, dating and domestic violence by the sixth grade. 60.3% of youth and young adults report being hit, slapped, grabbed, pinch, spit, act, and over 60% didn't realize that they could be in a dating and domestic violence relationship. Teen dating violence looks like physical assault, verbal abuse, emotional mental, physical stalking and of course, cyber. And we thank you very much for bringing this to your to the city's attention. It is a national resolution. And because of your support, we'll be able to bring local work, a local commitment here into the city of Long Beach. There's a lot of work that's already being done, but it's not nearly enough because all of our children are impacted. Violence and abuse actually starts in the womb, and if we do not address it, we are going to have a worse problem. Right now, the numbers are 36% of every pregnant woman is physically assaulted. 36%. If we were to turn around and look at the audience and ask them, how many of you have experienced teen dating violence , domestic violence or sexual assault? I'm sure almost everyone would be because every one of us is impacted by it. If it's not in our family, it is in our neighbors, it's in our children. And so I thank you very much for bringing this to light. We do have additional information that we will be happy to share with you. I also have something for you all. I brought our brochure that talks about the work that we do. We not only address teen dating violence and sexual assault, but we also address bullying healthy relationships. Because if we do not talk about healthy relationships, we won't be talking about any relationships as well. And our organization has been partner with all state foundation to eliminate teen dating violence and sexual assault. And so I have a little something for everyone.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, ma'am.

A comment. I correct myself. No vote, though. No vote. Thank you, Mr. President. So 553 this is actually a measure we are referring to the ballot. So for the hundreds of thousands of viewers at home, I thought it was important that we tell you why. We're sending you a question about the Denver preschool program to the ballot. You may remember that you voted last year to approve the Denver preschool tax for another decade, I believe. But what we do in our elections for sales taxes is we try to predict how much money the city is going to get, both from the tax and overall as a city. So we can tell the voters, according to TABOR. And in this case, we I think I'm looking at David, I think we got it right on the sales tax amount, but we were a little low in what the city would take in overall. And so what that means is we need your permission again, because we told you what we thought we were going to take in. We hope that you will tell us again that we should keep the money that we collected for the preschool and use it to get kids head start in life and get them learning their ABCs and safe and quality child care during their start before school. But this will be a vote tonight in our block vote. It appears to send this to you as voters. And so just wanted to make sure folks knew why.

Recommendation to request the City Manager to work with South Coast Air Quality Management District to report on the impacts of the City of Paramount air quality to Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember I'm sorry. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Here in Long Beach, we border a number of cities, and in the ninth district border, the cities of Paramount, Bellflower, Bellflower, Lakewood, Compton, and the community of Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated section of L.A. County. So issues commonly across across commonly cross city boundaries. What's important that we stay up to date on manner matters that can potentially impact our residents? Our request today focused on a recent air quality concern with businesses located in City of Paramount, which are both only about a half mile away from District nine Long Beach neighborhoods. In October 2016, the South Coast Air Quality Management District began investigating two metal processing facilities in the city of Paramount after detecting hexavalent chromium, a potentially cancer causing metal. And in the interests of transparency, we placed this motion on the agenda to request city staff to do our diligence and coordinate with HQ, M.D. and City Paramount to better understand any impacts that this incident has had on our Long Beach residents and their quality of life. So tonight we're beginning that conversation and that discussion and will ask city staff to come back to the City Council with their full findings after engaging HQ, M.D. So we'll start with a brief staff report in a few questions now.\nSpeaker 2: Diana Chang, our manager of Government Affairs.

We are willing and interested in working with the Air Quality Management District and our neighbors on figuring out any impacts to Northampton and the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I just have a few questions, Miss Mustang two, and I would hope that the responses could be included in whatever report comes back. I'd like to better understand what hexavalent hexavalent chromium is. I'd like to know the difference between a regular metal shop and the ones that have hexavalent chromium emissions. I know that we have Weber Metals here in Long Beach and Paramount and a number of metal shops that are not necessarily hexavalent chromium emission emitters. And so we want to understand the difference between those two and understand where they where they are that are in Long Beach and close to Long Beach. So we want to understand that and we want to confirm and maybe you can answer this for us now, who is the lead agency that does evaluate potential potential impacts of air quality of businesses that surround Long Beach?\nSpeaker 3: Sure. So the US EPA establishes health based air quality standards that all states must achieve. And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.\nSpeaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.\nSpeaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry.

Because I know that this is something that a lot of folks particularly brought in. I know it's an issue that we'll talk about. Continue to talk about. But a lot of the support that the city has received from HUD over the past years have really flatlined, especially in in when we think about inflation. And so there is a potential challenge to the census which undercounted a lot of our populations. And we have but I transient populations are immigrants and that challenge could result in us getting more resources into these HUD block grants that we receive. So just something for the Council to explore because I know that something that others have elevated and that's something I've expressed concern about too, and how it affects how much money, how much we receive in these important block grants that not only help with housing, but also economic development and small business development as well.

As I discussed in this morning's council briefing is related to the Seattle Parking Enforcement Officers Guild's Collective Bargaining Agreement. This council bill would authorize the execution of a negotiated union contract between the city of Seattle and that bargaining unit. This is a three year contract from January 1st, 2019 through December 31st, 2021, and includes approximately 105 regularly appointed city employees in the Seattle Police Department. The financial terms of this union contract are similar to those of the State Coalition's union contracts and include a retroactive 4% annual wage increase for 2019 and a 3.6% annual wage increase for 2020. The financial and non-financial terms in this collective bargaining agreement were considered and approved by the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee and are within those previously approved parameters.

Council President Gonzalez, I appreciate.\nSpeaker 3: The hard work of our Labor Relations Policy Committee and the difficult decisions that you have to make.\nSpeaker 2: I do not serve on that particular committee of legislative and executive leaders who represent management and who negotiate the multitude of employment contracts.\nSpeaker 3: Impacting 12,000 city government workers.\nSpeaker 2: I carefully consider each contract on its own terms, and.\nSpeaker 3: At this moment in time, with the grim.\nSpeaker 2: Fiscal challenges our city.\nSpeaker 3: Government faces today, I'll be voting no on this particular contract for parking enforcement officers. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for those remarks. Just really quickly, I want to be just responsive to the extent that I can. We don't need to belabor the point, but this this particular contract, and based on the evaluation given to us by the city Budget Office, does not have dire or detrimental impacts on the projected deficit of the city of Seattle. I think that I and the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee, which include four other Council members and members of the executive team, carefully engaged with the city budget office to make sure that this was not only a high road employer contract, but also a contract that was fiscally responsible and within our existing means as a city and feel comfortable that the contract before us strikes the right balance and that in approving this contract, we will not be subjecting the city budget to to further pressure or crisis as a result of the the the contract. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting approval of this particular contract. Any other questions or comments, colleagues? Because remember Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Madam President. I do just want to signal that I will be voting in favor of ratifying this contract today. I think it's critical that as we go into what is going to be a very difficult a lot of very difficult conversations about the budget over the summer, in this fall, can we not lose sight of the fact that some of the most essential functions of government that we serve as a city are our first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and certainly the employees that are included under this contract that provide an essential law enforcement based mechanism that is really essential to maintaining the social contract that holds the city of Seattle together . This these are some of the services that we need to fight more than ever to make sure that we are maintaining adequately and that these are workers, that we are seeking to have measures in place to retain and encourage them to stay in our workforce. There's never been a more appropriate time, I think, to ratify a contract like this for this group of workers. I hope it sets a precedent that we try to make sure that we set a budget that not only delivers essential services, but really defines our values as a progressive city. And I think it really starts by making sure that we boldly stand by some of the workers doing really essential and critical work out there. That hasn't abated during this crisis. So I will be voting in favor of this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any other comments or questions on the bill? Hearing and seeing none.

Second? Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Herbold, you are the prime sponsor of the bill and are recognized in order to address this item. Thank you so much. As discussed earlier this morning in council briefings, this bill relates to both the Civil Service Commission and the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. Both entities have three members, one that's appointed by the mayor, one that's appointed by the council, and one that's elected by the relevant city employees for the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. That is police and fire employees for the Civil Service Commission. It is nonexempt employees who do not work for the mayor or council or civil service commission staff. Both entities are having elections this year and things are slightly delayed.\nSpeaker 2: By.\nSpeaker 0: COVID 19. So this legislation allows the city clerk to hold the elections in December rather than November. It allows for electronic ballots rather than only physical ballots, though the option of paper ballots will still remain, and the schedule changes only for 2020. And these elements are only included in the ordinance, not the Seattle Municipal Code. There are some municipal code changes and that is only related to eliminating out dated language in the municipal code related to the election process. And it allows the city clerk to modernize the election election process by rule in the future.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbals, are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Peterson, please.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, council president and thank you. Councilmember Herbold, a viewing public mind. I know, but during council briefing this morning, we talked a little bit about this particular council bill. And I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for clarifying and just want to point out to the public, the fiscal note does say that this legislation has contingent language to cover that. The Public Safety Civil Service Commission is because of the accountability ordinance from 2017, intended not to have any elected members in the future, so that this leaves open the possibility to implement that provision of the 2017 Accountability Police Accountability Ordinance, which I know several members on this Council were champions of that and authors of that. And so we, by passing this ordinance, are in no way signaling any sort of deviation from our commitment to implement the rest of that accountability ordinance, which which actually excluded employees from this commission. So thank you for clarifying that this morning.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank. Thanks so much, Casimir Peterson. Any other comments on the bill? Okay. Hearing. I appreciate the ongoing conversation here. I'm going to go ahead and ask the clerk to call the roll on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 2: Suarez i.\nSpeaker 0: Lewis.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 2: Morales I.\nSpeaker 0: Mosquera.

This is this is an item that came before public safety. And we requested a report actually a very long time ago on our current fire impact fees and how those fees are utilized and how much money is a revenue is collected through those fees. In light of the recommendations or the presentation that was made by the fire department, it became apparent to all of us that we need to reassess our fire impact fees and look at alternative methods of funding fire facilities moving forward. Because we don't have really a long term way of preparing for infrastructure needs and building new facilities within the fire department. And as we start to see more density and growth throughout the city, we should be reevaluating whether our fire impact fees, our development fees that include impacts to city infrastructure are appropriate in light of our need .

I mean, there's so many things that can be done when people have to defund the police. I mean, $10 million a week, $10 million for some of these properties. I mean, item to get, you know, the purchase of the property which which is a good thing to land is the most important after the city. But how we optimize and utilize that, how we prepare for emergency services and potentiality, that is very, very important. I very much appreciate the councilwoman for bringing forth. Thank you.

I support this item, and I wanted to speak to it just because in the downtown, obviously we've had a lot of development with the downtown plan. There's other strategies that will happen after I leave office around more development throughout the city. And we also have our inclusionary housing policy that we've just adopted, recognizing that whenever we have increased density, which means new development, that we also need to respectfully ensure that we're collecting enough fees to build our infrastructure. And so I fully support this. I don't have the agenda item in front of me right now, but I'd love to see what our impact fees are and what other cities are doing. Thank you for bringing this item. It's been talked about for a while, so appreciate it, Mr. Vice Mayor.

Is there a second?\nSpeaker 1: Second.\nSpeaker 0: It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill as sponsor of the bill. I will address that first and then see if any of you colleagues have comments to add. Council Bill 119794. As I discussed in this morning's council briefing is related to the Seattle Parking Enforcement Officers Guild's Collective Bargaining Agreement. This council bill would authorize the execution of a negotiated union contract between the city of Seattle and that bargaining unit. This is a three year contract from January 1st, 2019 through December 31st, 2021, and includes approximately 105 regularly appointed city employees in the Seattle Police Department. The financial terms of this union contract are similar to those of the State Coalition's union contracts and include a retroactive 4% annual wage increase for 2019 and a 3.6% annual wage increase for 2020. The financial and non-financial terms in this collective bargaining agreement were considered and approved by the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee and are within those previously approved parameters. I'm happy to entertain any questions or hear any comments from any of my colleagues. Councilmember Peterson.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President Gonzalez, I appreciate.\nSpeaker 3: The hard work of our Labor Relations Policy Committee and the difficult decisions that you have to make.\nSpeaker 2: I do not serve on that particular committee of legislative and executive leaders who represent management and who negotiate the multitude of employment contracts.\nSpeaker 3: Impacting 12,000 city government workers.\nSpeaker 2: I carefully consider each contract on its own terms, and.\nSpeaker 3: At this moment in time, with the grim.\nSpeaker 2: Fiscal challenges our city.\nSpeaker 3: Government faces today, I'll be voting no on this particular contract for parking enforcement officers. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for those remarks. Just really quickly, I want to be just responsive to the extent that I can. We don't need to belabor the point, but this this particular contract, and based on the evaluation given to us by the city Budget Office, does not have dire or detrimental impacts on the projected deficit of the city of Seattle. I think that I and the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee, which include four other Council members and members of the executive team, carefully engaged with the city budget office to make sure that this was not only a high road employer contract, but also a contract that was fiscally responsible and within our existing means as a city and feel comfortable that the contract before us strikes the right balance and that in approving this contract, we will not be subjecting the city budget to to further pressure or crisis as a result of the the the contract. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting approval of this particular contract. Any other questions or comments, colleagues? Because remember Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Madam President. I do just want to signal that I will be voting in favor of ratifying this contract today. I think it's critical that as we go into what is going to be a very difficult a lot of very difficult conversations about the budget over the summer, in this fall, can we not lose sight of the fact that some of the most essential functions of government that we serve as a city are our first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and certainly the employees that are included under this contract that provide an essential law enforcement based mechanism that is really essential to maintaining the social contract that holds the city of Seattle together . This these are some of the services that we need to fight more than ever to make sure that we are maintaining adequately and that these are workers, that we are seeking to have measures in place to retain and encourage them to stay in our workforce. There's never been a more appropriate time, I think, to ratify a contract like this for this group of workers. I hope it sets a precedent that we try to make sure that we set a budget that not only delivers essential services, but really defines our values as a progressive city. And I think it really starts by making sure that we boldly stand by some of the workers doing really essential and critical work out there. That hasn't abated during this crisis. So I will be voting in favor of this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any other comments or questions on the bill? Hearing and seeing none. I would ask that the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 1: Lewis, I. Morales, I.

Clive's grandfather was Wentworth D'Arcy Uhr. He was educated at Gatton State High School and St John's College, University of Sydney (M.B., Ch.M., 1926). Tall, rangy and active, he represented his college at cricket, shooting and tennis. Back in Queensland, Uhr was appointed resident medical officer (1927), surgical registrar (1928) and radium registrar (1929) at (Royal) Brisbane Hospital. Entering private practice in 1932 as a diagnostic radiologist, he continued at the hospital as assistant-radiologist (1932), assistant radium therapist (1933), and senior radiologist (1938). On 24 August 1933 at St Stephen's Cathedral, Brisbane, he had married with Catholic rites Marie Josephine Barry. On 31 December 1940 Uhr was appointed captain, Australian Army Medical Corps, Australian Imperial Force. Next day he was promoted major and posted as radiologist to the 2nd/10th Australian General Hospital. The unit was sent to Singapore in February and stationed at Malacca, Malaya, in support of the 22nd Brigade. Following the Japanese invasion, the 2nd/10th withdrew to Singapore in mid-January 1942. Uhr worked as anaesthetist as well as radiologist during the campaign. Taken prisoner in February, he was in charge of all X-ray work for the A.I.F. at Changi from August, relying on fluoroscopy when supplies of film ran out. He conducted a survey of men, including survivors from 'F' Force, diagnosed with cardiac beriberi, and established that most had no radiological evidence of damage to the heart. In addition, he was given clinical duties. Private Douglas McLaggan saw him as a good medical officer and 'a man you could talk to'. He returned to Brisbane in September 1945 and transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 6 November. After the war Uhr was always available to the men with whom he had served in Malaya. Admiring their stubborn courage, he often used the phrase 'as hard to shift as the 22nd Brigade'. Every Anzac Day he marched at the head of the Catholic War Veterans' Association, bringing together his passions for the 8th Division and the Catholic Church. He was a member of the Medical Board of Queensland (1955-74) and the council of the Queensland Radium Institute (1955-74), and had been a founder (1939) of the local branch of the Australian and New Zealand Association of Radiology (Royal Australasian College of Radiologists). Uhr was visiting radiologist at the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, and honorary radiologist at Mt Olivet Hospital for the Incurably Sick and Dying, Kangaroo Point. After he retired from his medical practice in 1963, he was on the relieving list of Chermside and Redcliffe hospitals. Elected to the committee of the Brisbane Amateur Turf Club in 1947, Uhr helped to persuade John Wren to sell Doomben racecourse to the B.A.T.C. in 1953. As chairman (1954-74) he built up the Queensland winter racing carnival, particularly the Doomben Ten Thousand and the Doomben Cup. He believed that the ordinary race-goer deserved the best: each race day 'the Doc' would walk from the Flat through the St Leger enclosure to the Paddock, open always to comments and suggestions from punters. Although he preferred flat racing, he was the driving force behind the launch of the Albion Park Trotting Club which staged its first meeting in September 1968. He was chairman of the club in 1968-74. Uhr had a wide range of community interests. President of Past Brothers Leagues Club and the Brisbane Rugby League, he was a member of the Rothmans National Sports Foundation. He was president (1953-74) of the Xavier Society, a group of Catholic laymen who raised funds for Mt Olivet hospital and the Xavier Home for Crippled Children, and was involved with Duchesne and St Leo's colleges, University of Queensland. He was concerned about justice and good government and was in great demand as a public speaker. Interested in the work of B. A. Santamaria, in 1957 he unsuccessfully stood for the Legislative Assembly seat of Kedron, representing the newly formed Queensland Labor Party. In 1960 Uhr helped to set up the Boys Town foundation which raised funds for a home at Beaudesert. That year he was named Queensland's 'Father of the Year'. He was appointed C.B.E. in 1961 and knighted in 1972. Sir Clive was an intensely private man, passionately Australian, a steadfast friend and a devoted husband. He died on 19 September 1974 at his Ascot home and was buried in Nudgee cemetery. His wife, their four sons and two of their three daughters survived him. ### Select Bibliography A. S.

In England, 9 per cent of 16-24 year old women are affected by illiteracy, with 1 in 7 lacking basic skills, which is closely linked with low pay and risk of unemployment. The problem starts at a younger age; 1 in 8 children don't even own a book. While many might argue that the internet has opened more windows of opportunity, the digital age has actually increased the inequality of education around the world; those without it are even more isolated than before. Despite economical, technological and social growth, illiteracy rates have stayed the same. Related Story Literary experts offer advice on how to stand out The Words for Work: Women in Leadership partnership hopes to change this by helping young women from disadvantaged communities with their literacy and communication skills, building their confidence, and helping them to employment. The National Literacy Trust will work with the teachers to select 25 young women aged 16-20, who they think will really benefit from the programme. They will then take part in activities like business days at Lancôme's offices, workshops on formal writing and presentation skills, and talks from inspiring women. Kate Winslet, Lancôme Ambassadress, said: \"It has played a huge role in my life, as an actress in my job and a mother, educating and raising my own children.\" \"But more importantly - and now more than ever - I am so profoundly grateful to be able to use words, to have a voice and to be able to share, listen, respond and feel heard.\" Related Story 10 best books to buy as Christmas gifts Winslet played an illiterate woman, Hanna Schmitz, in The Reader, and when she was researching for the role, she interviewed and spent time with illiterate women - so the scheme highlights a cause close to her heart. This project is part of Lancôme's global campaign Write Her Future, which hopes to tackle the literacy crisis that affects 76 million young women around the world. \"Lancôme's mission has always been to help women find self-confidence and develop assertiveness,\" said a company spokesperson. \"So fighting against illiteracy is very important for them [and us].\" The programme will launch in three schools in London, Manchester and Nottingham in its first year, and will run over the course of a full school term for a minimum of three years.

The fast and furious traveling festival that was hailed last year by Revolver magazine as \"the mother of all shred fests\" will kick off its second year in early September. Look for the tour — the brainchild of MEGADETH frontman Dave Mustaine — to launch in the Northeast and to work its way through 25 major markets before wrapping in mid-October, with Xbox's \"Gears of War\" sponsoring the trek. MEGADETH will return as the festival headliner on a bill that includes fellow heavy-hitters LAMB OF GOD, plus OPETH, ARCH ENEMY, OVERKILL, INTO ETERNITY, SANCTITY and THE SMASHUP all confirmed for these mostly outdoor shows. Other second stage artists will be announced soon. Mustaine personally hand-picks all the Gigantour bands, with a sharp eye on true musicianship. He says Gigantour is a great place for like-minded music fans to see a full day of music on two stages without breaking the bank, and he's glad the tour is back in '06. \"This is the concert that I, as a heavy metal music fan, would want to see,\" says Mustaine. \"It is going to be something to look forward to each year, to see what kind of tremendous talent we can assemble, for Gigantour festivals in the years to come.\" LAMB OF GOD's Mark Morton says, \"MEGADETH is one of the main reasons I started playing metal guitar in the first place. To finally tour with them is really exciting and it's a great way to start off our world tour supporting 'Sacrament'. We've been dying to get the new material up and running on the live stage. We've worked so hard on the new record — it's really a great sense of accomplishment to see the new tunes come to life in a live setting. We're really looking forward to this one.\" The group's Chris Adler says, \"Teaming up with MEGADETH on Gigantour is a metal dream come true. The lineup represents some of the most proficient metal bands and players from across the world and we are looking forward to joining forces and kicking ass. We're planning on a nice long set, introducing a lot of new and very heavy material from 'Sacrament' as well as keeping the brutal live tracks from our previous albums. We can't wait to take the stage and destroy it.\" Last year's inaugural Gigantour was a six-week trek that was hailed by the Miami Herald for featuring \"only bands whose musicianship matches their ability to melt faces with sheer volume and power.\" The Orange County Register agreed, saying, \"...it does a heart good to see Mustaine able to buck the chameleon trend of rock and stay firm to his ideals, keeping the music the priority and not the image.\" As for joining forces with Gigantour, Craig Davison, Director of Global Games Marketing for Xbox, says, \"We're totally jazzed about the partnership between Gigantour 2006 and our forthcoming Xbox 360 blockbuster, Gears of War! Partnering a music extravaganza like Gigantour with the launch of a mega-hit game like Gears of War captures the excitement around two awesome happenings for fans of music and video games!\" Gears of War is a blockbuster video game exclusively for the Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system that blends tactical action with survival horror.

I'm gonna speak!\" insists drummer Luke, bruised following a bitter row during rehearsals for their sell-out comeback show at the O2 Arena. ## Raw footage \"You're gonna speak are you?\" mocks Matt. His twin leaps out of his seat, lunges at his brother aggressively, then storms out. \"Go f*** yourself,\" adds Matt as a parting shot. You don't have to like Bros much to consider After the Screaming Stops, an unflinching document of the duo's attempt to rebuild a relationship fractured after 30 years, one of greatest music films of all time. Are you guys ready to do this again? We are! https://t.co/crnp8k9YUz — Matt Goss (@mattgoss) October 5, 2018 In fact, it's soon clear that Bros don't even like Bros very much. Liam and Noel Gallagher have nothing on these two. ## Insecurities on display For 90 minutes, the 50 year-olds, whose signature hit asked When Will I Be Famous?, scratch away at each other's fragile egos and insecurities, apparently oblivious to the camera crew documenting each perceived slight and hissy fit. After the Screaming Stops, produced by James Corden's Fulwell 73 company, plays as a cross between This Is Spinal Tap and Some Kind of Monster, the similarly raw Metallica documentary which exposed tensions between the metal band's members, eventually resolved by taking a therapist on tour. ## Jealousies Bros's issues go deep. \"He was perceived as the gifted one, the favourite,\" says Luke of the glory years, when Bros sold 10m records and became the youngest band to sell-out Wembley Stadium. Having barely picked up a drum-stick for 25 years after breaking into acting, Luke gets the hump when Matt, who reinvented himself as a highly-successful Las Vegas lounge singer, imposes his musical will at rehearsals. Bros reunite at the O2 Arena in 2017 after a bitter split (BFI) \"You come in and tell me what to do all the time,\" he complains. \"I want to speak occasionally. You're humiliating me but you have the luxury of walking back (to Vegas).\" \"He's angry and hurting people,\" observes Matt. \"It's not a good look for my brother.\" ## Family ties As the clock ticks ominously towards that O2 show, the brothers find common ground when they return to their childhood home and reflect on the perils of fame – they were required to perform on BBC1's Terry Wogan show the day after learning that their sister Carolyn had been killed in a car crash. When the screaming stopped in the early 90s, both were left financially ruined. In an era of pop stars controlled by image managers, the Goss bros should be commended for allowing the world to see them at their most vulnerable. Ultimately, the O2 show is a triumph. Then the rest of the reunion tour is axed.

More than 63,000 fans packed into Arsenal's ground for the visit of Manchester United on Saturday, February 1, 1958. Matt Busby's 'Babes' were the biggest draw in British football at the time thanks to two successive titles and a reputation for exciting, attacking play. \"Within five days of United's win at Highbury, five of their starting line-up perished as a result of the Munich air crash.\" United's famous faces did not disappoint. Duncan Edwards opened the scoring with a fierce shot from the edge of the area, Bobby Charlton beat Jack Kelsey on the half-hour and Tommy Taylor gave United a seemingly unassailable three-goal lead at half time. Arsenal, inspired by the quality of their opponents, raised their game. Incredibly, they drew level with three goals in just three minutes. David Herd, who would go on to play for United, scored Arsenal's first. Jimmy Bloomfield slotted past Harry Gregg to make it 3-2 and, to the delight and disbelief of the home fans, the same player converted a diving header to restore parity. But United were not champions for nothing. They regrouped and regained control, Dennis Viollet firing the visitors back in front before Taylor grabbed his second and United's fifth. Arsenal weren't finished and Welsh international Derek Tapscott set up a grandstand finish by pulling a goal back. Vic Groves went close to an equaliser but the 'Busby Babes' held out for a famous 5-4 victory. Sadly, it was to be their last game on British soil. Within five days of United's win at Highbury, five of their starting line-up perished as a result of the Munich air crash. Left-back and captain Roger Byrne, the entire half-back line of Eddie Colman, Mark Jones and Edwards, plus centre forward Taylor were all killed. The 'Busby Babes' left all who had seen them with fond memories of one of the finest sides to grace the English game. 1 of 8 2 of 8 3 of 8 4 of 8 5 of 8 6 of 8 7 of 8 8 of 8 Bertie Mee is appointed as manager Copyright 2019 The Arsenal Football Club plc.

A representative for Winslet said the private ceremony, held earlier this month, was attended by her two children and \"a very few friends and family\". The Oscar-winner has been engaged to Ned Rocknroll, the nephew of Sir Richard Branson, since the summer. Winslet has previously been married to Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes. She has a daughter, Mia, with Threapleton, to whom she was married to for three years until 2001, and a son, Joe, with director Mendes, from whom she split in 2010. Details of the New York wedding have been kept private, but People magazine reported actor Leonardo DiCaprio attended. DiCaprio and Winslet starred together in the hugely successful Titanic movie, and teamed up again for Revolutionary Road, a grim inspection of married life in suburbia, which was directed by Mendes. Winslet and RocknRoll were at Sir Richard's Caribbean retreat Necker Island in 2011 when a fire devastated the Virgin boss's luxury home. Sir Richard praised Winslet for helping his elderly mother to safety. Rocknroll, who changed his name from Abel Smith, works for his uncle's space flight company, Virgin Galactic. ## More on This Story ### Related Stories Profile: Kate Winslet 15 JUNE 2012, ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS Winslet and Barlow accept honours 21 NOVEMBER 2012, ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS ### From other news sites #### Canberra Times Third time lucky for Rock'nroll Winslet 2 hrs ago #### Yahoo!

The \"Divergent\" star was appearing on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" to plug the film when the host brought up her 14-week-old's unusual moniker. It turns out the name was selected by Winslet's other children, Mia, 13, and Joe, 10, whom she had from her previous marriages to director Sam Mendes and Jim Threapleton. \"We were thinking about names during the pregnancy and actually I had never -- when I was pregnant with Mia, when I was pregnant with Joe -- I didn't name them before they came out because I always felt like I had to see them and see who they're going to be,\" the Oscar-winning actress told DeGeneres in an interview airing Tuesday. \"Of course this time around, there's Mia and Joe and the whole pregnancy is about what are we going to call the baby.\" PHOTOS: Oddly fantastic celebrity baby names The 38-year-old said it was lovely to include her older children in the naming process. \"We settled on Bear quite early on,\" Winslet said. \"A friend of mine when I was younger was nicknamed Bear, and I just had always really loved it and he was very much a bear -- he was everyone's shoulder to cry on, he was a big bear hug, he was just this great figure in my life -- and I just always remembered him and that's where it came from.\" As for Bear's middle name, Blaze, that comes from the fact that Winslet met her third husband and Bear's dad, Ned Rocknroll, after a fire. INTERACTIVE: See Kate Winslet's Hollywood star \"And then Bear's second name is Blaze because my husband and I met in a house fire basically ... and the house burned down and we survived. But we wanted something of the fire,\" she said. Winslet wed Rocknroll, the nephew of Virgin honcho Richard Branson, in December 2012. Rocknroll, who legally changed his name from Abel Smith in 2008 prior to meeting Winslet, reportedly met her in 2011 when the actress was vacationing on Branson's Necker Island (a private paradise in the British Virgin Islands). As the story goes, lightning set the island's main house ablaze, making a hero of the English actress for evacuating Branson's 90-year-old mother, Eve. PHOTOS: Funny women and why we love 'em Controversially, Winslet, who's been married twice before, decided to give her son her own last name rather than Rocknroll. When Degeneres asked why, Winslet replied: \"Why do you think, Ellen?\" \"So you wouldn't have encouraged [Ned] to change it to Rocknroll is what you're saying.\" In other Winslet news, the \"Titanic\" actress was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Monday. \"I am completely overwhelmed by the number of people that there are here today,\" she said (via CBS News). I honestly had no idea that this was going to be quite such a well-attended event, especially after the earthquake this morning -- which frightened me quite a lot actually, I made for a door frame with my breast pump in my hand. \"I feel very honored, 20 years into my own career, to be standing in such a poignant place, and being celebrated in such a spectacular fashion. Thank you very much for my star, and thank you very much for having me,\" Winslet added. ALSO: Miley Cyrus' tour bus catches fire en route to New Orleans Behold the new Angus T.

The collection contains more than ten thousand objects dating from Neolithic times to the present, covering nearly every medium and category of Chinese art.

In her previous tenure as curator of Chinese art at the Freer and Sackler galleries from 1988 to 2006, Stuart was instrumental in bringing greater attention to the fields of Buddhist sculpture, Chinese portraits and court paintings, and the later decorative arts of China through her research, original publications, and thought-provoking exhibitions and catalogues. Stuart has advanced degrees in Chinese art and archaeology and East Asian studies from Princeton and Yale, and is fluent in Mandarin.

It would prove to be a tough season, as the Crusaders finished 10-17 overall and 7-10 in the ultra-competitive Bronx/Westchester division. Although the Crusaders had a rough season, they still remained competitive and had plenty of close losses. But one of their bright spots was a guard with great leaping ability by the name of Jalen Lecque. The 6-foot-4 guard was a very integral part of the Crusaders' offense, as he averaged 11 points a game this season. When he is on the court, Lecque is known for his athleticism, but can also score in bunches. What motivates him to be successful in basketball is, \"To try to be the best in the country, not trying to shortchange myself. I want to show everybody that I can compete with the best in the world.\" Lecque plans to make a move against Team Takeover. (Photo courtesy of J. Sneed Photos) Lecque hails from Teaneck, New Jersey, which is right across the George Washington Bridge from the Bronx. When asked about being from there, he said, \"Being from Teaneck, New Jersey, it's a small town. Eveybody knows me, everybody loves me over there now. I just have to put on for my town.\" Teaneck High School, the local public school is the two-time defending state champions in basketball and one of the best programs in North Jersey. Although Lecque could have chosen to attend there, he decided to make the commute to Scanlan every day, which is on the Hutchinson River Parkway. When asked what made him go to Scanlan, Lecque says, \"You know Scanlan was a good school. We moved up from \"AA\" to \"A\". They have a great coach, good players, it was such a good time.\" Lecque at the free-throw line as a sophomore at Monsignor Scanlan. After his sophomore year, Lecque became one of the city's top secrets and started to make a huge buzz playing with the New York Lightning. But then a knee injury sustained in a summer league game in New York sidelined him for months. But on January 3rd, against Bishop Loughlin, Lecque came back fully healed. \"I actually thought it was over, but when they carried on, it was just a great feeling that I came back and I'm stronger than ever,\" says Lecque about coming back strong. He then went on a tear during the season and his one crowning moment came on February 19th in the CHSAA Bronx/Westchester Archdiocesan playoffs against St. Raymond, which had beaten the Crusaders twice before. With just a few seconds to go, Lecque let off a three-pointer which went in and stunned the St. Raymond's crowned as Scanlan won 58-57.

Lecque has made a name for himself on the premier sneaker circuit in the country, averaging 17 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. As of late, his offers have started to pile up. He has now been offered by New Mexico, Auburn, Texas Tech, Minnesota, Houston, Georgia, Wake Forest, Kansas State, St. John's, Rhode Island, Iona, Seton Hall, Colorado State, St. Louis, TCU, Florida, Georgia Tech & Tennessee. \"Southern Stampede was a great opportunity, it gave me a chance to showcase my talents and that was the choice I made,\" says Lecque about his spring season. For his amazing performances, he was named Breakout Performer for Session 1 of the EYBL in Hampton, Virginia and All-Honorable Mention by D-1 Circuit.

(Photo courtesy of Visions by Jeff/Jeffrey Armstrong) As for his next move, Lecque has decided to reclassify to the Class of 2019, and will do his remaining two years of high school at the Christ School in Arden, North Carolina. \"The Christ School is a really good school, you know, it's more about the education within. It's about more than basketball for me,\" says Lecque about his decision to transfer, \"I have to just play basketball and get my education.\" Now that Lecque has improved his stock and has decided to reclassify, the high school scene has two more years to see him throw down dunks, but also improve. Once high school is over and a Division I scholarship is in his hands, everyone will see another great performance on the college level from the kid they call, \"Rook.\" But for now, his plans are simple: \"Just showcase that I can play with the best in the world and to just be the best 2019 player in the country.\" Highlights of Jalen Lecque: Courtesy of Primetime Hoops.

Essex volleyball teams win double national success # Double national success for Essex volleyball teams ### Date Fri 15 Feb 19 Essex's volleyball teams have secured a clean sweep at the national finals. Both the men's and women's team took Volleyball England National Student Cup this year building on their achievements in 2018 when the men's team won the trophy and the women's team was a runner-up. The men's team was victorious against the University of Reading and the women's team defeated the University of East Anglia. Volleyball Performance Coach Alex Porter said: \"This is one of the most successful weeks in the Performance Volleyball Programme's history. \"The women's had won three silvers in the last four years and this was the first gold in the University's history, the men are now joint record holders after winning the title three years in a row.\" The Most Valuable Player Awards both went to stars of the Essex teams as Logan Zotovich won the men's prize and Katarina Raicevic received the honour in the women's competition.

Daily World Published 10:57 a.m. ET Oct. 5, 2013 | Updated 5:54 p.m. ET Oct. 5, 2013CLOSE Evan Moore, (Opelousas, La.) Daily World city editor, talks about his interview with Ray Mouton, who was defense lawyer for pedophile priest Gilbert Gauthe in the first widely publicized Catholic Church child molestation scandal. (Bill Decker) Bill Decker, The (Lafayette, La.) Daily Advertiser ## The Rev. Gilbert Gauthe molested at least 37 boys in 4 parishes. He was a priest for 11 years. A Catholic church is visible from the terrace of Ray Mouton's home in southwestern France.(Photo: Courtesy of M. Barrios) ### Story Highlights Gilbert Gauthe was born in 1945 in the small Louisiana town of NapoleonvilleBefore he turned 30, he had become a priest and started molesting young boys in southern LouisianaLawyer Ray Mouton knew Gauthe was guilty, learned he wasn't the only one On clear mornings he can see the steeple. It rises from a little russet-stone Catholic church in the village in southern France where Ray Mouton, former Louisiana lawyer-turned-expatriate-American author, now lives. STORY: Texas town home to pedophile priest The view from Mouton's terrace focuses squarely on that steeple as it cuts a line through the horizon, reaching heavenward against a backdrop of the Pyrenees, a symbol of solace, hope and inspiration to man. But Mouton has never been to Mass in that church. He never has heard a sermon there. Mouton no longer attends services — not since the case of the Rev. Gilbert Gauthe, whose horrific crimes against children in the Diocese of Lafayette set off a wave of scandal in 1985 that reached across the USA all the way to the Vatican; not since Mouton defended Gauthe and almost ruined his life in the process. Now, he enters churches only to light candles, candles for the children. Journey from top to bottom, back again Mouton is a man who had everything and lost it, a man who hit rock bottom then found a way back. Once a lawyer, he became a wanderer who watched his home, his family and his law practice fade away in an alcoholic haze, Mouton is now an author, a man who reinvented himself. Gauthe is a pedophile who was a priest, an unassuming man whose monstrous crimes in south Louisiana set off a worldwide avalanche of scandal in 1985 that continues to rock the Catholic Church today. In God's House is Mouton's latest book, a work of fiction mirroring reality so closely that Gauthe almost leers from its pages. Ray Mouton, former defense lawyer for Gilbert Gauthe and now an author, stands near his home in the Pyrenees in southwest France. (Photo: Courtesy of M. Barrios) Mouton grew up wealthy, the scion of an historically prominent, staunchly Catholic, South Louisiana family. The Moutons began their Louisiana heritage with Jean Mouton, founder of the settlement that eventually became Lafayette, La. They count a Civil War general, a governor, a U.S. senator and other prominent Louisiana figures among their ranks. Ray Mouton also made his mark as a star quarterback in high school. Two years later he ran off to Mexico with the prettiest girl in his sophomore college class, married her and went on to graduate from Louisiana State University law school. As a lawyer, Mouton poured himself into his cases with the same zeal that made him a star quarterback, sometimes going days without sleep while he was preparing for trial. It paid off. By the mid-1980s he had tried two personal injury cases that resulted in record verdicts and was involved in a number of other high profile trials. \"I had a significant media profile locally for a young lawyer,\" he said. He was known as a firebrand and he lived up to the reputation. Mouton drove flashy cars. He liked champagne. He, his wife and their three children lived on a sprawling estate in a remote corner of Lafayette Parish. \"We had 15 acres,\" Mouton said. \"We had a big home that was a replica of an 1850s Acadian farmhouse, a Cajun guest cottage, a large bass pond, stables, horses, a swimming pool, and landscaping. There were irises on the banks of the pond.\" Abused boy turns to priesthood Gauthe was none of those things. Born in 1945 into a poor farming family in Napoleonville, La., he was the eldest of eight children. An introvert and a poor student, he more or less strayed into the priesthood. After failing several classes at two seminaries, he was ordained in 1971. He might have remained obscure had he not been a predatory pedophile. As his crimes came to light and case after case was brought against him and the Lafayette Diocese, Gauthe's life was chronicled in multiple court records. Gilbert Gauthe in a 2010 mugshot. (Photo: Galveston County Jail) An older boy molested Gauthe around age 9. Gauthe preyed on boys of roughly the same age, the sons of his parishioners, scores of them. Though timid around adults, he could be a fiend with children, once telling a reluctant boy that if he told about their sexual encounters, Gauthe would kill his father and, as a priest, \"make sure he goes to hell.\" He told family members and others that he never felt any real commitment to the priesthood but confided to his brother Richard, another pedophile eventually arrested and jailed in Great Britain, that it offered unlimited access to young boys. Gauthe took advantage of that access and a pattern emerged. During a decade beginning in 1972, Gauthe moved from the Louisiana towns of Broussard to New Iberia to Abbeville to Henry, molesting boys in each location. The late Bishop Gerard Frey, then in charge of the Diocese of Lafayette and Gauthe's supervisor, repeatedly was told of Gauthe's crimes but responded only by moving the priest every time rumors began to spread. Frey also told victims' parents to have their sons go to confession and repent their participation in the sexual episodes. Then, he made Gauthe chaplain of the Boy Scouts. However, it all came to an end in 1984. That year, parents of Gauthe's victims brought a number of suits against the diocese. At first, all the plaintiffs settled out of court. Then the late J. Minos Simon, a crusty, garrulous Lafayette lawyer, refused to settle. Simon's suit became public, forcing the district attorney to file a criminal case against Gauthe, and Gauthe became the first Catholic priest in U.S. history to face indictment for multiple cases of child molestation. The Diocese of Lafayette suddenly needed a criminal defense lawyer, a Catholic who would have the church's interest at heart. It turned to one of the best. Defending the church he loved \"I took the case out of vanity and greed,\" Mouton said. \"I knew it would be a high-profile case and I knew the church had unlimited funds to defend it.\" Beyond that, Mouton said he waded into his defense of Gauthe with a certain naiveté. As a criminal defense lawyer, he thought he had seen the worst of humanity, but this was his mother church. Gauthe must be an aberration, he reasoned. \"I honestly believed the church was a repository of goodness,\" Mouton said. \"As it turns out, it wasn't. Judge Henry Politz in an undated file photo. (Photo: AP) \"When I decided to take that case, I destroyed my life, my family, my faith. In three years, I lost everything I held dear.\" Mouton's first meeting with his client was unnerving. \"No one would have believed this nondescript, mild-mannered, soft-spoken person could have done the things he was charged with,\" Mouton said. \"And then he began to speak about these things and being in that room with him was the creepiest experience of my life.\" Mouton believed that he was representing a true sex maniac and his strategy was to have Gauthe admit to his crimes and plead insanity. The list of victims had grown to 37 by then. An insanity defense would keep the victims from having to testify and Mouton hoped to have Gauthe serve out whatever term he got in a treatment facility. \"The church fought me at every turn,\" Mouton said. \"They wanted me to plead him out and make it go away.\" Eventually, so did Gauthe. Though Gauthe first seemed fearful of prison, in the midst of the legal proceedings Mouton noticed that his client had become complacent and seemed to have few worries about his fate. \"I didn't know it then, but Gilbert had (the late) Judge Henry Politz on his side,\" Mouton said. As the case progressed, Mouton's obsessive habits worked to his client's advantage but not his own. He would work days without sleeping, self-medicate with a bottle of vodka or gin, sleep fitfully and rise to begin again. As news of the case spread, Mouton and his family began to receive threats. Mouton's son was embroiled in fights in school about his father, and the lawyer's long hours began taking their toll on his marriage. His faith in the church, something he had never questioned, began to erode as well. As he dug into the Gauthe case, he found evidence that church officials had long known that Gauthe was a child molester. Worse, Mouton found evidence of first one and then another and another pedophile priest in the Lafayette Diocese. That number eventually rose to seven. And as he watched his health and his marriage slip away, Mouton began to lose something else, his unflinching faith in the church as the one institution of good. \"I didn't consider quitting. I couldn't quit,\" Mouton said. \"I felt somebody had to do something, do all in their power, to protect innocent children from bishops who covered up crimes of demented criminal priests who belonged in prison.\" Reporting on the problem nationwide As the Gauthe case wound toward a close, its publicity brought forward other victims of other priests across the country. Lawsuits against the church began to multiply. Gauthe's crimes alone would cost the diocese at least $10 million. Mouton joined with two priests, canon lawyer Father Thomas Doyle and the late Rev. Michael Peterson, a church psychiatrist who treated troubled priests, to write a report for the Vatican on the state of pedophilia in the U.S. church. Working over several months and traveling the country, the trio compiled a report that concluded that the problem of pedophilia was so widespread in the Catholic clergy that the cost in dollars eventually could reach $1 billion and would be a public relations nightmare. Gilbert Gauthe, center, is escorted to a waiting car by two Lafayette Parish Sheriff's deputies after being released from jail on Feb. 2, 2000, in Lafayette, La. Gauthe, an ex-priest who has admitted molesting numerous children, was released after prosecutors failed to convince a judge he should be tried for an alleged 1982 rape. (Photo: John Rowland, The (Alexandria, La.) Town Talk) The cost to the church would be staggering, they warned. The cost in human suffering could not be measured. Church leaders initially appeared thankful for the report, then turned their backs on it, Mouton said. Doyle, who served as chaplain to the U.S. Air Force until 2004, agreed. \"In the beginning, both Ray and I naively believed that when confronted with the truth that the church would do the right thing and act in accord with its teachings,\" Doyle said. \"At a minimum, we thought it would have the common decency and common sense to do all in its power to heal the wounds of innocent victims, and in the process remove criminal clerics from the ministry, reporting them to police authorities,\" Doyle said. \"How wrong we were. It shook my faith, and it shook Ray's.\" Mouton ended the Gauthe case and the report a ruined man. By 1987, his law practice was gone and his marriage had ended. The country estate sat vacant and Mouton was falling apart. \"I felt then as I do now that every bishop who has covered up a clerical crime belongs in prison with the priest,\" Mouton said. \"I knew no one in the church had ever done anything about this or ever would do anything about it. \"I worked, battling the diocese, the American church and the Vatican until I literally burned myself up spiritually, mentally, and physically.\" Mouton was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, the psychological driving wheel that can lead to great success or catastrophic failure. And he said he had another problem: \"I also was a full-blown alcoholic.\" Prison not hard time In prison, Gauthe led a charmed life. In October 1986, he pleaded guilty to 11 counts of child molestation and was sentenced to 20 years. Under a plea bargain that Mouton worked out, he was to get psychiatric treatment and was to be required to take Depo-Provera to diminish his sex drive. He was sent to David Wade Correctional Center in Homer, La., and the mantle of protection from Politz, at that point chief justice of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, followed him there. Beyond the curtain of foliage is the home of Gilbert Gauthe. He now lives as a registered sex offender in San Leon, Texas. (Photo: Evan Moore, (Opelousas, La.) Daily World) The bond between one of Louisiana's worst child molesters and one of its most powerful jurists was both real and puzzling. Politz was a giant in Louisiana's legal community, a former president of the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association, an officeholder on numerous boards and a man in whose name a scholarship has been established at the LSU law school. From the day that Gauthe was charged, Politz became his protector. In an interview in 1998, Politz said that it was the result of family ties that reached back to Napoleonville. \"My father and his grandfather sharecropped together in Napoleonville,\" Politz told the Houston Chronicle. \"When my father died at a very early age, Gilbert's grandfather befriended my mother. \"Gilbert's mother and my sister were best friends. It's as simple as that.\" Largely because of Politz's intervention, Gauthe was given his own air-conditioned studio at Wade where he painted signs and portraits. The walls of that studio were glass, so guards could observe Gauthe. But he soon hung portraits on the walls, hiding himself and his teenage assistants from sight He was allowed to leave the prison for extended furloughs to visit his mother. Politz visited him regularly and, on occasion, took him and prison officials to lunch at a nearby country club. In September 1995, Gauthe was released from prison 11 years early. He moved to Polk County, Texas, to the tiny community of Ace where he was arrested months later and charged with molesting a 3-year-old boy. Once again, Politz stepped in. Robert C. Bennett, a powerhouse Houston lawyer who practices primarily in federal courts, arrived in Polk County to defend Gauthe. With Bennett's help, a lack of cooperation from Louisiana authorities and what the district attorney described as a weak case, Gauthe was allowed to plead no contest to a nonsexual charge of injury to a child. He was given seven years probation. He later moved to Waskom, Texas, on the Texas-Louisiana border, then south of Houston to Galveston County. By then, Gauthe's mentor was gone. Politz died in 2002, and in 2008, Gauthe was arrested for failing to register in Galveston County as a sex offender. He served two years and was released in April 2010. Mouton takes back control of his life As Gauthe was painting in his prison studio, Mouton was running with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. He still had money and, with his life at a crossroads, he headed for Europe. \"I quit drinking,\" he said. \"My sobriety date is Nov. 15, 1987. I have not had a sip of alcohol since.\" &amp;amp;lt;!--iframe--&amp;amp;gt; Instead, he found release running 2 feet in front of the horns of a 1,500-pound beast that wanted to kill him. The running of the bulls is a tradition across Spain, but particularly in Pamplona. There, a dozen or more fighting bulls are loosed in the streets and members of the crowd run in front of them to test their courage. \"I first attended Fiesta De San Fermin in Pamplona in July 1970 and ran with the bulls for the first time that summer,\" Mouton said. He did it again after the Gauthe case and continued the practice until 1998, when he fell, breaking an arm and almost dying from a subsequent heart attack. He found another release as well. Mouton had always written: essays, short stories, observations. In writing he found an outlet for the manic obsession that drove him in law, but one that did not threaten to kill him. Mouton began spending most of his time in Europe. In 2002, he published Pamplona, Running the bulls bars and barrios in Fiesta de San Fermin. The book, replete with stunning photographs and vivid descriptions, has been praised as the definitive account of Pamplona's fiesta and running of the bulls. More recently, he has written another book, In God's House, a sprawling novel about a Louisiana lawyer who defends a pedophile priest and almost loses everything in the process. \"This is a work of fiction, but, obviously, it wouldn't be the same if I hadn't lived through what I did,\" he said. \"It's dedicated to the victims, children around the world who are survivors of clergy abuse and those who did not survive.\" The book has done well in England, Ireland and Scotland, and is available on amazon.com. It does not yet have a U.S. publisher, and Mouton said he intends to begin searching for one this fall. The church won't welcome the book. A spokesman for the Lafayette Diocese said the diocese was not aware that the novel had been published and would have no comment on it. Now, Mouton spends most of his time at his home in southern France, where he is working on several other novels. In the mornings, he often walks out on his terrace and looks across the valley to the little church below. Mouton no longer considers himself a member of the Catholic Church or any organized religion. Still, old habits die hard, and once in a while, he quietly slips into the little church alone. \"I only go into churches to light candles and pray while lighting them,\" Mouton said. \"To me, the perfect prayer is when one focuses all of their energy on another in the moment when a candle is lit,\" he said. \"I light candles for people I know who have troubles of any kind in their life, especially those who are ill. \"But I always light the first candle for all the innocent children whose names I will never know,\" Mouton said, \"all those children who have been abused.\" Evan Moore, city editor at the (Opelousas, La.) Daily World, previously covered the Gauthe case extensively for the Houston Chronicle. &amp;lt;!--iframe--&amp;gt; Since Gilbert Gauthe The case of pedophile priest Gilbert Gauthe from 1985 to 1986 in Lafayette, La., was the first of many. In his wake was a bevy of civil and criminal cases against priests and dioceses. BishopAccoutability.org, a nonprofit Massachusetts organization, maintains the most extensive records on such cases. The following facts are based on their data: • Between 1984 and 2009 more than 3,000 civil lawsuits involving pedophile priests were filed in the United States. • More than $3 billion in awards and settlements have been made between 1984 and 2008. • Between 1986 and 2009, 37 civil cases went to trial. • Between 2001 and 2010, the Vatican acknowledged that 600 priests accused of sexual abuse had been removed from the clergy worldwide, half at their own request and half by papal decree. Of those, 325 have been identified in the USA. • Data from the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops includes 16,795 persons who have reported being abused as minors by priests since 2004.

Perennial Oscar bridesmaid Kate Winslet and first-time nominee Penelope Cruz fly the flag for the younger generation in their bid to bring home Oscar. Penelope Cruz Dame Judi Dench Dame Helen Mirren Meryl Streep Kate Winslet PENELOPE CRUZ - VOLVER Cruz won a best actress award at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival film clip Though Cruz's Oscar nomination may come as a surprise to those who first came upon the actress in the much-anticipated but lamentable Captain Corelli's Mandolin, fans in Spain know differently. The 32-year-old actress has been a star in her native country since her revealing film debut in the 1992 erotic comedy Jamon, Jamon. Born in Madrid, to a shopkeeper and a hairdresser, Cruz trained as a ballet dancer before catching the acting bug. Her Mediterranean good looks won her many admirers, but it was not until her performance in Pedro Almodovar's Carne Tremula (Live Flesh) that her talent became apparent. Alejandro Amenabar's Abre Los Ojos (later remade in Hollywood as Vanilla Sky) won her further plaudits, but it was her role as a wayward nun in Almodovar's Todo Sobre Mi Madre (All About My Mother) that brought her to Hollywood's attention. The move to Tinseltown brought her celebrity boyfriends - notably Tom Cruise, whom she met on the set of Vanilla Sky just as his marriage to Nicole Kidman was collapsing. But while it advanced her fame, it did her talent no favours. Her English-language performances proved halting and unconvincing, and she was reduced to playing eye candy in films like Blow and Sahara. Ironically, it took a return to Spain and director Almodovar to secure her first Oscar nomination as the troubled single mother coming to terms with her past. \"The most difficult thing in the world is to start a career known only for your looks, and then to try to become a serious actress,\" Cruz once said. With Volver, she may finally have turned the tide. DAME JUDI DENCH - NOTES ON A SCANDAL Dame Judi co stars with fellow Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett film clip Dame Judi is no stranger to the Oscars. Indeed, the actress has become as ubiquitous as her rival Meryl Streep - with six nominations in less than a decade. This includes the best supporting actress Oscar she won for her cameo role as Elizabeth I in Shakespeare in Love in 1999. Long celebrated at home, Hollywood recognition came relatively late for the 72-year-old actress. Dame Judi, who was born to a family with acting connections in York, has won nine Bafta awards in a career that has spanned half a century. Awarded the prestigious Companion of Honour in 2005, she is regarded as a first-class stage actress. Her comedic presence on the small screen, in TV sitcoms A Fine Romance and As Time Goes By, has also garnered awards. But her first Oscar nomination did not come until 1998, for her role as Queen Victoria in Mrs Brown. Chocolat, Iris and Mrs Henderson Presents secured the actress subsequent nominations. Ironically, however, it is her role as M in the Bond films that has won the actress worldwide attention. She claims she takes roles \"because someone asked me to\", but her turn as an embittered schoolteacher in Notes on a Scandal only serves to emphasise her versatility. DAME HELEN MIRREN - THE QUEEN Dame Helen was the first choice of director Stephen Frears film clip So laden with awards is Dame Helen Mirren for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II that missing out on the ultimate film prize would be a shock akin to Crash stealing the spoils from Brokeback Mountain last year. The 61-year-old actress, feted in the UK for her TV role as detective Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect, has never won an Oscar. Her two nominations, in the supporting actress category, include Gosford Park and The Madness of King George - in which she played Queen Charlotte, another royal role. Indeed, monarchs are proving something of a talisman for Dame Helen, with a double win at the Golden Globes for The Queen and her title role in Channel 4 drama Elizabeth I. Yet the outspoken Mirren, whose early career was marked by a disregard for propriety and a penchant for nudity, initially seemed an unlikely choice to play the British monarch. Roles in films such as The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, The Long Good Friday and even 2003's Calendar Girls seemed a world way from playing the Queen. Married to Californian director Taylor Hackford, whose films include An Officer and a Gentleman and Ray, the pair have settled in Los Angeles - a far cry from Windsor. But the actress has stunned critics with her vulnerable yet dignified performance, gaining stature and statuettes as the film awards season has progressed. She even dedicated her award to the monarch herself at the recent Golden Globe awards. \"I think you fell in love with her, not me,\" she told the assembled audience. It was a regal gesture that cemented her bid for the Oscar crown - a crown that looks to be hers for the taking. MERYL STREEP - THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA Streep can currently be seen in the late Robert Altman's last film film clip Oscar favourite Meryl Streep racks up her 14th nomination with her performance as bitchy magazine editor Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada. Streep's reputation has been built on an almost uncanny ability to inhabit her characters. But the 57-year-old actress appears to be anything but a diva. The mother-of-four is known for her down-to-earth attitude and is beloved by actors and directors alike. \"I really, really depend on the other actors for the confirmation of who I think I am,\" said the star of Out of Africa and The Deer Hunter. She has twice won the Oscar - as best supporting actress in 1979's Kramer vs Kramer, and as best actress in the harrowing Sophie's Choice (1983). But while it is her dramatic work that has invariably been singled out, recent years have revealed a keen grasp of comedy. With nominations for 2002's Adaptation and her current performance in The Devil Wears Prada - which won the actress her sixth Golden Globe in January - it seems even the Academy is coming round to a more light-hearted Streep. KATE WINSLET - LITTLE CHILDREN Winslet is the youngest actress to earn five Oscar nominations film clip Despite earning her fifth Oscar nomination, Oscar bridesmaid Kate Winslet has yet to win an Academy Award - and the 2007 gong looks like a long-shot. Winslet gives another powerful performance as a disillusiioned suburban mother in Todd Field's Little Children, effortlessly adopting an American accent and proving once again why she is arguably the best actress of her generation. The 31-year-old has delivered consistently strong performances since her memorable film debut in Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures in 1994. Initially her success in Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility - which won her her first Oscar nomination - suggested she might end up, like Helena Bonham Carter, corseted to period drama. Then came Titanic, which launched Winslet in Hollywood - earning her another Oscar nomination and making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy nods. But constant press attention about her weight saw Winslet shake off her newfound fame and dive into indie movie Hideous Kinky, where she met first husband James Threapleton. She resurfaced on the Academy's radar with 2001's Iris, in which she co-starred with Oscar rival Dame Judi Dench - and, in 2005, with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Now in her thirties, with a newfound confidence, the mother-of-two has settled down with American Beauty director Sam Mendes. \"I don't believe that actors and actresses should look perfect in movies,\" she told the BBC. \"It's important to hang on to the sense of reality.\" E- mail this to a friend Printable version FILM AWARDS 2007 Oscars 2007 In-depth coverage of this year's Academy Awards ACADEMY AWARDS NEWS Dame Judi playing down hopes Craig to present an Oscar The Oscars shortlist in full Stars talk about nominations Oscars highlights OSCARS SPOTLIGHT Guide to best film nominees Vote for your Oscar winners Oscar movie lines quiz Quick guide: Academy Awards Hollywood ceremonies explained OTHER AWARDS NEWS China film wins top Berlin award Mirren adds Bafta to awards haul British success dominates Baftas Sunshine scoops surprise film win Stone's sequel leads Razzies race Dame Helen reigns over Globes Globe winners clips Bafta winner clips HAVE YOUR SAY Film fans panel on nominations What do you think of the shortlist?

The Wars of the Roses have been long renowned as a feud between the houses of York and Lancaster – but can the conflict instead be seen as a deadly grudge between York and Beaufort? Nathen Amin examines the relationships and rivalries between key figures of the two houses… November 27, 2017 at 2:13 pm The 15th-century civil war known as the Wars of the Roses is rightly regarded as one of the most complex and unquestionably captivating periods in European history. It was a three-decade long, destructive conflict that tore the upper echelons of the English nobility apart in a manner not witnessed since the Anarchy in the mid-12th century, that equally fierce war of succession between Empress Matilda and her cousin Stephen of Blois. Starting with the very first skirmish, fought fiercely through the narrow streets of St Albans on 22 May 1455, through to the bloody battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485, the Wars of the Roses have long become renowned for the deadly feud between the houses of York and Lancaster, the white rose and the red, driven apart by unshakable enmity and unrepentant hatred. On closer inspection, however, it could be argued the conflict largely stemmed from the rivalry between the heads of the houses of York and Beaufort, with Henry VI, the Lancastrian king, just a witless onlooker. Nathen Amin will be speaking on Henry VII and the Pretenders to the Tudor Crown at our Kings and Queens Weekend in March 2019. Find out more here By 1450, several prominent families jostled for supremacy at the apex of English society, including the Nevilles, Percys, Staffords, Bourchiers, Courtenays and Hollands. The two most prominent figures, however, were the heads of the houses of York and Beaufort – Richard, Duke of York, and Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. The breakdown in relations between the pair is a story of jealousy and ambition between implacable enemies, one which played a significant role in dragging England into a horrific civil war. ### Richard, Duke of York The respective rises of York and Somerset was surprising, given the differences in both men's upbringing, but nonetheless the great rivals grew to harbour the same all-encompassing ambitions. Richard of York had an illustrious lineage, descended from Edward III twice over through the great king's second son Lionel, Duke of Clarence (though in the female line) and fourth son Edmund, Duke of York. It was a pedigree that arguably provided York with a superior claim to the throne than the incumbent Lancastrian dynasty, themselves descended from Edward III's third son, John of Gaunt (albeit crucially in the direct male line). Born on 21 September 1411, York's early life was tainted by his father's execution for treason by Henry IV when he was three, although he subsequently benefited as heir from the demise of his paternal uncle Edward, Duke of York, in 1415 and his maternal uncle Edward Mortimer, Earl of March, in 1425. When he reached 21 in 1432, Richard came into full custody of his inheritance, an array of titles that included the Duchy of York as well as the Earldoms of Cambridge, Ulster and March. Fully expecting a career in front-line politics, York was instead deployed to France in 1436 to serve as lieutenant, a tenure which finally expired in 1445. Having been deprived his lucrative post overseas by the king's failure to renew his lieutenancy, York returned to England where he soon grew outspoken against the plans of Henry VI and his chief councillor William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, to attempt peace with France. As a result, York was appointed lieutenant of Ireland in 1447, a position intended to remove him from the political scene. Richard Duke Of York, c 1450. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Departing in June 1449, he wouldn't remain across the Irish Sea for long. The following year, widespread anger at the loss of Normandy and growing political unrest created a volatile situation in England which manifested itself in the brutal extrajudicial executions of Adam Moleyns, Bishop of Chichester, and the Duke of Suffolk. In June 1450, a popular uprising led by a shadowy figure named Jack Cade caused further disarray throughout the land, prompting the celebrated return of York to the mainland in September, assuming the mantle as champion of the common man. It was a return that set him directly against the man who had replaced Suffolk as the king's second-in-command: Edmund Beaufort. ### Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset Unlike York, Somerset could not boast of a considerable inheritance and a collection of noble titles, but he did share descent from Edward III. The Beauforts were an illegitimate brood born to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and a third son of King Edward. When Gaunt's eldest legitimate heir, Henry of Bolingbroke usurped the throne in 1399 to become Henry IV – the first Lancastrian sovereign – his Beaufort half-siblings, who had been retrospectively legitimised more than two decades after their birth, rose with him. Edmund's father John Beaufort, one of Henry IV's half-brothers, had been raised to the earldom of Somerset in 1397, a title which passed to his own heir Henry after the first earl's death in 1410 and consequently to his second son John after Henry's premature demise in 1418. The younger John Beaufort spent most of his life in French captivity after being caught after the battle of Baugé in 1421, with his younger brother Edmund overseeing the family interests back in England. The younger John Beaufort, the 3rd Earl, was finally ransomed in 1438 and soon incurred the enduring enmity of Richard of York after he led an army into France in 1443, receiving men, money and resources denied to York, the lieutenant across the Channel. When John, elevated to the dukedom of Somerset that year to rival York's status, failed to take advantage of the opportunity granted him, he returned to England and died in uncertain circumstances the following year, leaving Edmund to once again pick up the pieces. The seeds of discord between York and the Beauforts had, however, already been sown, a feud which swiftly accelerated over the next decade. When York's tenure as lieutenant in France ended in 1445, the lucrative post was handed to John's younger brother Edmund, who was also raised from earl to duke of Somerset, a sign of his increasing prominence. Somerset's spell in France, however, proved disastrous and by 1450, he had overseen the complete loss of all English possessions in Normandy, including York's favoured fortress of Rouen, the mightiest in the region. Somerset's reputation collapsed amongst some of the nobility in England, particularly York, although he was infallible in the eyes of the man who mattered: Henry VI. When York returned from Ireland in September 1450, a clash with Somerset was inevitable. Quite simply, both dukes could not coexist peacefully, nor did either have any inclination to do so. York's intention was to assume command of the government on behalf of the unstable king, replacing the fallen Suffolk and re-establishing good governance and financial probity to the realm. York, however, was politely rebuffed, only to frustratingly see Edmund Beaufort handed such authority. ### Rising rivalries between York and Beaufort In the November 1450 parliament, York's chamberlain William Oldhall attacked Somerset as speaker of the Commons, alleging the duke was abusing his position to the \"grete hurt, and trouble of the liege people of this your Reame\". Oldhall demanded Somerset \"be removed from youre most noble presense, persone and estate\" by 1 December, and forbidden from coming within 12 miles of the king. King Henry ignored such demands, however, which almost led to Somerset's lynching in an event which evoked memories of Suffolk's own extrajudicial execution six months earlier. On the evening of 1 December 1450, the date by which the Commons had demanded Somerset be removed from the king's presence, the Beaufort duke was feasting at the Blackfriars Priory in Ludgate when several armed soldiers attempted to break through the doors. The duke fled in panic through the priory until he reached a small boat on the nearby Thames, embarking before he could be seized by his pursuers. Somerset's flight was so sudden he was \"robbyde of alle hys goodys, and hys jewyllys were takyn and borne away\". Ten days later, his family seat at Corfe Castle in Dorset was ransacked by a Yorkist retainer, and for his protection, the duke was placed in the Tower of London. A political rivalry was rapidly descending into a blood-feud. Matters worsened in early 1452 when York, infuriated by Somerset's attempts to take revenge on Oldhall, raised an army to counter the \"envy, malice and untruth\" of his rival, who \"ever prevaileth and ruleth about the King's person\". Persuaded to stand down before he led his men into battle against a royal army, York was humiliated when forced to swear fealty to the king outside St Paul's like a common traitor, and trudged back to his estates whilst Somerset's supremacy continued unabated. In October 1453, Henry VI collapsed into a catatonic stupor probably triggered by the loss of Aquitaine after 300 years in English possession, and York was recalled by parliament. With popular support amongst the commons, York was appointed Protector and Somerset was imprisoned, a state of affairs that remained in place for the next 14 months. Henry regained his senses on Christmas Day 1454, and by February 1455 Somerset had reclaimed his erstwhile position. York, meanwhile, was unceremoniously dismissed from office. His response was decisive. The duke again raised an army, but this time there would be no submission. On 22 May 1455, as the royal household approached St Albans fronted by the king and his Beaufort right-hand, York was waiting, buoyed by the Neville father-and-son earls of Salisbury and Warwick. When the attack came, it was swift and fierce, with one man above all targeted. Edmund Beaufort was cornered underneath a pub with the sign of a castle (as an old prophecy had allegedly foretold) and despite a valiant resistance, was cut down in his prime. At last, York had emerged victorious against his great rival. ### Edward IV and Henry Beaufort, duke of Somerset St Albans didn't mark the end of the York-Beaufort rivalry. Nor could it, for following generations bore grudges of their own with good reason. Edmund Beaufort's heir was Henry Beaufort, an impetuous youth wholly preoccupied with avenging his father's death. In October 1456, the new Duke of Somerset, barely 20-years-old, attempted to ambush York at a council meeting, and over the next few years remained hostile towards the man he understandably held responsible for Edmund's assassination. Political revenge for young Somerset occurred with York's flight from England in October 1459, but physical revenge was far more satisfying. On 30 December 1460, Henry Beaufort outmanoeuvred York outside the latter's Sandal Castle near Wakefield, and the mighty duke was surrounded and killed. York's head was spiked upon a City of York gateway. Just as Henry of Somerset sought and achieved vengeance for his father, so too did York's own son, the 18-year-old force of nature that was Edward of March. Edward wasted little time, and on Palm Sunday in a snowstorm at Towton destroyed Somerset's Lancastrian army, scattering his enemies and claiming the throne as Edward IV, the first monarch of the House of York. Somerset was attacked in Edward's first parliament for acting with \"extreme and insatiate malice and violence\" in slaying the new king's father. After Edward's Yorkist forces destroyed Somerset's Lancastrian forces at Towton, he claimed the throne as Edward IV. Portrait by an unkown artist. (Photo by VCG Wilson/Corbis via Getty Images) Thereafter, the Beaufort duke focused on reclaiming the crown for his Lancastrian kin, and campaigned with considerable vigour in the northern parts of England – capturing, losing, and capturing again, several Northumbrian castles. Edward had successfully quelled resistance throughout England but struggled to fend of his Beaufort foe in the north-east. In a curious twist to the relentless York-Beaufort rivalry, the king extended an olive branch to the duke, who surprisingly accepted, defecting from the hopeless Lancastrian cause and attaching himself to the ascendant Yorkist regime. Somerset was pardoned, and the two erstwhile enemies became fast friends, riding and hunting together, and even sharing a bed. The king, it was said, \"lovyed hym welle\". And yet, Somerset soon defected for a second time. It was a decision that would cost him his life. On 15 May 1464, another unit of Somerset's army was routed near Hexham in Northumberland by a Yorkist force led by John Neville, Marquess Montagu, and the Beaufort duke was executed shortly thereafter in the market square. This second-generation Beaufort-York rivalry between the sons of Edmund Beaufort and Richard of York would stumble on for another seven years, with Henry Beaufort's resistance to Yorkist rule assumed by his two younger brothers, Edmund and John. Both were killed fighting against King Edward at Tewkesbury in 1471. ### Richard III and Henry Tudor Although the male Beaufort line ended at Tewkesbury, there would be one last flurry of activity in the three-decade-long York-Beaufort rivalry, a violent dispute unquestionably at the heart of the wider dynastic conflicts tearing the kingdom apart. This last confrontation would not feature a Beaufort by name, however, but rather one bearing the name Tudor – Henry Tudor. Richard III controversially assumed kingship in 1783. (Photo by: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images) Richard III had controversially assumed kingship in the aftermath of the political machinations of 1483, a rise which divided the alienated household of his brother Edward IV. Those who didn't support Richard's alleged deposing of Edward's young namesake heir, the 12-year-old Edward V, and 10-year-old Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, elected to flee abroad to Brittany, where they sensationally proposed Henry Tudor as an alternative king, with the added provision he married Edward's daughter Elizabeth of York. Henry's claim was slight, and derived from his mother Margaret Beaufort, the niece of Edmund Beaufort and cousin of Henry Beaufort, those erstwhile foes of the Yorks. Although Tudor by name, Henry unquestionably took considerable pride in his Beaufort pedigree. He was successful in wresting the throne from Richard at the battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485, and thereafter liberally employed the Beaufort portcullis as one of his chief royal badges, arguably second only to the red-and-white union rose he devised to symbolise the union of the two warring houses. Henry VII employed the Beaufort portcullis as one of his chief royal badges, says Nathen Amin. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) The Wars of the Roses occurred for a myriad of reasons that have been explored in many histories, from the fallout arising from the deposition of Richard II, to the recriminations after the loss of France and divisive factional feuds which a weak king in Henry VI failed to quell. Throughout the 30 years of brutal warfare, however, from the first battle at St Albans in 1455 to the iconic showdown between Richard III and Henry VII in 1485, one constant remained the driving factor throughout – the deep enmity between the houses of York and Beaufort.

The Friends of Castle Cove Beach Charity say the grand opening of the steps down to Castle Cove Beach will be this Saturday. And cutting the ribbon will be Brian Wilkins, 82, who has been using the beach since 1938 and been an enthusiastic supporter of the campaign to get it back open. The area has special memories for him – he remembers climbing through barbed wire on the sands to go swimming in 1940, watched ships leaving for D-Day in 1944, got engaged to wife Joan by the pier, and worked there hiring out deckchairs. Mr Wilkins featured in the Echo on Monday after being knocked into Weymouth Harbour by his mobility scooter. The steps have been unofficially open for the last two weeks. \"We're finally here,\" said Steve Elsworth from the Friends. \"The steps are beautiful. It's wonderful to be back on the beach again, and the public reaction has been ecstatic.\" Building the steps was the last hurdle to restoring full access to the popular beach. Castle Cove has been blocked off for more than five years although it has been accessible at low tide by walking along the coast. The footpath to the beach from Old Castle Road was closed by Dorset County Council but has since been partially reopened. Subsidence prompted the removal of an access staircase down to the sands. The Friends, with support from the community, have been working on restoring access. Local firm David R. White Ltd constructed the new wooden steps, which are similar to the steps that was removed in 2013, but are mounted on scaffold poles so that they can be dismantled and rebuilt if the land starts to move. Mr Elsworth said: \"A lot of people have helped us to build these steps. \"We need to thank the community for getting behind us so enthusiastically, both Weymouth and Dorset Councils and their officers, local businesses which have donated money, and the landowners for leasing us the land. But the biggest thank you goes to our supporters who have been rock-solid.\" He added: \"The steps are a remembrance of people we love, and a welcome to our children, grandchildren, and generations to come. \"The beach has been enjoyed by the public for the past 100 years; we hope they will be able to enjoy it for a hundred years more.\" The steps will be opened at 1pm on Easter Saturday, April 20. Everyone is encouraged to wear brightly-coloured clothing or fancy dress. There will be games for children, and then a mass swim in the sea.

That doesn't stop it from enjoying a vigorous, if deadly, sex life Quentin Wheeler Sun 15 Mar 2015 03.00 EDT Last modified on Wed 21 Mar 2018 20.16 EDT Threatened by climate change: Antechinus arktos. Photograph: Gary Cranitch, Queensland Museum A beautiful new species of carnivorous marsupial has been discovered in far south-eastern Queensland and adjacent north-eastern New South Wales. Isolated at high altitude on the Tweed volcanic caldera, in areas of high rainfall, the distinctness of the Black-tailed Antechinus had escaped scientists until now. The genus Antechinus includes 15 species from Australia. Short-haired with large ears, long whiskers and a pointed snout, these marsupials somewhat resemble shrews in general appearance. Antechinus are small, measuring nose-to-tail from 12 to 20cm and weighing no more than 180g. Males are larger than females and newborns tiny, weighing in at about 4g. The number of surviving young in a litter varies from four to 14, depending on how many teats the mother has in her pouch. Gestation is rapid, taking about four weeks. Antechinus are in the family Dasyuridae – carnivorous marsupials. The family includes 76 species, limited to Australia and New Guinea. Among them are other small and similarly mouse-like species, but also the cat-sized quolls and the Tasmanian devil, which for their size have the most powerful jaws of any mammal. While diets vary, occasionally including fruits, pollen and vertebrates, most dasyurids are predominantly insectivorous. Specimens of the new species, Antechinus arktos, were previously known to mammalogists but had been falsely assumed to belong to a common and widely distributed mainland subspecies of the Dusky Antechinus, A swainsonii mimetes. Andrew M Baker and Thomas Y Mutton of the Queensland University of Technology, with co-authors Harry B Hines of the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and Steve Van Dyck of the Queensland Museum, have clarified the evolutionary significance of the Black-tailed Antechinus and called attention to its probably threatened status. Baker and his colleagues, noticing the yellow-orange colouration around the eyes and rump of the new species, as well as its black tail and hind feet, suspected that it might be more than a mere colour variant of Dusky Antechinus. A mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that populations of A arktos differ from those of A swainsonii by 10%, a large, species-sized gap between two supposed populations of a single species. Photograph: Gary Cranitch, Queensland Museum Armed with this genetic insight, the scientists reexamined anatomical details, confirming several consistent differences. The more vibrant yellow-orange markings on the upper and lower eyelids and cheeks in front of the ears, the similarly coloured rump, and the evenly black hind feet and tail stand in contrast to the Dusky Antechnus. A swainsonii has a more uniformly coloured body with brownish-grey hair; its hind feet and tail have brown fur. As well as having a very limited geographic distribution, A arktos appears to be locally rare. In spite of evidence that these animals will readily enter traps, extensive efforts to capture them were largely unsuccessful: in 2013-2014 10,000 traps were deployed with only 10 individuals found at a single site. More disturbingly, specimens were not found at some lower-altitude sites where they had once been documented to exist, suggesting that their range may be shrinking. The team reporting the new species fears that climate change is having an impact on populations and that a continued warming trend will place them at even greater risk as they have nowhere left to run, being at the very summit of the World Heritage-listed rainforest of Springbrook. Their recommendation is that the Black-tailed Antechinus be considered endangered and that field studies of its status be continued as they race against time to save the species from extinction. Like other members of its genus, A arktos is short-lived and semelparous, that is, males reproduce only once in their lifetime. Males and females are promiscuous, often enthusiastically so, with copulation lasting up to 14 hours. At the end of the one-to three-week mating period, all males drop dead – victims of raging testosterone, which causes a malfunction in the stress-hormone cutoff switch. As a result, their immune system shuts down, their hair falls out, they become infested with ticks and mites and death inevitably follows, from internal bleeding or infection. When females give birth a couple of weeks later, not a single male is left alive to help rear the young. Offspring in a single litter are often fathered by multiple males as the female is capable of storing sperm for a few days prior to fertilisation.

Speaking exclusively to Kerrang!, METALLICA drummer Lars Ulrich told the magazine how much respect the Bay Area thrashers have for the Brit metal masters. \"IRON MAIDEN are 10 per cent cooler than every other band,\" says Ulrich. \"From their relationship with their fans, to their album covers to their stages, to their live presentation, to their photos whatever they did was always cooler than what everyone else did! I have always had an incredible amount of respect and admiration for them and obviously getting a chance to be part of this CD feels like that has come a full circle. We played 'Remember Tomorrow' as it was basically the blueprint for songs like 'Fade To Black' and 'Welcome Home (Sanitarium)', and some of the more epic ballady type of songs that METALLICA had done later. We had so much fun jamming with this! We put a bit of an intro on it, to give it a bit of a METALLICA stamp, and we are super pleased with how it has turned out. \" MACHINE HEAD frontman Robb Flynn is equally excited to be a part of this project. \"When I was a kid IRON MAIDEN were a very big deal to me and the influence they had on MACHINE HEAD has been huge,\" he reveals. \"We decided to cover 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' for this CD because it's just such a great song, in fact it's a classic! I just love the way the vocal line goes up and down, so dramatic.\" Metal heroes TRIVIUM, are happy to admit their own brand of heavy riffage could never have existed without MAIDEN's worldwide influence. \"IRON MAIDEN helped create what we know as heavy metal,\" states frontman Matt Heafy. \"Their influence can be heard on classic and contemporary bands alike; their fanbase spans across the youngest and newest of heavy music recruits all the way to the diehard, life-long metal elite. We chose to play the track 'Iron Maiden' off their first album, as the song that screamed out our love for them musically, and we knew it would be a really fun song to jam out in the studio. It was an honour to be able to play one of IRON MAIDEN's tracks and have the opportunity to contribute to this amazing CD. We hope everyone has as much fun listening to it as we did making it!\" Meanwhile, AVENGED SEVENFOLD who will be supporting MAIDEN at their upcoming Twickenham Stadium show on July 5 say they are \"honored\" to be part of this Kerrang!-arranged tribute. \"MAIDEN are by far the best live band in the world and their music is timeless,\" says vocalist M. Shadows. \"This also gives us a chance to expose this great song to some of our younger fans who maybe aren't as familiar with IRON MAIDEN.\" The arrival of Kerrang!'s \"Maiden Heaven\" CD coincides with IRON MAIDEN's European leg of their Somewhere Back In Time World Tour and follows on from the release of their own collection \"Somewhere Back In Time: The Best Of 80-89\". \"MAIDEN much appreciate and are very flattered by all the time spent on this by a lot of great bands,\" says IRON MAIDEN's manager Rod Smallwood, \"and would like to thank them, and also Kerrang!, for the honour. Thanks, everyone!\" The track listing for \"Maiden Heaven\" is as follows: 01. BLACK TIDE - Prowler 02. METALLICA - Remember Tomorrow 03. AVENGED SEVENFOLD - Flash Of The Blade 04.

Board of Education - HISTORY  AUTHOR: History.com Editors  PUBLISHED DATETIME: 2009-10-27T07:09:50-04:00 # Brown v. Board of Education Author:History.com Editors ## Contents SEPARATE BUT EQUAL BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION VERDICT LITTLE ROCK NINE IMPACT OF BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION Sources Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka was a landmark 1954 Supreme Court case in which the justices ruled unanimously that racial segregation of children in public schools was unconstitutional. Brown v. Board of Education was one of the cornerstones of the civil rights movement, and helped establish the precedent that \"separate-but-equal\" education and other services were not, in fact, equal at all. ## SEPARATE BUT EQUAL In 1896, the Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that racially segregated public facilities were legal, so long as the facilities for blacks and whites were equal. ADVERTISEMENTThanks for watching! The ruling constitutionally sanctioned laws barring African Americans from sharing the same buses, schools and other public facilities as whites—known as \"Jim Crow\" laws—and established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine that would stand for the next six decades. But by the early 1950s, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was working hard to challenge segregation laws in public schools, and had filed lawsuits on behalf of plaintiffs in states such as South Carolina, Virginia and Delaware. In the case that would become most famous, a plaintiff named Oliver Brown filed a class-action suit against the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, in 1951, after his daughter, Linda Brown, was denied entrance to Topeka's all-white elementary schools. In his lawsuit, Brown claimed that schools for black children were not equal to the white schools, and that segregation violated the so-called \"equal protection clause\" of the 14th Amendment, which holds that no state can \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" ADVERTISEMENTThanks for watching!ADVERTISEMENTThanks for watching! The case went before the U.S. District Court in Kansas, which agreed that public school segregation had a \"detrimental effect upon the colored children\" and contributed to \"a sense of inferiority,\" but still upheld the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. ## BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION VERDICT When Brown's case and four other cases related to school segregation first came before the Supreme Court in 1952, the Court combined them into a single case under the name Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. Thurgood Marshall, the head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, served as chief attorney for the plaintiffs. (Thirteen years later, President Lyndon B. Johnson would appoint Marshall as the first black Supreme Court justice.) At first, the justices were divided on how to rule on school segregation, with Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson holding the opinion that the Plessy verdict should stand. But in September 1953, before Brown v. Board of Education was to be heard, Vinson died, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower replaced him with Earl Warren, then governor of California. Displaying considerable political skill and determination, the new chief justice succeeded in engineering a unanimous verdict against school segregation the following year. In the decision, issued on May 17, 1954, Warren wrote that \"in the field of public education the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place,\" as segregated schools are \"inherently unequal.\" As a result, the Court ruled that the plaintiffs were being \"deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.\" ## LITTLE ROCK NINE In its verdict, the Supreme Court did not specify how exactly schools should be integrated, but asked for further arguments about it. In May 1955, the Court issued a second opinion in the case (known as Brown v. Board of Education II), which remanded future desegregation cases to lower federal courts and directed district courts and school boards to proceed with desegregation \"with all deliberate speed.\" Though well intentioned, the Court's actions effectively opened the door to local judicial and political evasion of desegregation. While Kansas and some other states acted in accordance with the verdict, many school and local officials in the South defied it. In one major example, Governor Orval Faubus of Arkansas called out the state National Guard to prevent black students from attending high school in Little Rock in 1957. After a tense standoff, President Eisenhower deployed federal troops, and nine students—known as the \"Little Rock Nine\"—were able to enter Central High School under armed guard. ## IMPACT OF BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION Though the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board didn't achieve school desegregation on its own, the ruling (and the steadfast resistance to it across the South) fueled the nascent civil rights movement in the United States. In 1955, a year after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus. Her arrest sparked the Montgomery bus boycott and would lead to other boycotts, sit-ins and demonstrations (many of them led by Martin Luther King Jr.), in a movement that would eventually lead to the toppling of Jim Crow laws across the South. Passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, backed by enforcement by the Justice Department, began the process of desegregation in earnest. This landmark piece of civil rights legislation was followed by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. In 1976, the Supreme Court issued another landmark decision in Runyon v. McCrary, ruling that even private, nonsectarian schools that denied admission to students on the basis of race violated federal civil rights laws. By overturning the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, the Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education had set the legal precedent that would be used to overturn laws enforcing segregation in other public facilities. But despite its undoubted impact, the historic verdict fell short of achieving its primary mission of integrating the nation's public schools. Today, more than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education, the debate continues over how to combat racial inequalities in the nation's school system, largely based on residential patterns and differences in resources between schools in wealthier and economically disadvantaged districts across the country. ## Sources History – Brown v.

The children were orphans, abandoned children or \"children of sin\" - born out of wedlock - and living in sanctuaries. The diagnoses were made quickly and for fiscal reasons. Federal subsidies provided more funding to hospitals than to orphanages. As adults, they called themselves the Duplessis orphans, and demanded compensation, alleging that they had been wrongfully diagnosed, arbitrarily confined to psychiatric facilities, abused - sexually and physically - and subjected to lobotomies, electroshock and straitjackets. As a group, the estimated 2000-3000 Duplessis orphans entered the public arena in 1992, united as the Duplessis Orphan's Committee (Comité des orphelins de Duplessis) and led by writer Bruno Roy. They accused religious communities, the government and the medical profession of forcing them to submit to prolonged institutionalization for essentially financial, not medical, purposes. The matter quickly found itself before the courts, but the orphans suffered failed attempts at appeal and dismissed criminal charges. However, with the tabling of a favourable report by the Quebec Ombudsman in January 1997, the debate became more political. The orphans demanded official apologies from the 3 main groups implicated as well as personal compensation. The Bouchard government waited until 4 March 1999 to apologize and offered the group only $3 million with no individual compensation. The group rejected the offer and continued to wait for apologies from the Catholic Church and the Quebec College of Physicians. In September 1999, Québec bishops rejected the demand for an apology and dismissed any idea of payment. Deadlocked, in the spring of 2000 after a public poll, the movement in favour of the orphans won support from a committee comprising members of the church who had been criticized for adopting the bishops' attitude and some Parti Québécois delegates, among them former senator Jacques Hébert and former health minister Denis Lazure, who presided over the fight. Under Premier Bernard Landry's government, on 30 June 2001 the Duplessis Orphan's Committee accepted an apology and \"fault-free\" individual compensation in the form of a lump sum of $10 000 and an additional $1000 for each year spent in an asylum, roughly $25 000 per person for the 1500 people qualified for compensation. The group initially countered the government's offer with a counter-offer of $50 000 per person, which was refused. When the settlement was reached, the orphans agreed to drop any further legal action against the church. On 21 December 2006 the Quebec government announced it would pay a further $26 million in compensation to the Duplessis orphans. They were required to sign a waiver declaring they would not take legal action against the Catholic Church in order to receive payment. The Church did not apologize, although on 22 November 2007, Marc Cardinal Ouellet, the Catholic Church's top bishop in Québec, issued a sweeping apology for historical wrongs committed by the clergy in an attempt to attract Québecers back to Catholicism. The apology made no mention of the Duplessis orphans, prompting a spokesperson for the group to suggest that the apology lacked credibility. Educators: Take our survey for a chance to win prizes!

They've Got It Covered - MTV  AUTHOR: Archive-Joe-DAngelo  PUBLISHED DATETIME: 2004-10-19 14:49 # A Perfect Circle Album Preview: Politics? They've Got It Covered Band puts its own spin on other songwriters' protests with eMOTIVe. archive-Joe-DAngelo In light of the current political climate, A Perfect Circle's Maynard James Keenan couldn't keep to himself any longer. But instead of expressing his outrage by writing a new album, the famously reclusive singer opted to put his stamp on other songwriters' sentiments. Ten of the 12 songs on APC's third album, eMOTIVe, are covers, and they range from recognizable to relatively obscure. The familiarity that resonates in John Lennon's \"Imagine,\" Nick Lowe's \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding,\" and Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" allows the listener to forgo concentrating too hard on the lyrics. Instead, the words they already know by heart take on updated meanings when juxtaposed with new, and oftentimes harrowing, backdrops. \"Imagine,\" which serves as the album's first single, is hardly the delicate, happy-faced ode to utopia the former Beatle envisioned in 1971. Instead, eerie piano chords plod along dirgelike until a stark violin is abruptly introduced to emphasize the desperation inherent in having hope whittled down to its last thread. \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding,\" an angry pop-punk rave-up as performed most popularly by Elvis Costello, instead comes across as a helpless plea thanks to guitarist Billy Howerdel's high-pitched delivery. \"What's Going On,\" which features layered synths and an angelic Keenan-Howerdel harmony, is another pleading call for help that seems to be sung from a disembodied, third-person standpoint instead of the vital wake-up call that was Gaye's original. Soaring, whining rock guitars, offset by a low-end fuzz, provide anthemic lift to Devo's \"Freedom of Choice,\" which comes off as a pro-vote rally cry. Tolerance is preached through Depeche Mode's \"People Are People,\" where the teetering sound of an alarm stresses its urgency. Black Flag's \"Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie\" tackles the topic of greed from the standpoint of an insatiable beast that doesn't know why it wants more, it just does. And should anyone or anything stand in its way ... we have bombs for that. \"Let's Have a War,\" a 1982 Fear song, seemingly takes a cynical view of the Iraq conflict. \"Let's have a war/ So you can go and die/ ... We can all use the money,\" Keenan deadpans above a skittering techno beat. And in \"When the Levee Breaks,\" Led Zeppelin's famous cover of a Memphis Minnie blues song, a soft, piano-and-bass entwinement renders Keenan's ethereal vocals nearly indecipherable, save for the chorus: \"When the levee breaks, you'll have no place to hide.\" It comes off less as a threat than an omen. Prefacing it all is a whispered recitation of \"Annihilation\" by early '80s punk band Crucifix, setting the tone for what follows with frightening effect: \"Reject the system dictating the norms/ From dehumanization to arms production to hasten this nation towards its destruction,\" Keenan says in a hushed tone. \"It's your choice: peace or annihilation.\" The two new songs on eMOTIVe, \"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\" and \"Passive,\" both extol the dangers of complacency. Where the former is an a industrial-rock march backed by an ominous bass line sung from the standpoint of a heartless dictator; in the latter Keenan expresses his angry disappointment at those who sit idly by and let the bad guys win. eMOTIVe hits stores on Election Day, November 2.

Figure 1: 3 in 5 Canadians said they felt they had very good or excellent. Footnote 1 Perceived health is a subjective measure of how people feel about their health and can be a good reflection of actual health. Footnote 2-4 Health means not only the absence of disease or injury but also physical, mental and social well-being. Footnote 1 #### Over time The proportion of Canadians reporting that they felt they had very good or excellent health has not changed. Footnote 1 58% in 2003. 59% in 2014. #### By income In 2014, Canadians in the lowest household incomes were less likely to report feeling they had very good or excellent health than those living in the highest income households (see Figure 2)Footnote 5. Figure 2: Perception of very good or excellent health by household income, 2014Footnote 5 Deciles (D) are calculated by dividing the Canadian population into ten groups of equal size (deciles) based on household income. Text Equivalent Bar chart showing percent of the population who report being in very good or excellent health by household income in 2014. These data are divided into income deciles. Deciles are calculated by dividing the Canadian population into ten groups of equal size (deciles) based on neighbourhood income.

Data presented above represent very good or excellent perceived health. These data can be reported over time, by income and by sex. The data below for Canada represent good, very good and excellent health (they include all positive responses) in order to allow for the comparison of perceived health among G7 countries. Footnote 8 At 88%, Canada and the United States had the highest proportion of people among G7 countries in 2014 who said that they felt they had good or very good health (see Figure 3)Footnote 8.

LoadingBy Jesse SchedeenUpdated: 23 Apr 2019 4:13 amPosted: 14 Apr 2019 10:21 pmStar Wars Celebration closed out the weekend with one more major panel, as director Dave Filoni and numerous members of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars cast took the stage to tease the animated series' upcoming seventh and final season. Filoni revealed that Clone Wars will go out on one of its most ambitious story arcs yet, as Darth Maul and Ahsoka Tano return in a conflict known as the Siege of Mandalore. It appears that Season 7's 12 episodes will be divided among three major storylines. The first will focus on an elite Clonetrooper squadron called \"Bad Batch.\" These clones have genetic abnormalities that give them more distinct personalities and appearances, as ell as making them even more deadly on the field of battle. The four episodes comprising the \"Bad Batch\" story arc were actually released in rough, unfinished form on the official Star Wars website back in 2015, but Filoni noted that the animation has been significantly improved since then.64 Clone Wars Season 7 Images From Star Wars CelebrationThe remainder of the season looks to revolve heavily around Ahsoka, who was last seen in the Season 5 finale parting ways with her master and the Jedi Order. Filoni and actress Ashley Eckstein emphasized that Season 7 will help bridge the gap between earlier Clone Wars seasons and Ahsoka's later appearances in Star Wars Rebels.\"We see her in Rebels and she's come so far. But we have to go back to that place where she's kind of lost,\" said Eckstein. She also revealed that she had a difficult time getting back into the voice and mindset of this younger Ahsoka after spending so long perfecting the older, Rebels-era version. The second Season 7 story arc will focus on the fugitive Ahsoka as she returns to the bowels of Coruscant and meets two sisters named Trace and Araba. At east some of this storyline will take place on the fabled Level 1313, which was to have been the setting of the canceled video game Star Wars 1313.Finally , the series will wrap up with the massive Siege of Mandalore storyline. Based on the footage screened at the panel, Ahsoka will be temporarily reuniting with Anakin to take part in the Republic's efforts to liberate Mandalore. We even see Captain Rex and his troops decorating their armor in orange paint as tribute to their former commander. LoadingThese final episodes will bring back fan-favorites Darth Maul and Bo Katan, with both Sam Witwer and Katee Sackhoff reprising their respective roles. The Season 7 trailer teases a major showdown between Ahsoka and Maul, the latter of whom is bemused not to be facing off against Obi-Wan Kenobi. Filoni also showed off new concept art for Maul, showing him wearing a costume reminiscent of the one seen in Solo: A Star Wars Story. Filoni revealed that these episodes will feature some of the most elaborate lightsaber sequences in the series' already impressive history. In fact, Filoni brought in actor Ray Park to perform motion capture for the lightsaber battles. That makes Clone wars the second time Park and Witwer have joined forces to bring Maul to life after Solo: A Star Wars Story.

So, it is with much respect that I say congratulations! \"I also had the nice surprise of hearing that they called to invite me to the pre-ceremony party the night before, and then to the actual ceremony. Unfortunately, as you all know, I will be winding down our European tour with JUDAS PRIEST, so I will be unable to attend. However, I'd like to say to Lars (Ulrich) and James (Hetfield), I am so very proud of all you have accomplished. I will continue to pray for the very best for you and your families, as I always have. \"Thank you for the invitation and thinking of me.\" MEGADETH's \"Priest Feast\" European tour with JUDAS PRIEST and TESTAMENT is scheduled to wrap on March 23 in Amsterdam, Holland. METALLICA will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame during an April 4 ceremony at Cleveland's Public Hall. In a late 2008 interview with Rolling Stone magazine about the band's nomination for induction, Hetfield was asked who will be onstage with METALLICA when they get inducted. \"Everyone that played on a record should be there,\" he said. \"You're considered for the Hall 25 years after your first recording, not after you formed.\" After being told that this would omit Dave Mustaine, Hetfield replied, \"He wasn't on a record. Jason Newsted [former METALLICA bassist] should be up there — he was in the band for 14 years and played on quite a few records. And so should Robert [Trujillo; current METALLICA bassist].\" Asked if it will be weird to be there with Jason, Hetfield said, \"There's no reason for it to be weird. We don't want to be part of the soap opera of the Hall of Fame. Everybody wants a train wreck, like with BLONDIE onstage arguing over crap [in 2006]. That really cheapens the moment.\" ### COMMENTS To comment on a story or review, you must be logged in to an active personal account on Facebook. Once you're logged in, you will be able to comment.

Photo: David Buchan/Variety/REX/Shutterstock You didn't need to be a fancy mathematician to realize the shocking extent of Michelle Williams's and Mark Wahlberg's pay gap for All the Money in the World, which came to light last year when the two were in the midst of reshoots for the film. Wahlberg was paid $1.5 million to return to set for about a week-and-a-half, while Williams received a paltry $80 per diem in comparison. (Not to mention, Wahlberg was already paid eight times more than Williams to begin with, despite their equal billing.) Wahlberg ultimately donated the entirety of the sum to Time's Up and Williams expressed gratitude at the time, but the actress is now admitting that the controversy surrounding the pay gap became a defining moment in her life, saying she was \"paralyzed in feelings of futility\" when the news broke. \"Guess what, no one cared,\" Williams said during a speech in Washington, D.C., yesterday. \"This came as no surprise to me, it simply reinforced my life-learned belief that equality is not an inalienable right and that women would always be working just as hard for less money while shouldering more responsibility at home. I've been a working actress since the age of 12. I've been accredited by my industry at the highest levels and that still didn't translate to equal compensation.\" It was only when her good pal Jessica Chastain tweeted about the issue, Williams recalled, that she started to see any significant action begin to take shape. \"Jessica's audience was much wider than mine, and she wasn't afraid to pick up a megaphone and be heard. And heard she was,\" Williams added. \"There was an uproar and a public shaming within my industry that resulted in a $2 million donation to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund.\" (WME, the talent agency that represents both Wahlberg and Williams, also donated $500,000.) As for if the scandal affected the way she chooses future projects, Williams is already seeing conscious, behind-the-scenes action: \"On the job I just completed two weeks ago. Let me tell you something, I was paid equally with my male co-star.\" Major jazz hands to that. ## Related Michelle Williams Is Ready to Lead ## Tags: michelle williams pay gaps all the money in the world mark wahlberg Comments Leave a Comment Michelle Williams Felt 'Paralyzed' During Pay-Gap Scandal ## Most Viewed Stories The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Recap: Hats Off This Is Us Season Finale Recap: Back to the Future What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO New on Netflix: April 2019 Oklahoma Was Never Really O.K. 37 Culture Creators Predict What Will Happen on Game of Thrones ## Most Viewed Stories The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Recap: Hats Off This Is Us Season Finale Recap: Back to the Future What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO New on Netflix: April 2019 Oklahoma Was Never Really O.K. 37 Culture Creators Predict What Will Happen on Game of Thrones ## Promoted links by Taboola ## The Latest the law 21 mins ago Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin Made a Court Appearance in Boston Today But William H.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Workshops are low-cost or free-of-charge and include art-making and music lessons, such as Afro-Puerto Rican drum classes offered by Jose \"Dr. Drum\" Ortiz.", "reference_documents": ["TITLE: Former Home for the Rich Now Gives Life to Struggling Artists | Past Due # Former Home for the Rich Now Gives Life to Struggling Artists By Devin Holt One subway stop uptown from Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, a tall black metal fence surrounds the block-long courtyard of a grand four-story mansion built in the Italian Renaissance palazzo style. But the thick bars and heavy gate around the Andrew Freedman Home don't keep the neighborhood out —far from it. \"Andrew Freedman really is a gift to all of us,\" said Melissa Calderon, Bronx native and residency coordinator for the home. \"It's the only place on the Concourse with a yard.\" The Andrew Freedman Home was built in 1922 as a residence for formerly wealthy senior citizens who had lost their fortunes. The building, declared a New York City Landmark in June 1992, sits at the north end of the most-recently designated historic district in the Bronx, the Grand Concourse Historic District. In recent years, the Andrew Freedman Home has become an important community hub for artists and activists in the south and mid Bronx. An artist in residency program provides studio space for several artists priced out of other neighborhoods in the borough. City-funded? \"It's almost like the exiles of Mott Haven,\" Calderon, 41, said. Artists receive free studio space in exchange for 20 hours of community service each month. Most of them teach classes in the Saturday art program for kids — which costs $20 for three months — or help run the home's theater and interactive art shows. DJ Kool Herc, credited as the originator of hip-hop, and Lisa Kahane, a longtime Bronx photographer, both have a space, and the influential rapper KRS One is expected to take a studio this year. Jose Ortiz, who goes by \"Dr. Drum,\" holds a free Afro-Puerto Rican drum workshop on Mondays and Wednesdays. Ortiz, 57, said his drums had been stuffed in a storage unit for 12 years when he was offered a studio. \"They opened the doors to me, and for once, my drums are out in the open,\" Ortiz said. \"This has been a Renaissance, an awakening, for me just to be able to come here and play the drums.\" The studios are on the second floor, which had been locked up and vacant since the 90s when the program started, and have large windows with 20-foot high ceilings. They line both sides of a long hallway covered in flyers and paintings with a faded, torn green carpet on the floor. An elevator lurched violently when it carried Calderon up from the basement. \"She has her own way of doing things,\" Calderon said, as she grabbed the elevator wall. Calderon said she was part of the Mott Haven art scene for about 10 years and then was priced out when the neighborhood was discovered by real estate investors. She credited the Freedman Home's current director, Walter Puryear, with keeping this small corner of the Bronx art scene alive. \"He saved us,\" Calderon said. \"I couldn't afford a studio, I couldn't afford rent.\" Andrew Freedman — the man — was a New York businessman who was close with leaders of Tammany Hall, once owned the New York Giants and helped finance the city's first subway line. Freedman was convinced that poverty was hardest on people who used to have money. When he died, in 1915, he left most of his estate to a fund that established a home where the fallen gentry could live in style. The Andrew Freedman Home was designed by Joseph H. Freedlander and Harry Allan Jacobs, star architects at the time, and served its original purpose for six decades. The Mid Bronx Senior Citizens Council bought the building in 1983, and that's how Puryear discovered it. His mother worked with the council. Puryear, 44, said she brought him to the home for the first time when he was 6 or 7, and he's felt a special connection to the mansion ever since. \"I feel a sense of responsibility that the grandiosity of the building connects to the neighborhood,\" Puryear said. \"I think it allows people in the Bronx to express a higher quality of themselves.\" Calderon said she shares Puryear's sense of responsibility. The Bronx housing court sits directly across the street from the home, and Calderon said there is usually a line of people waiting to get in when she comes out of the subway. The court building is tall enough that Calderon can see it from the window in her studio. The view serves as a constant reminder of the struggles that working- class artists, and people, face. \"Every time I work that building is hanging over me,\" Calderon said. \"The Bronx is the last place, it truly is. It's the last real place of affordability and is no longer affordable.\""], "label": "S", "category": "Wice", "additional_info": ""}

By Patrick D. McDermott Photographer Harry Gould Harvey IV August 11, 2015 Four years before DIIV played its first show, Zachary Cole Smith moved into an apartment with a girl he barely knew. They shared a bedroom in Brownsville, a mostly un-gentrified Brooklyn neighborhood that's generally regarded as one of the borough's more dangerous areas. When their relationship crumbled a few months into the lease, Smith hopped in his Ford pickup truck and started driving. \"I didn't even know where I was going,\" he tells me. \"As soon as I went through the Holland Tunnel, I was like, Wow, I'm gone.\" Smith crossed America slowly, crashing with friends in cities where he had them and sleeping underneath his truck bed where he didn't. After a misguided attempt to visit his ex-girlfriend in San Diego, he had the idea of reconnecting with his long-estranged father, who was working in a music studio in San Francisco at the time. \"All of a sudden, I was living in his house,\" Smith says. \"I asked him, 'Hey, is there a job in your studio I could do?' He was like, 'Yeah, you can paint it.' After a week, I was like, 'Fuck this.'\" Desperate for cash, Smith found a girl in San Francisco willing to pay $1000 if he drove her things—packed suitcases, a moped, and a \"fuckload\" of weed—to the East Coast. So, roughly six months after first setting out, Smith loaded up his car and headed back to where he started. \"I drove from San Francisco to New York in five days,\" he remembers. \"I just wanted to get the fuck home.\" ### Read Next: DIIV announce new album, share first song \"Skin Game\" Smith was born in New York, and no matter where on earth his urges take him, the city always lures him back. We're sitting at a window table inside one of Greenpoint's traditional Polish bakeries, sipping pink sodas. It's nearly sundown, and the modest eatery feels peaceful in the soft light of dusk. Looking across the table at Smith, who's gone by \"Cole\" since birth, you'd never know that we're only a couple days from full-blown Brooklyn summer: the small-framed 30-year-old has layered two drastically oversized shirts—one tee, one tunic—atop some ragged beige trousers with gaping knee holes, his shoulder-length yellow hair stuffed under a tan Polo cap. It's more or less his signature look, midway between a Seattle grunge rocker and a scrawny schoolboy playing dress up in his father's clothes. Half a block away, a freelance audio engineer named Kurt Feldman is working on Is the Is Are, the long-time-coming sophomore release by Smith's rock band DIIV, which formed in 2011. Almost as if to make up for lost time, the new album will spread 18 songs over two discs. Smith says he's shooting for a 75-minute runtime, just like his favorite double LPs: Fleetwood Mac's Tusk and Can's Tago Mago. Since it's due to be mastered in two weeks, Feldman has been tasked with some last-minute damage control after the primary mixing sessions left some uncomfortably loud tape hiss in the mix. The album isn't the only deadline looming. An occasional model for Saint Laurent, Smith is headed to Paris in less than a week to walk the runway at the legendary fashion brand's latest menswear show. Before that, he's flying to California to visit his beloved girlfriend of two-and-a-half years, the singer, model, and actress Sky Ferreira, who's currently hard at work on her own new record, which Smith says is \"just fucking mind-blowing.\" The couple is also in the early stages of finding a new apartment in New York. On top of it all, tomorrow he's getting kicked out of the two-bedroom home-away-from-home he's been renting for almost two years—but rarely visits—in Catskill, a sleepy town a couple hours north of New York. It might be for the best, though, since Catskill seems to be a reminder of stuff in Smith's life that he'd rather forget. On September 13th, 2013—the night before DIIV was scheduled to perform at Basilica Soundscape, a three-day music festival held inside a renovated 19th century factory in Hudson, New York—Smith's unregistered Ford pickup truck was pulled over in the nearby town of Saugerties. Smith had heroin on him, and Ferreira reportedly had ecstasy—although her charges were later dropped entirely. After Ferreira made bail, she spent several traumatic hours waiting for Smith, completely alone inside the sparsely furnished one-floor Catskill house without food, heat, or internet. After that weekend, she never wanted to go back. Watching the couple's hollow-eyed mugshots make the rounds on nearly every major music site was taxing for Smith, but he seems to feel the worst about landing his then-21-year-old girlfriend behind bars; he says Ferreira didn't even know he was still using at the time. \"Everyone thought she was a junkie,\" he remembers of the media shitstorm that followed. The arrest isn't the only hiccup that has haunted DIIV in the three years since Oshin, the critically acclaimed debut album that perched the band precariously on the brink of big-time success. According to Smith, DIIV's original drummer Colby Hewitt is no longer in the band as of this spring, due to an alleged struggle with multiple drug addictions, and bassist Devin Ruben Perez spent the end of 2014 shrouded in controversy after making a host of gross comments on 4Chan. Is the Is Are could be a real moment of redemption for Smith, the frontman of a truly polarizing band that's spent the past few years making headlines for everything other than its music. Smith, for his part, says he's trying his hardest to stay clean. \"I feel like I owe the world a good record,\" he tells me. \"I was blessed enough to get this far; it would be such a shame to sputter out now.\" Devin Ruben Perez and Andrew Bailey Smith's pre-DIIV past has some dark patches too. Though he was born in the city, he grew up in suburban Connecticut with his mom, a one-time Vogue editor he describes as \"one of his very best friends,\" and his younger sister. His father, a musician also named Zachary, moved the family to the suburbs not long before he up and left for good; Smith was four, and his sister was just a baby. \"I don't care what actually happened at this point,\" Smith says, \"because no matter what, I don't think he did much to remedy it. I saw it as like, 'Oh, I have a dad one minute, and the next I'm like, Where is my dad? What happened?'\" When Smith was a freshman in high school, he and a friend went out looking for smokes and ended up smashing a bunch of truck windows with rocks in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart. Both boys were arrested, and Smith was expelled from school. \"I was completely running wild,\" he remembers, noting that it was during this period that he began experimenting with drugs and alcohol. \"I was the first kid to show up [to school] with weed,\" he recalls. A couple years later, one of his close friends from this stretch would die from an overdose. When he tells me this, it's like he's remembering it for the first time in a long time. \"I feel like in some bizarre world, that could have been me,\" he says. After his stepdad borrowed money to enroll him in private school, an unruly-as-ever Smith pinballed from prep school to prep school, first meeting DIIV guitarist Andrew Bailey at one of them. \"Cole looked like your stereotypical nerd,\" Bailey will tell me later, recalling one of their earliest interactions. \"He had thick-framed glasses. He dressed kind of like Rivers Cuomo meets a British punk. And he looked really young. This one kid started picking on him, and he was just like, 'Shut the fuck up you motherfucking cocksucker! I'm going to go smoke cigarettes.' Everyone's jaw dropped, like, 'Woah, what is that person?\" It's a story that hints at the loose-cannon quality that would make Smith such a magnetic frontman over a decade later. After high school, Smith spent a year and change at Hampshire, an experimentally minded liberal arts college in Western Massachusetts. A couple days after finding out he wasn't going to be invited back for his sophomore spring semester, Smith met a girl named Jenny at a New Year's Eve party in New York. By January 1st, 2007, he was living in her Brownsville bedroom. Not long after his impulsive cross-country trek, Smith landed a job at Angelica Kitchen, a cozy East Village restaurant that's been serving tasty vegan food to artists and hippies since the '70s. Through work, he started connecting with New York's thriving underground music scene: if hungry musicians came in looking for free food, Smith would share what he could. While he'd played guitar since he was a small child, even starting a half-assed band with Bailey and another friend in high school, he says he'd always considered it more of a hobby than a calling: \"It was just something I knew how to do.\" It wasn't until 2010, after a couple years playing in the local psych rock band Soft Black and the well-liked jangle-pop outfit Beach Fossils, that Smith, then 26, decided to start writing his own rock songs. At first, Smith says his biggest goal was getting signed to Beach Fossils' record label, Captured Tracks, a tastemaking Brooklyn indie. After recording a couple tracks himself, Smith enlisted his old friend Bailey, now a tall and lanky guitarist; former Smith Westerns drummer Colby Hewitt; and bassist Devin Ruben Perez, a long-haired, chicken-legged, once-homeless New York scenester who'd never played in a band before. They were called Dive back then, before Smith changed the spelling \"out of respect\" for an early '90s industrial band from Belgium. In October of 2011, Smith signed a deal with Captured Tracks. \"Cole had a plan, and we were part of the plan,\" label founder Mike Sniper tells me over the phone. By that time, DIIV had already started gigging relentlessly all over New York, sometimes playing two shows on the same night. Their dark, drugged-up songs had a lot in common with the internet-generation slacker rock that had been flooding the city's underground for the past few years, an era marked by cassette-quality production, time-warped guitar tones, and hazy vocals. But something about DIIV's textured songcraft—the tangled-up riffs, the motorik grooves, and the mind-numbing repetition—made that lo-fi rock formula seem sorta new again. Their music felt like sped-up shoegaze for late-night weirdos, and the band performed it with a gripping, nothing-else-matters punk energy. \"Part of it was who we were, who we knew, and what we looked like,\" Smith remembers of their early reception, which may have been at least partly influenced by their too-cool, ragamuffin charms. \"But it also had to do with the songs, and how much we were willing to play.\" \"I feel like I owe the world a good record. I was blessed enough to get this far; it would be such a shame to sputter out now.\" For a while, it was almost like DIIV was the unofficial house band of 285 Kent, a wide-open waterfront warehouse known for its all-over-the-place lineups and unhinged parties that were, according to Smith, \"legendary to anybody who was ever there.\" The music video for Oshin single \"Doused,\" a song about his complicated relationship with his father—It stops and starts/ A gesture here and there...you blew it/ Now you've gone too far—features the bandleader full-on sprinting through the moonlit streets of Brooklyn, hurrying to join the rest of the band thrashing around on the venue's stage. Today, 285's unmarked door has been shut for more than a year, and its neighboring DIY havens, Glasslands and Death By Audio, are closed too. (The building in which all three were located is now being rented by Vice.) By the time Oshin came out, in June of 2012, DIIV had a booking agent and didn't really need to play as many shows around town. With all the hype surrounding his project, Smith says he started feeling alienated from his peers in the scene. \"I walked into 285 Kent the day [the record] came out, and all these people are like, 'Hey man, congrats on Pitchfork. Best New Music!' I felt like they thought I was better than them, or that they thought I had a big head. Like, 'Why you?' I never really felt like a true part of [the community] after that.\" Today, the version of Brooklyn that DIIV outgrew doesn't really exist anymore—at least not in Williamsburg. A few days after our first meeting, when I ask Smith to suggest a place to grab a drink, he arbitrarily chooses a yuppie-friendly bar called Black Bear, not realizing that it was constructed on the site of Public Assembly, a venue DIIV used to play before it closed, near the end of 2013. He may have picked it because it was a quick walk from his and Ferreira's apartment. More than likely, though, he just doesn't know where to go anymore. The next morning, on a sterile North Williamsburg block about half a mile from the old 285 Kent, Smith answers the door in only a beach towel. He dashes around the two-floor apartment with the energy of a kid before a field trip, his wet hair pulled into a messy high ponytail. Since he and Ferreira are moving soon, the place is a total wreck: the couch is hidden beneath piles of seemingly clean clothes, and there's an empty, sad-looking fish tank that dried up after Smith left it in the care of a flaky housesitter. The lower level is just as cluttered, with racks upon racks of Ferreira's chic clothing, plus a bare twin mattress and a flatscreen TV that doesn't work. \"Sky would kill me if she knew I let you in here,\" Smith says. After Bailey arrives, we cross the street to the parking lot where the DIIV van has been sitting dormant since the end of last year, when the band put touring on hold to concentrate on writing and recording the new LP. Smith says he had to pay $1700 in overdue fees to even be able to take it out. It's a little after 10AM, and the three of us are making the two-hour drive to Catskill to collect the last of Smith's stuff from his house up there. While waiting for the van's tires to fill up with air, Smith and Bailey play tic-tac-toe on the dust-covered window. On the road, the pair chat about writing Is the Is Are in January and February of this year, when Smith rented a warehouse and flew the whole band to L.A. to help him expand on the demos he had written alone. They're candid about the difficulties of collaborating with recently departed drummer Hewitt, who Smith says is a \"hardcore fucking drug addict\" and had trouble learning the new songs. (Via email, Hewitt denied drug use as the reason for his departure, citing instead a lack of steady income from the band and creative frustrations. \"I quit because I never really liked the music that much,\" he explained.) On DIIV's recent European tour, Oshin session drummer Ben Newman filled in. It's bright out, and Bailey is driving carefully on a winding, two-lane country highway with a jagged rock face running along its right shoulder. \"Colby just needs to figure his shit out,\" Smith says from the passenger seat. \"When I had my shit, I figured it out,\" Bailey adds, hinting at his own trip to a Georgia rehab facility, in 2013, after trying to quit drinking cold turkey sent him into a life-threatening withdrawal. \"This road freaks me out,\" Smith says suddenly. \"It's, like, falling apart.\" \"There's a lot of people around me who were doing really badly, and there were a lot of people around me doing well. And I knew which one I wanted to be.\" If you ask, Smith will tell you about getting high. He'll tell you that when tripping in groups, he prefers to drop the LSD a few minutes before everyone else so that he can be \"the leader,\" and he'll tell you about a time he spent staring mindlessly at a wall for 12 hours straight after trying meth in Los Angeles. He'll relay nerve-racking anecdotes about shooting up cocaine and cushioning the comedown with heroin, a sensation he likens to getting struck by a freight train and crash-landing in a pillow factory. \"There's an expression I always think about,\" he says: \"A smart man learns from his own mistakes; a wise man learns from others' mistakes. I've been able to apply that to my life in a lot of ways, but when it comes to drugs, I can't be told, 'Don't do it.' I have to try everything for myself. I couldn't live my life knowing that there was this insane experience that I was missing out on.\" When he started DIIV, Smith says he found himself surrounded by a lot of people using drugs, including smack. \"It was, like, everyone,\" he says of the particular clique of New York creative types he'd fallen into. Soon enough, he was using too. By 2013, Smith's growing addiction to heroin started to become a serious problem. At the peak of DIIV's popularity, a strung-out Smith couldn't give fans what they wanted most: new music. \"When I was getting fucked up all the time, I wrote literally zero songs,\" Smith remembers. He tried to pull it together, but even a single day without heroin can hurl an addict into a head-spinning, stomach-turning dope sickness. In the summer of 2013, an entire recording session with ex-Girls bassist and producer Chet \"JR\" White was scrapped. \"Quitting gets put off,\" Smith says, \"because there's never a good time to feel like fucking hell.\" After the arrest upstate, Smith was formally charged with a criminal misdemeanor for drug possession. In January of 2014, he left New York for an upscale detox facility in southern Connecticut that once treated the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. The court-ordered detox was brutal; Smith says the highest available dose of Methadone—a synthetic opiate given to help ease the pain of withdrawal—paled in comparison to the amount of smack he had been injecting every day. \"I think the longest opiate person they ever had stayed for seven days,\" Smith says. \"I was there for eleven.\" To get through it, he re- read journalist Michael Azerrad's Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana, a nonfiction book originally published a year before Kurt Cobain's death. \"It made me feel like I was back on the road with my band,\" Smith says. \"It made me feel like there was a world out there.\" After he was discharged, he says the possibility of losing Ferreira did more to keep him straight than any recovery program. \"Sky was extremely adamant that I couldn't be using drugs and be in a relationship with her at the same time,\" Smith says. \"Given that choice, it's pretty fucking obvious which direction to go in.\" Smith tells me he's clean now, or heroin-free at least (on more than one occasion, we drink together). It's obvious he's excited about his sprawling new double-LP, animatedly introducing each track as he plays it in the van on the way to Catskill: \"This is my favorite song!\" he says. \"No, this one!\" He only sings along once, when we listen to a moody number featuring Ferreira speak-singing some abstract poetry. Musically, Is the Is Are is both a continuation of Oshin's songcraft and an introduction to a sharper and more labored-over DIIV sound. Some new tracks sound angry—like \"Dust,\" a seismic standout that has been in the band's live set for almost two years. And some sound pensive, such as a pretty song Smith's been calling \"Healthy Moon,\" which opens with the lazily sung lyric: How can I describe this fading dream? It's a simple sentiment, but one that seems to precisely explain the half-cognitive euphoria DIIV's music captures, a fearless high that's always on the verge of slipping away. It doesn't take long to work out that a lot of the songs are about wrestling with addiction: on one, Smith sings the Alcoholic Anonymous catchphrase, It works if you work it, and another goes, I was high but now I feel low. On Oshin, the vocalizations were muddled in the mix, just another gear in Smith's delirium-inducing machine. \"This time,\" he says, \"I really wanted people to be able to understand the words and connect with them.\" These songs are more observational and more confessional, influenced by his personal demons and those stalking the people closest to him. \"There's a lot of people around me who were doing really badly, and there were a lot of people around me doing well,\" Smith says. \"And I knew which one I wanted to be.\" \"I hate this fucking place,\" Smith says, jostling the knob on the Catskill house's gray door. We're standing on stepping stones in the house's overgrown garden, which you get to by crossing an actual white picket fence and walking down a lumpy green hill, one street over from the town's storybook Main Street. When we finally get inside, the first thing that catches my eye is an artist badge from the ill-fated 2013 Basilica festival, resting on an ugly brown rug. Somehow, DIIV wound up performing there the day after Smith's arrest, when Basilica founder and legendary Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur bailed him out of jail. There isn't much stuff left to pack up, though almost everything Smith uncovers seems to have some deep-seated sentimental value. Looking through the crates of books, he singles out an odd tome called Shaman that he and Perez found on the street in Brooklyn years ago. Its pages contain some of the band's more recognizable imagery, including the ancient stone carvings Smith screen-printed onto some CD-Rs he burned for early demos of \"Sometime\" and \"Corvalis.\" During a break from loading the van, he gets a text saying that Saint Laurent is looking for last-minute male models to walk in the upcoming show. Bailey strips down to his shorts and pouts against the off-white wall while Smith snaps a few iPhone pics to send to casting. Some of Smith's most prized possessions are also still tucked away in the house, including two guitars. One is an electric that his father gave to him at birth; it's dark blue and has little cowboy-themed drawings on it, supposedly made from children's pajamas found in a ghost town. The second is a beat-up acoustic that used to belong to Elliott Smith, the singer-songwriter who committed suicide at the age of 34. Ferreira got it from composer Jon Brion—a friend of Elliott's who collaborated with Ferreira on her 2012 EP, Ghost—and gifted it to Smith on their first Valentine's Day together. When he finds it, he pulls it out of the case, strums a few clumsy chords, and starts to play \"Alameda,\" a sad song that Elliott Smith released in 1997: Nobody broke your heart/ You broke your own cause you can't finish what you start, he sings. Nobody broke your heart. Elliott Smith is just one of several doomed rock stars the DIIV frontman is obsessed with. He's a big fan of garage punk icon Jay Reatard, who died in his sleep from a mixture of cocaine and alcohol, and he's unabashed about his love for Johnny Thunders, the legendary New York punk guitarist whose seemingly drug-related death at age 39 remains a mystery to this day. And, of course, there's Kurt Cobain, whose name comes up often during our time together, though Smith just calls him \"Kurt.\" In the car earlier, we talked about Montage of Heck, the recently released documentary that stitches together rare home-movie footage of the Nirvana frontman with rotoscope-animated reenactments of his early life. Smith watched it with his mother, who he says felt uncomfortable because she had trouble separating the platinum-blond boy on screen from her own son. In the homemade music video Smith directed for Ferreira's 2013 song \"Omanko,\" there's a shot of the couple in their bathroom mirror. Smith's got the camcorder in one hand, and he leans down to give Ferreira a soft kiss on her face. It's a romantic image but also an eerie one, like footage waiting to be unearthed by a documentary crew a couple decades into the future. Smith seems to feel a kinship with this contingent of gone-too-soon songwriters. But at this particular moment in time, it doesn't really seem like he's looking for his own tragic ending—not now, anyway. There's a beautiful new album on the way and too much to lose, including the unwavering support of Ferreira. \"I've put her through a lot,\" Smith says of his girlfriend. \"She dealt with all of it and continued to love me.\" It's hard to know if the long-delayed Is the Is Are will be a success—and whether a band like DIIV can ever fully bounce back from all the blog-world controversies, addictions, and interpersonal struggles that have riddled its upward trajectory from the start. But though nothing is certain, Smith isn't ready to give up just yet, and it's time once again to go home to New York. Before we leave Catskill, Smith stops at a tiny store on Main Street. \"I got you a present,\" he says when he emerges, tossing me a strawberry-flavored Ring Pop, and keeping another for himself. Bailey carefully steers the van onto the road, dodging a few slow-moving townies ambling around on foot. \"All these upstate towns are totally stuck in time,\" Bailey says as we start the drive back home. For a couple seconds, we can see the little house's red bricks through the trees. Smith puts his slender hand out the open window, the spit-covered candy jewel on his finger glistening in the day's last light. \"Bon voyage, baby,\" he says, waving to no one. ##### Pre -order a copy of DIIV's issue of The FADER now.

Both fighters recently took part in the ill-fated Ultimate Women Challenge reality show competition last year, though results from the fights that took place during filming have yet to be released. The bout between Young and Kedzie will determine the first Jackson's MMA Series Women's Champion. Young (4-4-0)* opened her career with four devastating knockout wins, including a victory over current Strikeforce title challenger Miesha \"Takedown\" Tate, and captured the one-night HOOKnSHOOT title on November 24, 2007. However, she suffered defeats in each of her next four fights, with one loss coming at the hands of Gina \"Conviction\" Carano on a CBS-televised EliteXC card in 2008. Last January, she entered the Freestyle Cage Fighting Women's Grand Prix, but fell victim to a second-round armbar from Jennifer \"Rosebud\" Tate in the quarterfinals. Looking to get her career back on track, Young gave up a fight last September in order to take part in the filming of the Ultimate Women Challenge competition. The show's premise was initially based on the popular series The Ultimate Fighter, but suffered from last-minute changes and fighters were driven in secrecy to Utah for the duration of the competition. As a result of ongoing legal issues involving the show and its producers, the Pete Suazo Utah Athletic Commission has yet to release the results from six sanctioned professional bouts that were contested on September 24th. Kedzie (15-8-0)* carried a two-fight winning streak into filming of the UWC competition in September, and later picked up a big victory over rising prospect Sarah \"The Monster\" D'Alelio at Jackson's MMA Series 3 in December. The seven-year veteran of the sport, who is still just 29 years old, has battled a who's who of MMA throughout her career. Kedzie also holds a HOOKnSHOOT Grand Prix title, as she won three fights in one night on November 19, 2005. She has totalled victories over Molly Helsel (twice), Jan Finney (thrice) and Kelly Kobold, and a win over Young would be one of Kedzie's biggest to date. While all four of Young's victories have come by knockout, Kedzie has never been stopped with strikes in her 23 recorded bouts. Kedzie's highest profile fight also came in a televised battle with Gina Carano, under the EliteXC banner in 2007. She was defeated by Carano via Unanimous Decision, but the bout attracted considerable praise from fans and media alike. Kedzie will now have a chance to capture a championship title in front of many of her Jackson's MMA teammates and supporters. Jackson's MMA Series 4 takes place on April 9th at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Albuqerque, New Mexico. The bout between Young and Kedzie, which MMARising.com confirmed with a source close to the negotiations today, is expected to be formally announced on or before March 8th. It will be contested over five, five-minute rounds at 135 pounds. * Note: Listed records do not include bouts which took place during the filming of the Ultimate Women Challenge reality show on September 24th in St. George, Utah.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Smith died in Blackville, New Brunswick, on 24 January 1957.", "reference_documents": ["TITLE: The first nurse, National Portrait Gallery Skip to main content # The first nurse ## by Tamsin Hong, 24 March 2016 Rev. Victor B. Walls and Mrs. Walls, Trinidad, B.W.I., c.1930 Nowhere in Marion Smith's First World War service records is there any evidence of her country of birth. Yet nestled in the records of the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service Reserve is evidence of possibly the only Australian Aboriginal woman to serve during the First World War. Marion Elizabeth Leane Smith spent her first few years in Liverpool, New South Wales. Her grandmother Lucy Leanne was a Darug woman and is on record for petitioning the NSW Aborigines Protection Board in 1889, where she described herself as 'only surviving native woman of the Georges River and the Liverpool District'. Her daughter Elizabeth was born and raised in Liverpool, where she later married her English cousin George William Smith in 1890. Marion was born the following year. It is not clear what prompted George and Elizabeth Smith to move to Canada with their daughter Marion. However, the turn of the century was textured by growing concerns about the welfare of 'half-caste' children, leading to the devastation of the Stolen Generations. Had the Smiths remained in Australia, Marion's upbringing would have been decidedly different. Following her childhood in Canada, Marion temporarily moved to the United States to train as a nurse at the New England Hospital in Roxbury, Massachusetts. On the other side of the Atlantic, Germany invaded Belgium, refusing Britain's demands to retreat, resulting in Britain declaring war in August 1914. This declaration automatically incorporated Britain's colonies, including Canada. Marion returned to Canada before enlisting with the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service Reserve (QAIMNS) on 7 March, 1917. The QAIMNS was established in 1902 and replaced the Army Nursing Service in Great Britain. At the outbreak of the First World War there were around 300 nurses in the service, and over the course of the war a further 11 000 joined the QAIMNS. These women tended to be over twenty-five years old and single, and were required to be well-educated and of good social standing. Smith was twenty-six years old when she joined, and would have been required to complete a three year training course in a War Office-approved hospital. Smith embarked for France in March 1917 where she joined No. 41 Ambulance Train by the end of the year. The ambulance trains were specially fitted to transport injured troops from casualty clearing stations on the front to base hospitals, and were in operation in France and Belgium. As the trains bumped along, nurses navigated narrow aisles and dim lighting to tend to the casualties. Troops lay in bunks arranged in three tiers on either side of the crowded aisles. Some trains also included surgical theatres for emergency operations. Smith excelled despite the difficult conditions, and the sister in charge of No. 41 Ambulance Train reported that 'Staff Nurse Smith has given complete satisfaction in the carrying out of her duties whilst on this Train; her work is both quickly and efficiently done. She is most capable in every way.' As nurses were employed by contract in the QAIMS, when Smith's expired in September 1918 she requested an extension. She then served in Italy with Britain's Italian Expeditionary Force before moving to the University War Hospital in Southampton, where she remained until after the war ended. In May 1919, Smith sailed home to 'Home Farm' in Fredericton Junction, Canada. She met a clergyman named Victor Benjamin Walls and they married on New Year's Day in 1924 at the Smiths' family home. There is some speculation that Walls and Smith met during the war, as Walls had also served. He had interrupted his studies at Dalhouse University to enlist with the Canadian Medical Corps, with which he served in Britain, France and Belgium. Not long after their wedding, Victor and Marion Walls travelled to Trinidad so Victor could take up his post as principal of Naparima College, where he would remain for almost thirty years. During this time, Marion gave birth to a son and became dedicated to the school's extra-curricular activities. She also wrote the school hymn, which continues to be sung today. Marion was devoted to raising medical awareness in Trinidad. When the Second World War erupted, Marion brought the Red Cross to the country and served as the commandant for the duration of the war. For her work she was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, which is awarded to those who show 'distinguished leadership in action'. Upon Victor's retirement, the Walls returned to Canada and lived in Blackville, New Brunswick. Marion died four years later on 24 January 1957, aged 66. Victor Walls remained in Blackville where he served as a United Church minister briefly from 1972-73, and married Verna E. Augustine from Trinidad.

Five thousand years ago, Egypt became the world's first territorial state with strict borders, organised religion, centralised administration and intensive agriculture. It lasted for millennia and set a template that countries still follow today. Archaeologists have assumed it developed gradually from the pastoral communities that preceded it, but physicist Mike Dee from the University of Oxford and his colleagues now suggest that the transition could have taken as little as 600 years. ##### Advertisement The early history of ancient Egypt is murky because although there are plenty of archaeological finds, including royal tombs, there is no reliable way to attribute firm dates to the various reigns and periods. Radiocarbon dating has previously been of limited use because dating individual objects gives ranges of up to 300 years. To improve on that, Dee and his colleagues used a computerised statistical approach known as Bayesian modelling. They compiled radiocarbon dates from nearly 200 artefacts, including hair, plants and bone, from known reigns or periods during Egypt's First Dynasty and the Predynastic period before it. They entered these into a computer model to estimate the most likely dates of transition between the different periods. It is illegal to remove archaeological samples from Egypt, so the researchers dated items from museum collections in Europe and North America, as well as freshly excavated seed samples from Tell es-Sakan on the Gaza Strip, which was an outpost of ancient Egypt. ## The first king For the First Dynasty, the estimated reign lengths match the human lifespan, which was around 30 to 40 years at the time. This suggests that Egypt was ruled by individual kings right from the start, rather than by clans, as some experts have suggested. The researchers used carbon dating to estimate with 68 per cent probability that the first ruler, King Aha, took to the throne between 3111 and 3045 BC, and died between 3073 and 3036 BC. They also concluded that the Predynastic period began in 3800-3700 BC, so it lasted just 600-700 years, several centuries less than previously thought. \"This is a period during which Egypt goes through a major transition,\" says Dee. It started with small, cattle-owning communities who migrated with the seasons. \"At the end you've got a state.\" \"All the important things that our societies do were invented then,\" says Günter Dreyer who, until recently, was the director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, and has led excavations at Abydos, one of ancient Egypt's oldest cities, for more than 30 years. \"We're still standing on their shoulders.\" He is sceptical about the accuracy of radiocarbon measurements when it comes to absolute dates, but agrees the technique gives a valuable indication of the lengths of different historical periods. During the Predynastic period, progress \"becomes faster and faster, so much happens\", he says. \"In the last two centuries, around 3200 BC, it is breathtaking.\" Dee hopes that archaeologists will now reappraise the period, to start to understand what triggered such dramatic changes.

The series will come completely to Netflix while new episodes will air in Australia weekly. Here's what you need to know. It may seem two minutes ago we got the first season of the Australia political thriller and that's because all six episodes of season 1 dropped on Netflix in June 2018. That's because Netflix picked up the series two years after its first season actually aired in Australia on Foxtel. As we said soon after the release, the second season was due to be released in Australia in early 2019 and that time has now come but what we weren't expecting is how quickly it'd drop on Netflix. Season 2 is currently due out on Netflix around the world (excluding Australia) on March 6th, 2019 as announced via the Netflix page for the show. Secret city season 2 release date on Netflix.com #### Are all episodes releasing at once? Foxtel will be airing episodes weekly in Australia from March 4th but is also taking a Netflix-like approach by releasing all the episodes on its own streaming service on March 4th too. That's how Netflix is able to then get all six episodes of season 2 a couple of days later. #### When will Secret City season 2 be on Netflix in Australia? Don't expect season 2 of Secret City to be on Netflix in Australia until at least the end of 2019. Foxtel really wants you to get a Foxtel Now subscription so that's the best way to stream all the episodes. #### What to expect in season 2 of Secret City The series is now on its own path as it has departed from the original books the show is based on. The series has been filmed once again at Parliament House. Returning for season 2 is \"Danielle Cormack (Wentworth), Don Hany (East West 101), Rob Collins (Cleverman), Andrew McFarlane (The Sullivans), Marcus Graham (Cleverman), Sacha Horler (The Letdown) and Joel Tobeck (Tangle).\" Are you looking forward to the return of Secret City on Netflix?

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were \"resolved\" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations. The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs. This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine, providing a path back to lost websites and work. Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find. The Archive Team Panic Downloads are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

But when news broke that he had decided to put his own spin on Taylor Swift's 1989 (and was interpreting it in the style of the Smiths, no less), it was one of his more random, if not entirely unexpected, gestures. After all, Adams once made a blues version of the Strokes' 2001 debut, Is This It, which never saw the light of day, and he's decidedly un-snobbish about his musical likes. As it turns out, Adams was indeed serious about treating his version of 1989 with complete respect and reverence. The finished product is decidedly free of irony or shtick, and, perhaps more important for a covers album, transforms the source material. Swift's 1989 felt upbeat and empowering, though its lyrics touched on damaging breakups, irresistible bad decisions, and romantic regrets, because she never gave up hope that things might work out in her favor. Adams' interpretation of 1989 is a case of seeing the glass half empty: He operates under the assumption that things are irrevocably damaged, and responds accordingly. And so the \"Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want\"-esque acoustic posturing of \"Out Of The Woods\" exacerbates the song's uncertainty about a relationship's status; the reverb-slathered, minor-key jangle of \"All You Had To Do Was Stay\" is contorted by anguish, not desperation; and the conspiratorial acoustic riffs, string shivers, and falsetto-kissed vocal delivery of \"Blank Space\" are a eulogy to optimism. Even the relentless pep talk \"Shake It Off\" is an unconvincing attempt at breaking out of personal doldrums. This approach to 1989 works so well in part because Adams tends to be at his best when he's wallowing in heartbreak. But it's also successful because he doesn't overstate this interpersonal drama. The 1989 arrangements (and the moody contributions of La Sera guitarist Tod Wisenbaker, who collaborated with Adams on the album) are sparse and restrained, with plenty of space for melancholy to linger and resonate. Watercolor-hued strings and well-placed percussion thumps creep into the acoustic-ruffled \"How You Get The Girl\"; \"Bad Blood\" is the quintessential Adams-style alt-country shuffle; and \"This Love\" becomes a chilling piano ballad. The much-ballyhooed Smiths influence is also rather seamless, especially on the sighing rainy day riffs on \"Wildest Dreams\" and dreampop jam \"I Wish You Would.\" (The flamenco guitar splashes and rattlesnake percussion on \"I Know Places,\" however, firmly resemble modern-day solo Morrissey.) Yet 1989 is more than just a Moz homage. As with 2014's Ryan Adams, there's also a strong Springsteen vibe: \"Shake It Off\" nicks the tick-tock drumming and solemn midnight ambience of \"I'm On Fire,\" while Adams' clenched-teeth vocal delivery and salt-of-the-earth strums on \"Welcome To New York\" are classic Boss signifiers. And another highlight, the raucous \"Style,\" is a yearning, '80s college rock fever dream with snarling punk stabs à la Sonic Youth. In a sense, Adams has created the soundtrack to a fictional '80s teen movie. Still, what his version of 1989 does best is illustrate the strength of the source material. With the radio-ready gloss stripped away, these songs compare to the best moments in Swift's back catalog. For fans, this isn't a new revelation: Despite the sleeker production, Taylor's 1989 themes didn't stray that far from her roots, just reflected the fact that she's matured. Adams will receive a reputation boost and a boatload of new Twitter followers thanks to the support of loyal Swifties, which is completely deserved. But his 1989 is also a stark reminder that Swift's songwriting continues to deserve respect and kudos. ## You may also like #### Mirai Nagasu Just Became the First American Woman to Land a Triple Axel in the Winter Olympics 51 minutes agoThe Grapevine #### World of Wakanda!

Olin D. Johnston, died Saturday. She was 78. \"It is a tremendous loss for Spartanburg County. When you said the name Liz, everyone knew who you were talking about,\" said state Sen. Glenn Reese, D-Spartanburg. Reese said when he was first elected to office he decided to emulate Patterson's approach to public service. She always had a positive attitude and knew how to work with people, he said. Over the past two weeks, Reese said he was working with others to have Patterson awarded the Order of Palmetto, the state's highest civilian honor. \"She did all she could do. Her entire family has contributed to the state, starting with her father on down,\" Reese said. \"Her whole life was about serving others. She was a wonderful representative of South Carolina.\" Patterson served on Spartanburg County Council in the 1970s, followed by a stint in the state Senate until 1986, when she launched a hard-fought but ultimately successful campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives. Patterson, a Democrat, was the first woman to win the 4th Congressional District seat in an area that was already becoming known as a Republican stronghold. It was a groundbreaking accomplishment, said Don Fowler, a Spartanburg native and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \"At the time, the traditions and attitudes toward women in government and public life were more binding than they are now,\" Fowler said. The late Ron Romine, a longtime Democratic activist in Spartanburg who managed Patterson's first congressional campaign, told the Herald-Journal in 2014 that it was a thrill to visit Patterson in Washington after she was sworn in. \"Let me tell you, this woman made a splash. She was known all over D.C.,\" Romine said at the time. \"Having a woman elected from South Carolina to Congress was unheard of.\" Angela Geter, the current chairwoman of the Spartanburg County Democratic Party, said Patterson's contributions can be seen today on the national level. \"I believe the unprecedented amount of women running for Congress and other elected positions is largely because of trailblazers like former U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Patterson,\" Geter said in a statement. \"The state Democratic Party, the county Democratic Party and the citizens of Spartanburg will certainly feel this loss. Our prayers and condolences go out to the Patterson family in this most difficult of times.\" Patterson remained active after leaving politics. She ran the Spartanburg County Democratic Party for years. She taught political science at Spartanburg Methodist College, and she received her master's degree in liberal arts from Converse College in 1999. In 2010, Patterson became the Rotary Club of Spartanburg's first female president. She and her family were active members of Central United Methodist Church. Pat Patterson, the oldest son of Liz Patterson, said his mother died Saturday afternoon and that the family asks for privacy as funeral arrangement are being made. \"At this time we want to thank all of the people in the Upstate,\" Pat Patterson said. Pat Patterson said his mother worked to inspire others after she left public office. South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson said Patterson had a remarkable career and was a politician known for always telling the truth. \"You always knew where she stood on issues,\" he said. \"She was a tremendous trailblazer who was gracious, kind and very intelligent. It's a profound loss.\" Rick Beltram, who was the Spartanburg County Republican Party chairman when Patterson was leading the local Democratic Party, said he and Patterson would go to local high schools during the buildup to the 2004 general election. They debated and discussed the issues with a civil tone. \"We had very vigorous debates,\" Beltram said. \"She was always a very professional person.\" U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, said Patterson had a touch that resonated with the public. He called her a great role model. Clyburn also said Patterson treated everyone she met equally. \"She had common instincts in politics and was a real Southern model of how one should conduct themselves in public life. Today, everybody is so contentious,\" Clyburn said. \"Civility, I think that is her legacy. She was just a very civil person.\" July 2007: Liz Patterson asks presidential candidates how they will improve Head Start and ensure parents are involved in early childhood education. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } A life of service Patterson worked for VISTA and the Peace Corps after graduating from Columbia College in 1961. She saw her parents as role models in life. In politics, she looked up to U.S. Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, a Republican from Maine who served in Congress from 1940 to 1973. Smith was the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress. Fowler said Patterson had a heart for those in lower economic and social classes, working to fight for their needs. She was also known for her advocacy of early childhood education. \"Liz was a special person,\" Fowler said. \"She was the daughter of a governor and U.S. senator, so it gave her the opportunity to learn about public life and how government and politics works.\" Both in her political career and after it, Patterson was known for her willingness to pass that knowledge on. U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, the Republican who currently represents South Carolina's 4th Congressional District, said as a teenager he worked at the Community Cash at Hillcrest Mall and would often ask to bag Patterson's groceries. He said he would ask her questions about politics and was impressed that she would take time to listen to him. \"She had a lifetime of public service and was humble, gracious and always kind in the way she conducted herself,\" Gowdy said. Gowdy said Patterson was able to connect with people because she was likable. \"After she left the U.S. House, she didn't fade from public view,\" Gowdy said. Former state Rep. Brenda Lee Pryce said she was inspired to run for office after watching Patterson's successful career. \"I learned a lot from Liz and cut my teeth in politics under her,\" said Pryce, a Democrat. \"I would say the legacy that she leaves in Spartanburg is that she was a caring person for the downtrodden.\" Patterson lost her re-election bid in a contentious race with a then-33-year-old Bob Inglis in 1992. Nine years later, Inglis would publicly apologize to Patterson for his conduct during that campaign. \"Liz is an opponent who turned into a friend,\" Inglis said Saturday. \"We will definitely miss her and very much appreciate her pioneering leadership here in South Carolina and especially among South Carolina women.\" On Wednesday, Inglis sent a letter to the South Carolina Senate recommending her for the Order of the Palmetto. In it, he recounted how he joked with Patterson about his own defeat in 2010, that she could be happy \"at the turn of poetic justice.\" \"'Oh, no,' she said to me. 'I would never celebrate someone else's loss,'\" the letter states. Inglis continued: \"Perhaps one of the best ways to judge a person's character is to access their ability to forgive, to extend grace. Based on that standard, I can testify to Liz Patterson's exemplary character.\" Clyburn said he was friends with not only Patterson, but her husband, Dwight. They are all about the same age and got to know each other quite well, he said. \"One of the most disappointing nights in my life was also one of my most joyous nights,\" Clyburn said. \"It was when I was elected to Congress as the first African-American in 95 years, it was the same night Liz Patterson lost. We talked a lot about South Carolina's future and so looked forward to serving together, but it never came to that.\" Former South Carolina GOP Chairman Barry Wynn said Patterson represented the 4th Congressional District \"incredibly well.\" \"She loved the country more than she disliked her opponents,\" said Wynn, of Spartanburg. \"That is a quality we need more of in our elected officials. I have always been and admirer of Liz.\" In a recent interview with the Herald-Journal for a yet-to-be published article, Patterson was asked about what drove her to succeed. \"I hope that my work and dedication would make the world a better place and life better for the people in my community,\" she said.

University of Texas at Dallas ## Share A round-up of the best works of art to enter public collections recently University of Texas at Dallas The Barrett Collection of Swiss art This remarkable gift to the University of Texas at Dallas, comprising more than 400 works collected by Richard Barrett and his late wife Nona, has been described by Richard Brettell, the director of the university's Edith O'Donnell Institute of Art History, as 'the most important collection of Swiss art ever formed outside of Switzerland'. It includes works ranging from the late 14th to mid 20th century – by artists including Ferdinand Hodler, Caspar Wolf, Angelica Kauffman and Jean-Étienne Liotard. The gift will be housed in a new museum, named after the Barretts, which is set to open in the next few years. Ulysses on the Island of Circe (1793), Angelica Kauffman. University of Texas at Dallas J. Paul Getty Museum, Los AngelesChrist as the Man of Sorrows (1520–30), Quentin Metsys A pioneer of the Antwerp School at the start of 16th century, Quentin Metsys played a key role in reviving the precise realism and attention to the effects of light that had characterised Flemish painting of the previous century – yet his work also shows the influence of Italian quattrocento painters like Leonardo. This graphic depiction of Christ evinces the artist's talent for devotional portraiture. Before its recent acquisition by the museum, the work had remained in private hands, unknown to art historians, for centuries. The Getty Research Institute, meanwhile, also made an important acquisition last month – a collection of rare books, prints, and manuscripts related to the culinary arts, Christ as the Man of Sorrows (1520–30), Quentin Metsys. J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles Mauritshuis, The HagueMerry Company on a Terrace (c. 1616–17), Willem Buytewech Though Willem Buytewech was well known in Haarlem in the early 17th century, only six oil paintings by the artist have survived; this acquisition by the Mauritshuis is one of his finest. Alongside Frans Hals, Buytewech was a key figure in the early development of Dutch genre painting – one only has to glance at this group of fashionable, flirtatious youths, cavorting in their finery on the terrace, to understand why his peers affectionately christened him 'Witty Willem'. Merry Company on a Terrace (c. 1616–17), Willem Buytewech. Mauritshuis, The Hague Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe Portrait, probably of the Marquis of Marigny (1753), Jean Marc Nattier One of the most celebrated French portraitists of his day, Jean Marc Nattier only produced a small number of pastels in his career – over a period of around a decade from 1744, after he had already secured his fame as the painter to Queen Marie Leczinska. However, his works in the medium were widely praised; one was even described by a critic as 'surpassing all [the works] he has made in oil'. This painting, which probably depicts the Marquis of Marigny, is one of only nine surviving pastel portraits of men by Nattier.

This picturesque landscape records a moment during Simonsen's travels in Algeria. View of Algiers (c. 1840), Niels Simonsen.

The drawing has not been exhibited in public before now. Earlier this month, the Morgan also acquired 11 drawings by five major African-American artists from the southern USA.

Ambleston War Memorial Ambleston is a village situated in the heart of the Pembrokeshire countryside, about eight miles north of Haverfordwest. The Parish Church is dedicated to St. Mary, and lies in the centre of the village. There is a memorial hall in Ambleston, but I have as yet been unable to ascertain whether there are any war memorials in the village As a result, this page has been created to commemorate the men known to have lived in the village, and some may be unintentionally omitted. Any details or photographs of any memorials in the village would be much appreciated. The Great War, 1914-1918 Ebenezer George Griffiths, Driver, DM2/165522, Royal Army Service Corps.

The Division moved to France during January 1916, and fought on the Somme that year During 1917 it took part in the Third Battle of Ypres. The Division relieved 42nd Division in the front line at Givenchy on 15 February 1918 and faced numerous strong enemy raids in March. April was at first much quieter, but it was a lull before the storm, as the Germans launched another offensive here, with the Division taking part in the Battle of Estaires Sidney was wounded during this tumultuous period, and died of his wounds on 15 May 1918.

The citation appeared in the London Gazette of 17 October 1941 and read: 'This officer commanded a detachment of fighter aircraft which recently carried out a series of sorties with the object of assisting in the safe passage of our convoys in the Mediterranean Attacks were made on certain aerodromes and seaplane bases which resulted in a loss to the enemy of at least 49 aircraft and a further 42 damaged. The Successes achieved undoubtedly contributed largely to the fact that the convoys were able to proceed without loss; only 1 ship was damaged but it succeeded in reaching port. The courageous leadership and determination of this officer is worthy of the highest praise, and throughout he set an example which proved an inspiration to his fellow pilots.' He was then posted to 272 Squadron, and on 12 December 1941 was awarded the Distinguished Service Order: 'Since the operations in the Western Desert commenced this officer has led his squadron with conspicuous success. Enemy aerodromes, as far west of the battle area as Benghazi, have been attacked daily and other serious damage has been inflicted on the enemy. On the opening day of the operations a number of Junkers 52 aircraft, carrying troops, were encountered and 7 of them were shot down. In addition to a daily toll of enemy aircraft destroyed, heavy casualties have been inflicted on ground crews while lines of communication have been harassed and petrol tankers set on fire. Altogether, within a space of 6 days operations, no less than 46 of the enemy's aircraft were destroyed. Much of the brilliant successes achieved can be attributed to the courageous leadership and determination displayed by Wing Commander Yaxley. Throughout, he has set a magnificent example.' He had been home on leave during the early summer of 1943, and on 3 June 1943 was returning to North Africa to join 117 Squadron when the Hudson serial FK386, which he was travelling aboard, was lost over the Bay of Biscay.

The ASEAN Regional Business Council (RBC) will be launched in Ha Noi at the World Economic Forum on the Mekong Region. Comprising 25 ASEAN businesses and 30 global companies, the RBC will champion initiatives that call for trust and cooperation between the public and private sectors in the region. Focus will be on building infrastructure, promoting cross-border trade and investment in ASEAN, developing a digital economy, examining the future of jobs and industry in the region and championing the principles of inclusive growth. Nazir Razak, Chairman, CIMB Group Holdings, Malaysia, is the inaugural chair of the ASEAN RBC. \"Overcoming some of the biggest challenges in ASEAN depends on business and government working together. We want the RBC to help present the voice of business to government so that we can collectively deliver positive impact in the region and ensure that the hundreds of millions of young people across ASEAN have the brightest possible future,\" he said. \"The goal of the RBC is to contribute to unlocking ASEAN's outstanding potential\" said Justin Wood, Head of Asia Pacific, World Economic Forum. \"As the international organization for public-private cooperation, the Forum is a platform where stakeholders in society can meet in an environment of trust and impartiality to debate important ideas and catalyse action.\" Both Razak and Wood noted that the RBC will work closely with business groups in the region. The ASEAN Business Club will be involved in some of the RBC's work, notably to promote principles of economic integration. The RBC is expected to launch a number of other initiatives in the year ahead. Among them is a strategic infrastructure programme that promotes the concept of blended finance. ASEAN has a large infrastructure deficit that cannot be addressed through public investment alone. Private capital is needed, but many projects fail to secure funding because investors see them as too risky. Blended finance harnesses flows of official development assistance to alleviate these risks while also allowing private capital to be raised. Another key project promotes small- and medium-sized enterprises such that they achieve regional scale and become the next generation of ASEAN corporate champions. The World Economic Forum has been active in South-East Asia for 25 years and has achieved a number of public-private success stories there. Launched in 2014, Grow Asia is a partnership between the Forum and the ASEAN Secretariat. Its purpose is to improve the productivity and profitability of smallholder farmers and is funded by $10 million in official development assistance. It brings together governments, farmers and the businesses that buy the farmers' produce, to work on issues such as supply-chain efficiency and training in farming techniques. The World Economic Forum on the Mekong Region meeting in Ha Noi, Viet Nam brings together 180 leading representatives from major multinationals, large ASEAN and Asia-Pacific companies, as well as academia and civil society. The host country, Viet Nam, as well as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand are represented by heads of state, heads of government or senior ministerial delegations.

November 20, 2013 at 6:35 PM ## Exchange board votes to raise CEO's salary Posted by Amy Snow Landa The board of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange raised the salary of exchange CEO Richard Onizuka by 13 percent. The increase will boost Onizuka's annual salary from $157,000 to $177,400, retroactive to August. All of the board members in attendance voted in favor of the pay raise except one. Teresa Mosqeda, legislative and policy director for the Washington State Labor Council, voted against the motion. Mosqueda commended Onizuka's performance as CEO. But she said it seemed inappropriate to raise salaries \"when part of the goal of the Affordable Care Act was to decrease costs to the system.\" In recommending the raise, board chair Margaret Stanley cited pay equity as a consideration. She said the board hired an outside consultant to find out how Onizuka's salary compared with the salaries of CEOs at the other state-based insurance exchanges. The results of the analysis were not immediately available to the public. But Stanley said the pay increase would bring Onizuka's salary more in line with the salaries of the other CEOs. According to media reports, the CEO of Oregon's exchange, which still does not have a functioning website, makes $181,000 annually. Idaho's exchange CEO earns $175,000. The board sets executive compensation for the exchange, which is a public-private partnership separate from the state. The pay increase came up during the board's monthly meeting at a SeaTac hotel. After the meeting, Onizuka said the raise was a reflection of the work of the entire staff at the exchange, which has more than 100 salaried employees. \"It's not about me, it's about what we're doing,\" he said. \"I feel very humbled and honored to be able to do this.\" Board members praised the performance of Washington's exchange to date, especially compared with other exchanges that have run into more serious problems. For now, the exchanges are funded by federal money. Washington's exchange is on track to spend a total of more than $85 million through the end of 2013, according to Chief Financial Officer Bob Nakahara, who presented budget figures at the board meeting. The projected budget for 2014 is about $65 million, Nakahara said. But the exchange recently submitted a request to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for an additional $92 million to be spent on technological enhancements and other improvements in 2014. Starting in 2015, Washington – like the other state-based exchanges – will have to be financially self-sustaining. ### COMMENTS Click here to read the past comments No personal attacks or insults, no hate speech, no profanity.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "In November 2015 he finished clear first in the 6th Iberoamerican championship in Bilbao, winning this tournament for the second time.", "reference_documents": ["TITLE:  GM Lazaro Bruzon wins 6th Ibero-American Championship | Chessdom  RSS news Contact Us Chess News Chess Previews 2012 Chess Previews 2013 Chess Previews 2014 Chess Previews 2015 Chess Previews 2016 Chess videos Chess bits ## GM Lazaro Bruzon wins 6th Ibero-American Championship Nov 4, 2015 The Cuban Lazaro Bruzon has proclaimed this afternoon in Bilbao, the new Ibero-American chess champion after ending in a tie with the young talent Alan Pichot in a direct duel, in this last day. The Cuban has not suffered too much in this game because the Argentinian soon accepted the fact of ending in a tie. Official website/ LIVE games with analysis/ Standings and statistics This result has disrupted the final standings: Pichot, who have had the option to win the championship, was then put into fourth place after the tie. While the Latin-American 2008 champion, Julio Granda has passed over him and obtain the second post in the championship, after winning his game against the Argentinian talent, Peralta. To establish the final resume, the main referee Alvaro Soto, has had to make estimates of the results achieved together by the players; because there have been up to five, who tied with 7 points, including the representative of the Basque chess, Gabi Del Rio, who has finally been better local chess. On the last day of the 6th Ibero-American Chess Championship just half a point separated the Cuban and Argentina, first and second respectively in the standings. That difference is what allowed the Cuban obtain a draw with the black pieces and, on the contrary, pressing the 16 world runner-up champion, with the initial advantage of playing with white, victory over his opponent as sole a result that gave him the championship. Before the start of the final match, specialists crossed bets on the final result, and the vast majority bet the outcome to be a tie, not by a statistical issue most likely result among players of similar level, but by the apparent sport dilemma which Pichot a priori struggled with: go for the winning of the match in order to get the victory, with the risk of losing, or play for tables, as it was the minimum result he needed to leave Bilbao today as International Grandmaster. However, doubts were quickly dispelled by the Spaniard first move with which Argentinian stated a declaration of principles for a long game and decided to go against everything of his opponent, and his coordinated and organized black pieces; this technique is known in the Spanish slang as the \"Spanish torture\", consisting of trying to go slowly undermining Bruzón´s defences. The initial attack of the Argentinian was however weakened in around twenty moves, losing the initiative on the queenside, where he had focused its offensive. And from there, the game was mired as a resigned exchange of blows and pieces that led to the tie. With this result, Bruzón got for the second time, the Latin-American Title, and Pichot got the certificate of International Grandmaster, allowing him from now on, to get into the chess elite competing for the absolute world title. Both recognized at the end of the decisive game that the result has been obvious because Bruzón was played, in his words, in a \"peaceful\" way, in order to ensure the tie, and Pichot has recognized that its primary objective by participating at the Ibero-American Championship, was achieving brilliant results that would lead him to obtaining the title of grand master, and so it proved. With his victory today the Cuban Grand Master is the only chess player to have won twice the Latin American title, since it was also the first champion in the 2006 edition, which was also played in Spain. In successive editions of 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014, the winners were the Peruvian Julio Granda, Brazilian Gilberto Milos, the Spanish Ivan Salgado and champion until today, the Paraguayan Axel Bachmann. Born in the city of Holguin in 1982, the world junior champion in 2000, was also absolute national champion in 2004, 2005 and 2007. However, since that first win at the Iberoamerican distant 2006, in his sporting career Bruzón has been irregular up to his new victory today. Despite his youth, the Bonaerenesen player (a province in Argentina), born in 1998, has had time, in addition to proclaim himself today as the Ibero-American champion, to win last year´s in South Africa World Cup as the 16th runner-up, and to become, at the age of 15, the youngest international chess master in Argentine history. The great sporting disappointment has featured the Spanish chess player, Paco Vallejo, a priori the great favourite and finally disappearing anonymously half of the table away, despite the victory today against the Andorran player De la Riva, as a nice farewell. The outcome of the Ibero-American Championships has been exciting to the very end, as was the VIII Final Masters Bilbao Grand Slam, which ended last Sunday and was also decided on the final day in the direct duel against the board confronted the American So and the Dutch Giri, and continued in an agonizing playoff definitely won by So. In the VI Individual Ibero-American Championship there is a total of 92 payers, that belong to 16 associated countries with the Ibero-American Federation of chess: Andorra, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Spain, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay and Venezuela. So has taken the winning title of the after the final of Bilbao Masters Final to the five times world champion and current world runner-up, Viswanathan Anand. Before both of them, we can mention as Bilbao Masters Final two time champions to each of these players; the world number one and double world champion, Norwegian Magnus Carlsen, and double Olympic champion, Armenian Levon Aronian. In order to complete the list, we can mention the Bulgarian Veselin Topalov, who won the first edition in 2008 and his great rival and \"intimate enemy\", Russian Vladimir Kramnik, who won in 2010. The VI Iberoamerican Individual Chess Championship was played at the Champs Elysees Theatre of Bilbao since last October 26. The competition has been developed simultaneously with the VIII Final Masters Grand Slam, the other big event of the Bilbao Chess 2015, which ended two days ago, on Sunday, November 1, with the victory in the rapid games of the tie breaker of the US Wesley So against Dutch Anish Giri on. Bilbao Chess 2015 ended today with the closing ceremony in which Lazaro Buzón has been crowned with a popular beret, a typical hat in the Basque Country for distinguished champions. Mikel Alvarez, coordinator of Mayor´s Cityhall and councilor for the City of Bilbao Organization, has been the one to give away the trophy. As in previous editions, the two competitions have been streamed live on the Internet through the official website of the event, www.bilbaochess2015.com, and the main international portals of chess.

The tributes come on the centenary of Scott's party reaching the South Pole. The so-called Terra Nova expedition found that they had been beaten to the pole by a Norwegian team by 33 days, and on their return journey Scott and his four fellow explorers died. Some saw it as a mission of heroic failure, and Scott quickly became an iconic figure for his efforts. But in the later half of the 20th Century his status was re -examined by historians, some of whom questioned Scott's capabilities and contribution. Scott's granddaughter Dafila Scott told BBC News that it was time to re-evaluate his life and contribution. \"My grandfather's reputation has been through various ups and downs and this is a good time to reflect on the wider legacy and what they achieved not only in getting to the pole but the scientific work that they did,\" she said. He was the world's greatest polar explorer Ms Scott is a zoologist by training, but subsequently went on to become a painter and artist. She says that she is not surprised her grandfather became interested in science. \"There's no question that he was very much focused on the science,\" she said. \"The exploration was part of it but it was only part of it. In the Antarctic, there were and still are so many possibilities for things to discover. It's a wonderful place. It's an open air laboratory\". It is a view shared by Scott's grandson, Falcon, who has recently arrived at the Antarctic as part of a project by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust to restore the hut that was the base of operations on the North Shore of Cape Evans on Antarctica's Ross Island. Speaking from Scott Base he told BBC News: \"It's long overdue that his scientific legacy should be appreciated. It was a very significant part of the expedition. They undertook the science in very extreme conditions with amazing endurance. \"You only realise that when you come down here. There was no contact with the outside world and the risks were enormous.\" On his arrival at Scott Base two weeks ago, Falcon Scott went into his grandfather's hut alone so that he could fully take in the moment. \"It was like walking back in time,\" he said. \"There's a feeling of the presence of the man. There are still his possessions lying there, lots of tins of food that are well preserved and clothing on the beds. It was like the man had only just left it\". According to Heather Lane, curator and keeper of collections at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, the aim of the Terra Nova expedition was not just to get to the pole but also to do as much scientific investigation as possible. \"When Scott found out about the Norwegian team's plans to get to the pole first he makes a very clear decision to stick with the scientific programme,\" she said. She said there was \"enormous disappointment\" in getting there second, but \"he felt it was so important that they stick to the idea of the mapping and the science and the collection of the meteorological data all the way to the pole, and it was that that was going to be the long term legacy\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionElin Simonsson from the Natural History Museum shows artefacts from the Scott expedition to the South Pole There were 12 researchers on the expedition who were recruited by Scott himself. One member of his team, Charles Wright, wrote that \"if Scott had not been a Naval man he would have been a scientist\". That is a view shared by the British adventurer and Scott biographer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, who himself has crossed the Antarctic continent. \"He was a curious man, he was a very clever man. He was a brilliant man in every respect and he was the world's greatest polar explorer,\" Sir Ranulph told BBC News. The Terra Nova expedition was Scott's second excursion to the Antarctic. It was more ambitious in scope and its scientific aspirations than Scott's first trip on the Discovery expedition 10 years earlier. In his expedition prospectus, Scott wrote that Terra Nova's principal objective was \"to reach the South Pole, and to secure for the British Empire the glory of this achievement\". Of course, a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen reached the pole first. And Scott and his team never returned home, dying of starvation and exposure on the return journey. But alongside their bodies were several pounds of their precious geological samples and scientific notebooks which, even while approaching death through exhaustion, Scott and his men continued to take with them. Those samples and data are an enduring legacy of the Terra Nova expedition. The expedition was the ambitious scientific endeavour of its time, and it was the largest ever research mission to the pole - comprising 12 scientists including two biologists, three geologists and a meteorologist. The team collected specimens from 2,109 different animals. Of these, 401 were new to science. They also collected rock samples, penguin eggs and plant fossils. Image caption The expedition collected specimens from thousands of different animals One of the most important discoveries was a fossilised fern-like plant which was known to grow in India, Africa, New Zealand and Australia. It suggested that the climate 250 million years ago had been mild enough for trees to grow. More intriguingly, the discovery, along with other evidence gathered by Scott's team, was a hint that India, Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Antarctica had in the distant past all been part of one \"supercontinent\". Researchers now call this landmass Gondwanaland. It was around this time that the idea of continental drift was first put forward, independently, by the German scientist, Alfred Wegener. Scott's team also collected the first thorough set of weather data for the Antarctic, which has served as a baseline to track changes in weather patterns ever since. The team also travelled for five weeks to study an Emperor penguin colony come on to land and lay their eggs. The team took some of the eggs - which contained embryos - believing that they would shed more light on a possible link between birds and dinosaurs. According to David Wilson, the great nephew of Scott's chief of scientific staff, Dr Edward Wilson, their efforts illustrated just how passionate they were about the science. \"This was one of the greatest scientific questions of the time. But they had to go through extraordinary hardship to get the penguin eggs. It was minus 60C, so cold that their teeth cracked,\" he said. In the end, the eggs were of little use in this regard, but the efforts the men went to and the risks they took under the most extreme circumstances epitomise a spirit of heroic scientific investigation that arguably has not been matched since.

David Robson reports on their scientific legacy Impressive: Captain Scott and his team outside their huts in a rare photograph of the polar expedition By David Robson 8:00AM BST 21 Jun 2011 On the evening of June 22, 1911, a century ago tomorrow, Captain Robert Falcon Scott and his companions celebrated the winter solstice in their hut on Ross Island, off the coast of Antarctica. The promise of lengthening days came as blessed relief, and the first Midwinter Dinner – a feast still celebrated on the Continent today – was a lavish, jolly affair. The hut was festooned with flags, and there was a plentiful supply of champagne. The dinner began with seal soup, generally regarded as \"the cook's best concoction\", followed by roast beef and Yorkshires, a flaming plum pudding and all the Christmas trimmings. There were speeches, dancing and a glorious improvised tree. \"There is little to be said for the artificial uplifting of animal spirits, yet few could take great exception,\" wrote Scott. \"After all, we celebrated the birth of a season which, for weal or woe, must be numbered amongst the greatest in our lives.\" Everyone knows what happened next: Scott, beaten to the South Pole by Roald Amundsen, died a lonely death on the ice. But what few people realise is that Scott and his men were scientists. When the search party found the tent containing his body, and those of his two companions, on November 12, 1912, they also found rolls of photographs; a meteorological log which had been kept until March 13, scarcely two weeks before the probable date of their deaths; 16 kilograms of fossils gathered on the way back from the Pole; as well as Scott's diary, various letters to supporters, friends and the wives of his colleagues, and the famous Message To The Public. In a letter to his wife Kathleen, he wrote, of their two-year-old son Peter: \"Make the boy interested in natural history if you can; it is better than games.\" In a way, it was the perfect coda. Although this gruelling, tragic expedition can hardly be described as \"a game\", it was the apogee of the Victorian sporting ethos of manliness, endeavour, heroism, fortitude and honesty. Proposing a toast in 1910, Leonard Darwin, the son of Charles and president of the Royal Geographical Society, said: \"Captain Scott is going to prove once again that the manhood of the nation is not dead.\" When Amundsen beat Scott to the Pole partly by trickery, telling him he planned to head north to the Arctic, Darwin wrote to Kathleen that the Norwegian had not \"played the game\". ## Related Articles David Cameron praises Captain Scott of the Antarctic 23 Jun 2011 International Scott Centenary Expedition marches on 11 Mar 2011 There were some Antarctic expeditions whose only aim was to explore never-before-reached places – Amundsen and Shackleton's spring to mind. There were others – German, French, Japanese – whose only interest was science. But Scott treated scientific discovery and reaching the Pole as more or less equal priorities, very much in the spirit of the 19th-century ambition to show that man could conquer virtually everything. Travelling to the Earth's extreme places and coming to understand the world through science were parallel paths to that goal: Scott heroically travelled them both. His ship, the Terra Nova, set sail from Cardiff on June 15, 1910 and finally reached Antarctica at the beginning of the following year. There were 65 men all told, including 12 researchers – \"as impressive a group of scientists as had ever been on a polar expedition\", according to Scott's biographer, David Crane. A great deal of science 100 years ago consisted of collecting and identifying specimens. Scott's expedition delivered examples of 2,109 animals and fish, 401 of which had never been seen before. They also brought a huge number of rock samples, as well as Emperor penguin eggs and plant fossils. This was a sumptuous contribution to science, the raw material for all manner of research. Until then, glaciers had only been studied in Europe; the expedition's meteorological studies led to new insights into the polar weather and how it affected the climate of Australia. Two of the party, Thomas Griffith Taylor and the meteorologist George Simpson, were already established experts. But many of the scientists were young and inexperienced, distinguished chiefly by their passionate commitment. Charles Wright, the Canadian physicist who went on to become director of scientific research at the Admiralty, was 23 in 1910. He sent an application to Scott by post and was rejected, so he walked from Cambridge to London to apply in person. Wright later observed: \"If Scott hadn't been a naval man, he would have been a scientist; he had the mind of a scientist.\" The scientific staff were recruited by Scott and his friend and colleague Edward Wilson (\"Uncle Bill\"), and many went on to great eminence. Wilson himself was a doctor, who had been junior surgeon on Scott's 1901 Antarctic expedition on HMS Discovery. He was a deeply religious Christian who revered nature as the glory of God. An expert ornithologist and a phenomenally gifted artist, his illustrations of birds in Antarctica are among the Terra Nova expedition's great treasures. One of the most telling botanical items from the expedition was the fossilised Glossopteris, a fernlike plant known to grow in what was then called the Southern Continent (Australia, New Zealand, Africa, India). Along with the other samples of fossilised wood and leaves that were found in Scott and Wilson's tent, it proved that the climate in the Permian period, 250 million years ago, had been mild enough to support trees. But the discovery of the Glossopteris raised another question: had the Southern Continent and Antarctica once been one? In 1912, the German scientist Alfred Wegener had proposed his theory of continental drift, but few believed it. Only in the late Fifties was the movement of tectonic plates understood. For further proof of Scott and Wilson's devotion to science, consider the expedition to Cape Crozier. Scott's 1901 expedition had found a colony of Emperor penguins there, and Wilson had a burning desire to return to learn more. On June 27, 1911, he and \"Birdie\" Bowers – the other man whose body would be found in Scott's tent – embarked, with Apsley Cherry-Garrard, on what Wilson described as \"the weirdest bird's-nesting expedition that has ever been or ever will be\". It was a painful, five-week odyssey, the best example of the lengths to which Scott's men would go purely in the name of science. Scott called it \"one of the most gallant stories in Polar history\". \"Why should three sane and common-sense explorers be sledging away on a winter's night to a Cape which has only been visited before in daylight, and then with very great difficulty?\" asked Cherry-Garrard in his book The Worst Journey in the World. Because the Emperor penguin – which was six feet tall, never stepped on land, laid its eggs on ice during the winter, rested the eggs on its feet and pressed them to its abdomen for incubation – was \"probably the most primitive bird in the world\". After three weeks, during which they were sometimes unable to travel more than a mile a day, and the temperature could descend to -75F, they found the birds. \"We were witnessing a marvel of the natural world, and we were the first and only men who had ever done so,\" enthused Cherry-Garrard. \"We had within our grasp material which might prove of the utmost importance to science; we were turning theories into facts with every observation we made.\" Men had seen the Emperors before but never with their eggs; and they had never collected undamaged eggs containing embryos. Wilson believed they might reveal the missing evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds – he was wrong, but the surviving eggs and embryos remain much asked-for treasures of the Natural History Museum. Wilson would doubtless be pleased to know that the Emperor penguins, whose bodies they left in an igloo at Cape Crozier, were important control specimens in proving, 50 years later, that DDT had tainted the Antarctic atmosphere. When the survivors of Scott's expedition returned to Britain, in June 1913, much emphasis was put on its scientific achievements. Understandably so: while Scott was worshipped as a national hero, and Captain Oates as a martyr, they had been beaten to the Pole. Lord Curzon, the former Viceroy of India, declared that the publication of the expedition's scientific results would be the real monument to Scott and his men. That, perhaps, discounts the expedition's artistic legacy – Scott's journals; Cherry-Gerrard's account of the expedition and its tragic aftermath; Wilson's near-miraculous illustrations of birds; and The Great White Silence, the touching film made by expedition member Herbert Ponting. But the expedition's greatest scientific legacy is more substantial – namely, the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, founded in 1920 by Frank Debenham and Raymond Priestley, distinguished scientists who were in Scott's party, and initially financed by surplus donations to the fund for the expedition's widows and orphans. This fine international institution houses the greatest polar library in the world. And Scott left the nation another scientific legacy: Peter, the two-year-old son he hoped would be interested in natural history rather than games. Although not disinterested in the latter – he won a bronze medal in sailing at the 1936 Olympics – he became Britain's most famous conservationist and ornithologist, an artist and a television favourite. Captain Scott may have failed to become the first to reach the Pole – but for his contributions to science, he will be remembered for ever. • Next week, we reveal how the International Scott Centenary Expedition will visit Antarctica next year to carry out its own cutting-edge experiments, and how descendants of the original party, as well as the winner of a Telegraph competition, will retrace Scott's steps.

Variety Intelligence Platform February 2, 2014 1:05PM PT # Philip Seymour Hoffman Was Nearly Finished Shooting 'Hunger Games' ## Actor's sudden death will not delay release dates of 'Mockingjay' Parts 1 and 2 With Hollywood still in shock over the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Lionsgate was forced to consider how it will move forward with the industry's most lucrative franchise. \"The Hunger Games\" is currently in production on its final two installments. Hoffman, who was found dead Sunday morning in New York of an apparent drug overdose, joined the hit franchise in its most recent installment, \"Catching Fire,\" playing the game master Plutarch Heavensbee. That film grossed a giant $860 million at the worldwide box office. According to Lionsgate, the majority of Hoffman's scenes had been completed, with just seven days left to shoot on \"Mockingjay — Part 2.\" Release dates (Nov. 21, 2014 and Nov. 20, 2015) for either installment will not be affected, Lionsgate said. The \"Mockingjay\" shoot began in September in Atlanta and is planned to last into the spring, before shifting to Berlin and Paris for a month, ending in May. Both installments are shooting simultaneously. Lionsgate released a statement saying, \"Philip Seymour Hoffman was a singular talent and one of the most gifted actors of our generation. We're very fortunate that he graced our 'Hunger Games' family. Losing him in his prime is a tragedy, and we send our deepest condolences to Philip's family.\" Hoffman's part in the last \"Hunger Games\" became more significant by the end of the film, though it still was a supporting role. Hoffman's two completed films, \"A Most Wanted Man\" and \"God's Pocket,\" both have domestic distributors: Roadside Attractions and IFC, respectively. \"A Most Wanted Man\" still is scheduled to launch in August, according to Roadside, while IFC has yet to finalize release plans for \"God's Pocket,\" which the distrib just acquired at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Additionally, Hoffman was attached to direct the Prohibition era drama \"Ezekiel Moss,\" which Exclusive Media was set to start selling at the European Film Market in Berlin. The company released a statement saying it will not be presenting the film to buyers, \"while producers explore the next steps for the film.\" By comparison, Universal, which delayed the release of \"Fast and Furious 7\" following the death of Paul Walker, faced a much more daunting task given Walker's central role in the franchise, added to the fact that much of his footage had yet to be shot. \"Fast 7\" is slated to bow April 10, 2015. ### Popular on Variety Loading comments... ### Most Viewed ### 'Breaking Bad' Movie: Watch the First Teaser for 'El Camino' ### 'Breaking Bad' Movie Release Date, Title and Plot Revealed ### 'The Simpsons' Producers Talk Joining Disney, Potential Spinoff Series ### Must Read ### 'Breaking Bad' Movie: Watch the First Teaser for 'El Camino' ### 'Game of Thrones' Star Kit Harington Joins 'The Eternals' ### Tom Holland Addresses Spider-Man's Studio Divorce at D23 ### Sign Up for Daily Insider Newsletter Please fill out this field with valid email address. ### More Film ### Taylor Swift Downplays Association With Harvey Weinstein Taylor Swift's association with disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was among the topics the singer addressed in a revealing new interview with The Guardian.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Alice in Chains joined Velvet Revolver for a run of U.S. and Canadian gigs from August through October 2007.", "reference_documents": ["TITLE: Velvet Revolver Team With Alice In Chains For Summer Tour - MTV  AUTHOR: Archive-Chris-Harris  PUBLISHED DATETIME: 2007-05-22 19:02 # Velvet Revolver Team With Alice In Chains For Summer Tour Plus, VR channel Clint Eastwood in forthcoming 'She Builds Quick Machines' clip. archive-Chris-Harris NEW YORK — The rumors are indeed true: Velvet Revolver and the remaining members of Alice in Chains will be joining forces late this summer for a run of U.S. and Canadian gigs that will stretch well into the fall. But when you have two huge names on the same bill, the question one must ask is: Who will end up opening for whom? \"We'll be closing out the shows, as far as we know,\" Velvet guitarist Slash said with a gravelly laugh, adding that the trek, which kicks off in August, will run through October. Texan rockers Sparta have been tapped as the opening act for the tour's second leg, and Velvet Revolver are still mulling a number of potential openers for the trek's first half. While Alice in Chains' imminent plans remain something of a mystery, it is believed the reunited band has been working on new material, with plans to release a full-length LP in the not-so-distant future. Last year, Alice in Chains re-formed for a series of highly successful summer and fall gigs throughout the U.S. (see \"Alice In Chains Unlock North American Fall Tour\"), with Comes With the Fall frontman William DuVall taking over at the mic for the late Layne Staley, who died from a lethal mix of heroin and cocaine back in 2002 (see \"Layne Staley, Alice In Chains Singer, Dead At 34\"). Velvet frontman Scott Weiland said he didn't catch any of Alice in Chains' reunion shows last year, but he's looking forward to the matchup nonetheless. \"They're good friends of ours, and obviously they have amazing songs,\" he said. \"People have been saying the shows were amazing, and they were drawing some pretty big crowds, so we figured it would be kind of a cool gig. It would be fun to watch them play every night and listen to those songs.\" Before the tour, though, comes Libertad (see \"Scott Weiland Pumped For Velvet Revolver LP, Solo Collabo With Pharrell\"). Weiland and Slash agree that fans will be hearing a different Velvet Revolver when the band finally dishes the follow-up to 2004's Contraband on July 3. According to them, VR have become a collection of seasoned rockers who are more laid-back and comfortable with one another. \"The first record ... rocks with a real focus, and it is what it is,\" Weiland said. \"I think it's vicious, and we felt we had something to prove because people doubted us in a certain way. On this record, we'd been touring for 18 months straight, and [in that time], you learn how to be a band. You learn each other's idiosyncrasies and then there's a trust that develops from that. So when you want to try new things musically, you feel a lot more safe to be able to do that in the studio and when you are writing and recording. That's probably why this record has a bolder feel. It's a more soulful record, as well as more experimental.\" \"I think everybody just felt a lot more comfortable,\" Slash added. \"When we first started, we were just so excited to have four other guys to be able to do the same kind of thing with. That first record — it represents that period for us. But we've just grown over this period of time, and we stuck it out with each other, so the vibe is much more relaxed. Everybody just played what they wanted to play.\" Libertad will feature a dozen tracks in all. \"Get Out the Door\" is a funk-filled number that tells the story of \"someone tripping through West Hollywood and coming up upon a transvestite who they did not know was a transvestite and having an encounter that they weren't quite ready for,\" Weiland said. The album's likely second single, \"The Last Fight,\" relays the story of a soldier who spends his last night in the U.S. arguing with his lover before heading to fight overseas. A cover of Electric Light Orchestra's \"Can't Get It Out of My Head\" is also tossed into the mix. \"That was [producer Brendan O'Brien's] idea,\" Slash said. \"He goes, 'I have this great idea for a cover,' but then he wouldn't tell us what it was. Towards the end of the recording for this album, he finally comes out with it. I didn't know if we could cover that song, and I was against it at first. But I knew Scott was perfect to sing that sort of song. So Brendan was patient with me and had us just do an acoustic version of the track. The thing that did it for me was when Scott put a vocal on it. It just came out really good.\" Velvet Revolver recently shot a video for Libertad's first single, \"She Builds Quick Machines,\" with director Dean Karr (Marilyn Manson, Deftones). Weiland said the clip was \"fun to make\" and was born of an idea he's had for quite some time. \"We came up with this idea, and it just sort of coincided with the album idea and title,\" he said. \"It originally started as just a spaghetti Western and then morphed into a combination of a spaghetti Western married to this freedom-fighter concept,\" with a splash of \"City of God\" thrown in for kicks. \"We spoke with several different directors, and no one could wrap their head around that concept. It was a two-day shoot, and we had no idea if it would look like crap or if it was going to look amazing. We knew it had to be cool, that it had to have a vibe and it couldn't look cheesy. ... And it came out looking badass. \"I've always been such a huge fan of those spaghetti Westerns,\" continued Weiland, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Clint Eastwood — circa \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" — in the video. \"I always thought it would be cool to do a remake of 'A Fistful of Dollars,' so it was kind of a childhood dream to be able to do something like that.\" The video pits Velvet Revolver against a crew of bad men who kidnap a fallen angel — literally a chick with wings who falls like a meteor from high above the Earth, crashing into the desert sand with atomic force. The VR boys use explosives, Molotov cocktails and powerful six-shooters to exterminate the evildoers and rescue the winged woman. Originally, the treatment had Slash carrying matching black Les Pauls \"symmetrically, spinning the guitars in a manner similar to Bruce Lee's nunchuck scene meets 'V for Vendetta' 's classic knife fight. One of the bandits draws a knife but is pinned against the wall as Slash flings one of the guitars through his midsection.\" A second bandit would then start firing off shots at Slash, who'd deflect the bullets with his other axe. Sadly, the scene was never shot. Slash wasn't too jazzed about the idea. \"There was no way I was going to be doing that,\" Slash said. \"There's certain things you do with guitars, and there's a line where there's cool and uncool — and that stepped over that line.\" Alice in Chains Velvet Revolver Full Episodes Shows A-Z TV Schedule Shows News 2019 VMAs Are You The One?

Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian On Monday and Thursday mornings, at around 11 o'clock, I wander into an airless room with four microphones. Three other people walk in. We all say hello, and then we talk about football for about an hour or so. Some smart people edit out all the mistakes, and stick the results up on iTunes that afternoon. And that is how we make the Guardian Football Weekly. It isn't complicated, it isn't scripted, and that's probably why it works. If you have never listened to Football Weekly before, the show ranges from proper analysis of what has happened on the pitch in the UK and around Europe, to commentary about serious issues off it, balanced with some complete nonsense. I took over as presenter of the podcast – produced twice a week, despite the name – from James Richardson at the start of this football season. I would often cover for him when he was hosting World's Strongest Man or on holiday, so I knew my way around. In the past couple of weeks, we've covered all the football and the weekly crisis merry-go-round – Chelsea to Arsenal to Liverpool so far, with Crystal Palace a constant. We've also discussed the racism allegations surrounding the England women's football team, and the latest Fifa controversy. (Well, the latest at the point of writing; there will be another one tomorrow.) But we've also discussed a Spaniard missing a game because of an infected spot and a Scottish player drinking too much and falling in a river on his birthday. I like the nonsense. Fortunately there are producers there to keep me focused, at least part of the time. Every week about half a million people listen to Football Weekly, which the Guardian has been making for 11 years. There are buckets of football podcasts around, so the competition is pretty tough. Where we're lucky is that the Guardian has an amazing set of sports writers, most of whom are keen to come on the pod and are as good speaking out loud as they are on the page. I'm just there to ask them questions. Those questions begin in the form of a document shared by our producer, Jonathan Fisher. This will be on a Friday for the Monday Football Weekly pod, or a Tuesday for Thursday's edition. We will just dip into it whenever something happens and start adding in notes. If I'm not doing anything on a Saturday night, for example, I can stick a load of stuff in there after the games have happened. The night before we record, I'll write an intro. By then we will know which of the contributors are on, and which games they've been to, so we can think about what to ask whom. But we don't really want to script too much: it's better for me, and the listeners, if they just chat away and I sit there listening. I also work for Sky Sports, doing a predictions show with Paul Merson, and present a radio show on TalkSport. I like all of them to be as unscripted as possible. That's rarer in television, and it's of course riskier, but it's also way more fun – you get more highs and lows than something that has been scripted within an inch of its life. Fortunately there are always people on Twitter ready to let you know when you have hit a low point. On a day we're recording, I arrive at the office around 9.30am. Jason Phipps, the Guardian's head of audio, will hopefully have made a cafetiere. Jonathan will be complaining about his sore foot. And I'll proceed to be a bit too noisy for other staff working around me. I like to try to make Jonathan do all the stories from Europe. It's a shortcoming; for a decade now, I've been immersed in the Premier League for work and in the lower leagues and amateur football as a fan and as a player – so I haven't spent a lot of time watching La Liga and Serie A. I try to keep across it – it is my job now, after all – but there is a lot of football to watch, and you can't know everything. I'm lucky that Football Weekly contributors such as Paolo Bandini (on Italy) and Philippe Auclair (on France) are so ridiculously knowledgeable. When it comes to the panel, we try to find a balance between continuity for the listener, and introducing them to lots of different points of view. We have a lot of regular contributors who have featured on the show for years: Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson, Barney Ronay, Paul MacInnes, Jacob Steinberg, Amy Lawrence, Sid Lowe – apologies to those I've missed. But we're also trying to bring in other Guardian sports writers who have been less of a fixture on the show – it has been great to bring Paul Doyle back into the fold, for example. We're also looking to bring some interesting current and ex professionals on to the panel, along with some voices from outside the Guardian, but I'm very conscious that Football Weekly changing its presenter is already a massive deal for the show, so we're not trying to rush through any other change. So everyone arrives for the recording. Jonathan Wilson is late because he has been to the gym. The panel will have been sent a loose running order so they know what to expect, but not a script. We all have a glass of water and maybe a coffee in front of us, everyone says what they have had for breakfast to make sure their microphone is working, and then we start recording. We might stop occasionally just to ring Sid up, and people can stop mid-sentence if they like and re-record a bit, but I would rather just let it flow. When we're recording, I try to do the show \"as live\" – ie, if we need to go back and edit it for clarity, we can, but I tend not to stop and start it too much, or re-do segments. It's an approach that I like because it means people are really concentrating and focused. The knowledge that we can edit, however, means I'm happier to let conversations run on a bit in case we go off on a brilliant tangent, safe in the knowledge that it can be cut. When I got a call from the Guardian asking me to host Football Weekly and Football Weekly Extra, as a Guardian reader and someone who shares a lot of the Guardian's principles – and as someone who does the G2 crossword every morning – I genuinely felt honoured. And I love doing it. It doesn't take football too seriously – which is a relief, as so many places do. And I feel the listeners want the balance of knowledge and analysis with news of Sid's dog, whether Philippe will learn to drive, how Jonathan's new orthopaedic shoes are, or just Barry's life in general. I'm just waiting for the right moment to tell everyone about the time I borrowed Trevor Nelson's microwave … Catch up with Football Weekly episodes here, or subscribe via iTunes Inside the Guardian Reuse this content"], "label": "S", "category": "Wice", "additional_info": ""}

Variety Intelligence Platform April 14, 2016 2:54AM PT # Cannes 2016: Film Festival Unveils Official Selection Lineup ## Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen and Jodie Foster among the big American names screening their latest work in Cannes. CREDIT: Courtesy of TriStar Pictures Unveiling the Cannes official selection in Paris, festival president Pierre Lescure and artistic director Thierry Fremaux set the stage for an epic clash between the powers of good (including Steven Spielberg's big friendly giant, \"The BFG,\" and Shane Black's \"Nice Guys\") and evil (\"Money Monster\" and \"The Neon Demon\") among its English-language fare, which also includes new films from Jeff Nichols (\"Loving\"), Sean Penn (\"The Last Face\") and Jim Jarmusch — the latter bringing both bus-driver drama \"Paterson\" and Iggy Pop docu \"Gimme Danger.\" While paparazzi will have plenty of American stars to distract them on the red carpet — ranging from Shia LaBeouf (who headlines British director Andrea Arnold's \"American Honey\") to a double helping of Kristen Stewart (appearing in both \"Personal Shopper\" and the previously announced opening night film, Woody Allen's \"Cafe Society\") — the lineup also includes new work from such high-profile directors as Pedro Almodovar (\"Julieta\"), Park Chan-wook (\"The Handmaiden\") and Paul Verhoeven (\"Elle\"). The 49 titles unveiled on Thursday represent 28 countries in all, with an especially strong showing for Romania (with two films in competition, past Palme d'Or winner Cristian Mungiu's \"Graduation\" and Cristi Puiu's \"Sierra-Nevada,\" and debut \"Dogs\" in Un Certain Regard), Israel (\"Personal Affairs,\" \"Beyond the Mountains and Hills\") and, of course, France. While French producers and distributors exert intense pressure on Fremaux and his team, the big winner is American newcomer Amazon Studios, with five films in official selection. As for the global range of the lineup, such diversity is to be expected from the world's leading showcase for international cinema, though questions from the assembled journalists immediately revealed perceived blind spots in the lineup (\"No Italy!?\" \"Where's Mexico?\"). Fremaux shrugged off such concerns, stressing that the selection represents the best of the record-setting 1,869 features submitted for consideration. Regarding the complete absence of Italian filmmakers in competition (a mere year after three of the country's top directors wrestled for the Palme), Fremaux said the country's rising generation of filmmakers was repped by Stefano Mordini (\"Pericles the Black Man\") in Un Certain Regard, quipping, \"Italy is close to our heart, as this year's Cannes poster demonstrates!\" Still, with only two from Latin America (\"Acquarius,\" from Brazilian critic-turned-helmer Kleber Mendonca Filho, and Argentine-made \"The Long Night of Francisco Sanctis\") and two from Africa (NYU-schooled Egyptian director Mohamed Diab's \"Clash\" and Mahamat-Saleh Haroun's \"A Chad Tragedy\"), Fremaux should expect further questions in the coming weeks as to the largely Euro- and U.S.-centric lineup. Although there are only three female directors in competition — Arnold, Nicole Garcia (\"From the Land of the Moon\" and Maren Ade (\"Toni Erdmann\") — roughly one-fifth of the directors in the overall official selection are women. The Un Certain Regard section features the work of five additional female helmers — and showcases a younger crop of talent overall. Less crowded with \"the usual suspects\" than recent years, the competition runs the gamut of age and experience, making room for rising young talents — such as Nichols (whose \"Loving\" focuses on a mixed-race American couple arrested for miscegenation in 1958) and Canadian Xavier Dolan (\"It's Only the End of the World\") — alongside more well-established auteurs. It's little surprise to find previous Palme d'Or winners Ken Loach (\"I, Daniel Blake\") or Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (\"The Unknown Girl\") in competition, unless you count the fact that Loach had indicated he expected to retire after 2014's \"Jimmy's Hall.\" The programming committee poached just one film from this year's Sundance lineup, Matt Ross' \"Captain Fantastic,\" which stars Viggo Mortensen as an anti-establishment ex-hippie. Apart from \"Elle\" and Nicolas Winding Refn's \"The Neon Demon\" (which Fremaux called a \"cannibal horror movie set in the fashion world\"), the competition lineup is light on genre fare, though there are other juicy examples peppered throughout the rest of the official selection — including American director Michael O'Shea's debut \"Transfiguration\" (one of \"several vampire stories in this year's lineup,\" per Fremaux) and Na Hong-jin's gritty Korean crime thriller \"Goksung\". While the selection is nearly complete, Fremaux indicated that he might still add one or two titles in the coming weeks, later telling Variety that he's still waiting to see Asghar Farhadi's latest. That said, several much-anticipated films that cineastes hoped to discover in Cannes will definitely not be there, including Martin Scorsese's \"Silence\" and Kiyoshi Kurosawa's \"The Woman in the Silver Plate,\" neither of which is done, according to Fremaux. \"I have seen parts of it, but it's not ready even though it finished shooting last year,\" he said. Among the other conspicuous omissions was a closing night movie, which Fremaux explained by saying he instead plans to end the festival by re-screening whichever film wins the Palme d'Or. Asked if that change in strategy was a way to solve the eternal dilemma of finding a decent film to wrap the festival, Fremaux pointed out some closing films have been great successes in the history of Cannes, including Spielberg's \"E.T.\" and Ridley Scott's \"Thelma & Louise.\" But he acknowledged that the main problem with closing night is the fact that most people have already left by the end of the festival, which makes it a tough sell to convince filmmakers who want to provide the best showcase for their movies. By contrast, he hopes that repeating the Palme winner on closing night might bolster the slot's profile and trigger more interest in it. Addressing security concerns amid Europe's current terrorist turmoil, Lescure said the festival will be responsible for ensuring security inside the Palais and its immediate surroundings. \"We have staffed up with 599 security staff who are highly experienced,\" said Lescure, who added that the festival will be collaborating on a daily basis with local and regional authorities to provide the best possible security measures. Before the press conference, Lescure and Fremaux gave the floor to French entertainment workers and students who protested against the government's attempt to toughen labor laws for audiovisual, film and culture industryites. The Cannes Film Festival runs May 11-22. ## 2016 CANNES FILM FESTIVAL LINEUP ### OPENER \"Cafe Society\" (Woody Allen). The director's until-recently-untitled 1930s romance, which divides its time between Hollywood and the Bronx, stars Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg. His first feature to be shot in digital, \"Cafe Society\" was lensed by \"Apocalypse Now\" d.p. Vittorio Storaro and will be released later this year by Amazon Studios (rather than the director's usual distributor, Sony Pictures Classics). Allen was at Cannes just last year with \"Irrational Man.\" ## ### COMPETITION \"Aquarius\" (Kleber Mendonca Filho). Critic-turned-director Kleber Mendonça Filho's follow-up to 2012's \"Neighboring Sounds,\" one of the most talked-up Brazilian debuts of this decade, stars Sonia Braga (\"Kiss of the Spider Woman\") as a retired, widowed music writer, who also time travels. \"American Honey\" (Andrea Arnold, U.K.). The British director, who was invited to serve on the Cannes jury in 2012, has earned her fair share of honors from the festival, claiming jury prizes for both \"Red Road\" and \"Fish Tank\" in official competition. Her latest — and her first-ever American film — follows a group of young people who travel the country selling magazine subscriptions and making trouble, starring Sasha Lane, Shia LaBeouf and Riley Keough. A24 plans to release later this year. \"Elle\" (Paul Verhoeven, Netherlands). The \"Black Book\" director's first film to land in official competition since 1992's \"Basic Instinct,\" this thriller finds Verhoeven working in French for the first time. Former Cannes jury president Isabelle Huppert plays a top exec for a video-game company who turns the tables after being violated in a home invasion. \"From the Land of the Moon\" (Nicole Garcia, France). Adapted from Milena Agus' Italian novella about a young woman's romances, both real and imagined, from 1943 until the mid-'60s, this entry — which stars Marion Cotillard and looks to be one of the lineup's more crowd-pleasing entries — marks the third time the French actress-turned-helmer (\"Charlie Says\") has directed a feature in competition. \"Graduation,\" (Cristian Mungiu, Romania). A Palme d'Or winner for \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,\" Mungiu reportedly scaled back after \"Beyond the Hills\" (a Cannes screenplay winner), discreetly shooting his latest last summer in Romania. Following films about abortion and forbidden lesbian love, Mungiu's new project is remarkable in that it centers around a male protagonist, a small-town doctor played by Adrian Titieni. \"The Handmaiden\" (Park Chan-wook, S. Korea). This latest from the director of \"Old Boy\" — back in Cannes after 2009's \"Thirst\" — marks a return to Korean-language filmmaking after \"Stoker,\" although it takes its inspiration from British novelist Sarah Waters' \"Fingersmith\" (previously adapted for the BBC), in which a female pickpocket aligns with a con man to seduce and scam a wealthy Japanese heiress. Amazon Studios has U.S. rights. \"I, Daniel Blake\" (Ken Loach, U.K.). Britain's celebrated social realist has been a Cannes mainstay, screening 16 films in the fest (a dozen of them in competition) since the 1970 premiere of \"Kes\" in Critics' Week. His latest collaboration with screenwriter Paul Laverty (who wrote Loach's Palme d'Or winner, \"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\") centers on an injured carpenter and single mother struggling to get by on welfare. \"It's Only the End of the World\" (Xavier Dolan, Canada). After serving on the jury of last year's festival, the young Canadian director — who split the jury prize with Jean-Luc Godard for his last feature, \"Mommy\" — returns with this French-language drama, which stars Marion Cotillard, Lea Seydoux and Vincent Cassel. Inspired by Jean-Luc Lagarce's play \"Juste la fin du monde,\" the film follows a writer who returns home to announce his imminent death to his immediate family. \"Julieta\" (Pedro Almodovar, Spain). Taking inspiration from a trio of stories by Pulitzer winner Alice Munro included in her book \"Runaway,\" the Spanish director's latest celebration of a strong female protagonist stars Adriana Ugarte and Emma Suarez, who split the title role over the span of more than 30 years. This is the \"All About My Mother\" director's fourth film in competition. As usual, Sony Pictures Classics will release in the U.S. \"The Last Face\" (Sean Penn, U.S.). The controversial actor-director's new drama stars Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem as aid workers who fall in love against the backdrop of war-torn Liberia. The film marks a return to Cannes for Penn after his helming debut, \"The Indian Runner\" (1991, Directors' Fortnight), and \"The Pledge\" (2001, competition). Penn served as president of the official Cannes jury in 2008. \"Loving\" (Jeff Nichols, U.S.). Mere months after \"Midnight Special\" premiered at Berlin, Nichols will unveil this civil rights drama starring Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga as an interracial couple in 1958 Virginia. Set to open theatrically Nov. 4 through Focus Features, the film would mark a return to Cannes for Nichols after \"Take Shelter\" (2011, Critics' Week) and \"Mud\" (2012, competition). \"Ma' Rosa\" (Brillante Mendoza, Philippines). Little is known so far about the latest from the prolific Filipino auteur, who was in Cannes just last year with his Un Certain Regard entry, \"Trap.\" He was previously in competition with \"Kinatay\" (2009), which earned him the jury's directing prize, and \"Serbis\" (2008). \"The Neon Demon\" (Nicolas Winding Refn, Denmark). According to an early statement by the Danish director, \"After making 'Drive' and falling madly in love with the electricity of Los Angeles, I knew I had to return to tell the story of 'The Neon Demon,'\" a style-drenched horror movie in which Elle Fanning plays a young model preyed upon by jealous rivals. Amazon will release in the U.S. this summer. \"Paterson\" (Jim Jarmusch, U.S.). Adam Driver plays Paterson, a blue-collar bus driver who lives in the modest New Jersey city of the same name. He dabbles in poetry, encouraged by on-screen wife Golshifteh Farahani, in what's sure to be one of the film's more low-key entries — nothing like the director's last Cannes competition selection, \"Only Lovers Left Alive.\" Six of his pics have competed for the Palme. \"Personal Shopper\" (Olivier Assayas, France). Assayas' latest reunites him with Kristen Stewart, who won critical accolades and a supporting actress Cesar for \"Clouds of Sils Maria.\" Set in the world of Paris fashion and interwoven with supernatural elements, the intriguing project stars Stewart as an American woman working as personal shopper for a celebrity. Sales: Mk2. \"Sierra-Nevada\" (Cristi Puiu, Romania). One of the most revered Romanian filmmakers has remarkably never been in competition at Cannes; both \"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu\" and \"Aurora\" premiered in Un Certain Regard. That looks to change at last. His new film (which stars \"Lazarescu's\" Mimi Branescu\") is set around a contentious family reunion intended to commemorate the life of a recently deceased patriarch. \"Slack Bay\" (Bruno Dumont, France). After earning some of the best reviews of his career with \"Li'l Quinquin,\" Dumont seems determined to get even wackier, eschewing unknowns for established stars, including Fabrice Luchini and Juliette Binoche. Set in the same dreary corner of northern France where the director has always lived and worked, during the summer of 1910, the period comedy marks the director's third film in competition, following \"L'Humanite\" and \"Flanders.\" \"Staying Vertical\" (Alain Guiraudie, France). The director attracted international attention three years ago with \"Stranger by the Lake,\" a daring thriller set in a gay cruising spot. The edgy film earned him best director honors in Un Certain Regard and a handful of Cesar nominations at the end of the year. His latest feature, which turns on a film director who raises his young son alone, graduates to competition. Sales: Les Films du Losange. \"Toni Erdmann\" (Maren Ade, Germany). One of only three female directors in competition — and the first German to compete since Wim Wenders' \"Palermo Shooting\" in 2008 — Ade won the Silver Bear in Berlin for \"Everyone Else.\" Her third feature stars Peter Simonischek as a father convinced that his daughter (Sandra Huller) has lost her sense of humor, so he drops in on her in Bucharest and unleashes a series of jokes. \"The Unknown Girl\" (Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, Belgium). After casting movie stars Marion Cotillard and Cecile de France in their previous two films, the Belgian brothers cast the lesser-known but rising French star Adele Haenel (\"Love at First Fight\") alongside regulars Jeremie Renier and Olivier Gourmet in this story of a young doctor investigating the identity of a patient who died after being refused treatment. ## ### OUT OF COMPETITION \"The BFG\" (Steven Spielberg, U.S.). A reunion between former Cannes jury president Spielberg and \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial's\" (late) screenwriter Melissa Mathison, this all-ages Roald Dahl adaptation represents the biggest film on the Croisette, kicking off an international campaign for Disney's July 1 release. Mark Rylance plays the eponymous giant, while Rebecca Hall, Bill Hader and Jermaine Clement play more normal-sized characters. \"Goksung\" (Na Hong-jin, S. Korea). The gritty Korean genre director has been to Cannes twice before, with \"The Chaser\" (midnight, 2008) and \"The Yellow Sea\" (Un Certain Regard, 2011). Set in a remote village set into turmoil by a series of deaths, his ultra-stylish new film is told from the perspective of a police detective who comes to suspect that the crimes have something to do with his own daughter. Sales: Finecut. \"Money Monster\" (Jodie Foster, U.S.). George Clooney plays the host of a television financial-advice program taken hostage by an angry viewer (\"Unbroken's\" Jack O'Connell), who holds him responsible for a bad stock tip. Julia Roberts also stars as the show's tough-as-nails producer in a film that brings Foster back to Cannes 30 years after \"Taxi Driver\" unspooled in competition. \"Nice Guys\" (Shane Black, U.S.). Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling co-star in this late-'70s-set L.A. buddy comedy between a pair of not-quite cops, who don't hesitate to bend the rules while investigating a girl's disappearance. Black was previously in Cannes with \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,\" which screened out of competition, while Gosling infamously debuted his \"Lost River\" there two years ago. ## ### UN CERTAIN REGARD \"After the Storm\" (Hirokazu Kore-eda, Japan). Fremaux reiterated that Kore-ada's latest is a smaller film than last year's \"Our Little Sister,\" focusing on a washed up writer trying to make amends with his elderly mother and ex-wife in order to reconnect with his young son. \"Apprentice\" (Boo Junfeng, Singapore). Six years after his debut, \"Sandcastle,\" premiered in Critics' Week, the director delivers this intense prison-set drama, about a young correctional officer who finds himself befriending — and possibly being positioned to replace — the resident executioner. \"Beyond the Mountains and Hills\" (Eran Kolirin, Israel). The last time Kolirin screened one of his films in Un Certain Regard — with 2007 crowd-pleaser \"The Band's Visit\" — he went home with the FIPRESCI prize. \"Captain Fantastic\" (Matt Ross, U.S.). In the lone Sundance premiere to crack official selection, Viggo Mortensen plays an anti-establishment dad who raises his children in an American forest, until his wife's death forces the family to engage with the capitalist society he abhors. \"Clash\" (Mohamed Diab, Egypt). From the director of \"Cairo 678,\" this drama takes place entirely inside an overcrowded police truck packed with pro- and anti-Muslim Brotherhood demonstrators after a massive protest following the events of July 3, 2013, as crowds celebrated the ouster of prexy Mohamed Morsi. \"The Dancer\" (Stephanie Di Giusto, France). This 19th-century drama — and directorial debut — focuses on the life of American performer Loie Fuller, featuring two rising stars: French musician-turned-thesp Soko, who plays Fuller, and Lily Rose-Depp, who plays Isadora Duncan. \"The Disciple\" (Kirill Serebrennikov, Russia). Last seen on the festival circuit in Venice, where his 2012 feature \"Betrayal\" bowed in competition, the Russian helmer studied physics before turning his attention to drama, dividing his attention between film, TV and theater. \"Dogs\" (Bogdan Mirica, Romania). This debut feature concerns a city boy stuck trying to unload a patch of rural land inherited from his late grandfather, only to discover that the old man was once a local crime lord — which severely complicates his intention of selling the property, especially after a severed foot gives the local cop reason to retaliate on the gang. \"The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki\" (Juho Kuosmanen, Finland). Set in 1962 Helsinki, this black-and-white, comedy-laced drama follows the rise and fall of Finnish boxer Olli Maki, who fought the match of his life against the American world champion while obsessing about getting back with his girlfriend. \"Harmonium\" (Fukada Koji, Japan). The director's sixth feature follows the owner of a small workshop in a Japanese country village whose tranquil family life is turned upside down after he hires an old acquaintance and takes him under his wing. \"Inversion\" (Behnam Behzadi, Iran). With Tehran's air pollution at an all-time high, an obedient young woman must decide whether to leave the city with her ailing mother or challenge the decision and stay behind with a former sweetheart. \"The Long Night of Francisco Sanctis\" (Andrea Testa, Argentina). Screening in Cannes by way of Buenos Aires' Bafici festival, this '70s-set adaptation of the Humberto Costantini novel concerns a man who must decide whether to help two people wanted by the military under Jorge Rafael Videla's dictatorship. \"Pericles the Black Man\" (Stefano Mordini, Italy) Directed by Stefano Mordini (\"Steel\"), this noir — adapted from a cult Italian novel by Giuseppe Farrandino — stars Riccardo Scamarcio (\"My Brother is an Only Child\") as a slave-like hit man who disengages from the shackles of the mob world after meeting a woman. \"Personal Affairs\" (Maha Haj, Israel). Little is known about this debut from the female Israeli director is one of seven first features in the selection. \"The Red Turtle\" (Michael Dudok de Wit, Netherlands). Studio Ghibli's first international co-production is a creative collaboration between the Dutch-British director (an Oscar winner for his \"Father and Daughter\" short) and Isao Takahata. The multi-national film was scripted by \"Bird People's\" Pascale Ferran. \"The Stopover\" (Delphine Coulin, Muriel Coulin, France). The sophomore feature from the directors of \"17 Girls\" follows two girls who stop over in Cyprus for three days on their way home from Afghanistan. \"The Transfiguration\" (Michael O'Shea, U.S.). Another directorial debut, this one from an American director, the indie film was described by Fremaux as \"a New York vampire story.\" \"The Good Wife's\" Eric Ruffin plays the blood-sucker in question alongside Chloe Levine. ## ### MIDNIGHT SCREENINGS \"Gimme Danger\" (Jim Jarmusch). \"Train to Busan\" (Yeon Sang-ho) ### SPECIAL SCREENINGS \"Le Cancre\" (Paul Vecchiali, France). \"Exil\" (Rithy Panh, France). \"A Chad Tragedy\" (Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, Chad). \"The Last Beach\" (Thanos Anastopoulos, Davide Del Degan, France). \"Last Days of Louis XIV\" (Albert Serra, France).

Photograph: Simon Dawson/Reuters A Sky executive who lent a townhouse to Boris Johnson's leadership campaign and an academic who accused politicians of exaggerating racial prejudice were among Downing Street's controversial first appointments on Tuesday. Andrew Griffith, the chief financial officer and chief operating officer at the pay-TV group, has been appointed as the chief business adviser to Number 10. He will work closely with the new prime minister who reputedly said \"fuck business\" when confronted with companies' concerns over Brexit. Munira Mirza, who was a deputy mayor for Johnson throughout his time at City Hall, has been recruited to be head of Number 10's policy unit, Tory sources said. She was a prominent critic of Theresa May's racial disparities audit for public services, saying the \"scene was being set for another bout of political self-flagellation regarding the subject of race in Britain\". Quick guide #### Boris Johnson's to-do list A cabinet reshuffle The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. A complete clearout of May's remain-minded ministers provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though. The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May's departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy – something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs. If Brexit wasn't enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn't begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned. Managing parliament and Tory MPs Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn't tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the 'Gaukward squad' of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks. Loosening the purse strings Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters – especially Tory members – will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police. Everything non-Brexit This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider – during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May's government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration. Being prime ministerial Critics might say this is Johnson's single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor – an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers – Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary. Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 – a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech shows just how hard it is for him. Peter Walker Political correspondent The disclosures followed a frenetic day of rumours over who would be chosen by Johnson to advise the new Tory administration following his victory over Jeremy Hunt. Griffith's role will be to help Johnson rebuild ties with the business world amid fears that the new Conservative leader is happy to embrace a no-deal Brexit if he cannot come to an agreement with the EU before the 31 October deadline. He will be based full-time in 10 Downing Street from Wednesday, the first day of Johnson's premiership, Sky's chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, said in an email to staff. Griffith is expected to stand down from Sky while working for Johnson. The former Rothschild investment banker joined Sky in 1999, and became finance chief for the group in 2008. He was a key part of the team during the attempted takeover of Sky by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, when Murdoch's son James was chairman of the broadcaster. Johnson, who is expected to enter No 10 next week, has been spending up to 13 hours a day at Griffith's lavish £9.5m townhouse, with sources on his team saying he has switched his focus towards strategy for government. A Johnson campaign source said Griffith had kindly opened up his home to let members of the transition team meet there, but the businessman was not part of that operation. Griffith received about £17m after Sky was acquired by Comcast, which needed to buy out some of the stakes and share schemes held by Griffith and other staff in the group. He ran as a Tory parliamentary candidate for Corby in 2001 and 2005. He lost both times to Labour. Mirza, whose family came to the UK from Pakistan, criticised the Labour MP David Lammy's 2017 review of racism in the criminal justice system, which was commissioned by David Cameron and supported by May. She said it was an example of how \"astonishingly, it seems that a lot of people in politics think it's a good idea to exaggerate the problem of racism\". She disputed his view, and that of May, that the criminal justice system treats black people more harshly than white people, arguing that social and economic reasons lie behind the higher proportions of BAME people in prison – not institutional racism. Mirza wrote: \"Paradoxically, just at the point when racist attitudes were declining in society and many ethnic groups were integrating successfully, our political leaders became obsessed with racism … The tragedy is that accusations of institutional racism — and their official endorsement — have corroded BAME communities' trust in public services, thereby making things worse.\" Last summer, Mirza defended Johnson's controversial article that likened women in burqas to letterboxes and has been a long-term critic of multiculturalism as a policy choice. \"There are many people in this country who are uncomfortable about the burqa. When people argue we should use more sensitive language what they are really saying is let's not be critical at all, let's not offend, let's not criticise this practice because it upsets Muslims,\" she said. Mark Spencer, the 49-year-old MP for Sherwood, will become Johnson's chief whip. This is a key position as the new premier attempts to govern with a working Tory-DUP majority of just two. #### When does Boris Johnson become prime minister? With the confirmation that Boris Johnson has won the Tory leadership contest, he will formally take on the role of prime minister on Wednesday afternoon. Wednesday 24 JulyNoon: Theresa May will take her final PMQs in the Commons. She will then return to Downing Street and give a short final speech before heading to Buckingham Palace to formally resign as prime minister. Shortly afterwards, Johnson will head to the palace to be invited by the Queen to form a government and become prime minister. 4pm: Johnson is expected to give his first speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street. From 7pm there will be announcements on who will form his first cabinet. Thursday 25 JulyParliament sits for the last day before it begins the summer recess. Johnson is expected to address the Commons at 11:30, after the first meeting of his new cabinet at 8:30. Tuesday 3 SeptemberAfter a five-week break, parliament returns. Sunday 29 September-Tuesday 2 OctoberThe new prime minister will face their first Conservative party conference, which is being held in Manchester. His appointment was praised by MPs across the party. Long-serving Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames said he was a \"really excellent sane and wise choice\". The business minister Andrew Stephenson said: \"Congratulations to the new chief whip - the man who taught me how to 'put a bit of stick about'.\" Meanwhile, a former ambassador to Denmark and Foreign Office official is being tipped as Johnson's new Brexit negotiator. David Frost is a career diplomat and was head of Europe at the Foreign and Commonwealth office and and a former special adviser to Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary. He is currently chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry but has years of experience working with the EU. \"He believes there is a deal to be done and will pursue that,\" said one source who knows Frost. However there are also concerns, if his appointment is confirmed, that the key \"sherpa\" role is going to someone who is not a full-time member of the civil service. \"David is good, he knows Europe inside out, but Johnson will need someone at a senior level in the civil service who will be in charge of the day-to-day work,\" said the source.

B. White's Lesson for Debut Writers: It's Okay to Start Small Nicole Chung explains how an essay about sailing taught her to embrace her fears as she worked up to writing her memoir, All You Can Ever Know. Joe Fassler Oct 2, 2018 Doug McLean In her debut memoir, All You Can Ever Know, Nicole Chung tells a complicated origin story, exploring the questions raised by the circumstances of her birth. Throughout her young life, people wondered out loud—often clumsily, sometimes cruelly—how a child of Korean descent came to be raised by white parents in small-town Oregon. Chung sometimes wondered, too. But there were limits to her curiosity. She already had one loving family, and it seemed either impossible or unnecessary to go looking for the strangers tied to her by blood. It wasn't until she was in her late 20s, pregnant with a child of her own, that Chung became determined to go looking for her birth parents. That momentous decision sparked the journey of this book—an exacting, deeply personal inquiry into the mysteries of family, biology, and race. In a conversation for this series, Chung described a different sort of big decision: her choice to wait for years to tell this story. To illustrate, she shared a favorite passage from E. B. White's essay \"The Sea and the Wind That Blows,\" in which White describes himself as a passionate but hapless sailor who has gradually learned to pilot larger and more complicated boats. Chung sees aspects of her own approach in this: She came to writing late, working up confidence through a series of increasingly ambitious essays and editing projects. For her, the blank page is much like White's sea—a partner that inspires fear and reverence, and rewards bravery, humility, and, above all, patience. Nicole Chung is the editor in chief of Catapult and a former managing editor of The Toast. Her nonfiction has appeared in The New York Times, GQ, Longreads, and other publications. We spoke by phone. Nicole Chung: I grew up in Oregon, two or three hours from the Oregon coast. My grandparents had a boat—not a sailboat, but a small fishing boat we used for fishing and crabbing every summer in the bay, and in lakes and rivers closer to where we lived. So I grew up spending a lot of time on the water, even if I'd never been on a proper sailboat before. I think this experience must have been what started my obsession with sailing, a fascination that lasted throughout my youth. I loved nautical stories growing up, anything that featured characters going on a long journey across unfamiliar waters: books like Avi's The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, and Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels, and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. I was a girl from a working-class family, several hours from the ocean, but for a few years there I was convinced my destiny was to experience something like the good, non-tragic parts of that White Squall movie starring Scott Wolf. When I was 15, my Girl Scout troop spent a week learning to crew a historic wooden sailing ship that sailed from Port Townsend. It's not like we were real sailors. We did help the crew, working hard every day, but they had to tell us what to do. Still, we spent five amazing days sailing in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and it felt like the adventure I'd always wanted. It wasn't until later that sailing became important to me in a different way, a kind of guiding metaphor for the work I do as a writer. It started with an essay by E. B. White, a writer I'd loved all my life, beginning with books like Charlotte's Web and The Trumpet of the Swan. I don't remember a time when I wasn't just in awe of—and yet able to take for granted—the beautiful way White constructs his sentences. But when I was in my 20s, I came across \"The Sea and the Wind that Blows,\" an essay about sailing that I love for the way it makes me think of my own obsessions, how I started writing, and how I still approach every essay. It's about White's career as a solitary, not-especially-skilled sailor, and how he's still fearful every time he sets out on a new voyage. \"I liked to sail alone,\" White writes. \"Lacking instruction, I invented ways of getting things done, and I usually ended by doing them in a rather queer fashion, and so did not learn to sail properly, and still I cannot sail well, although I have been at it all my life.\" He talks about being in his 20s and 30s before realizing he was going about things the wrong way, with no clear idea how to read a chart or properly rig a sail, hurling himself at the water with the \"wariness and the ignorance of the early explorers.\" But White feels compelled to sail anyway, despite his clumsiness and lack of skill. The piece is about overcoming the fear that comes along with that. For me, it's hard to read this essay without thinking about my own relationship to writing. That's especially true in this passage: My earliest boats were so small that when the wind failed, or when I failed, I could switch to manual control—I could paddle or row home. But then I graduated to boats that only the wind was strong enough to move. When I first dropped off my mooring in such a boat, I was an hour getting up the nerve to cast off the pennant. Even now, with a thousand little voyages notched in my belt, I still I feel a memorial chill on casting off, as the gulls jeer and the empty mainsail claps. White describes how he progressed from smaller, more manageable boats to bigger boats and more challenging voyages. I think that's what writers do, too. Like White and his boats, I started small. I began writing mostly for myself, not really trying to publish during the entirety of my 20s, despite writing almost every day. I told myself there was no way I could ever make a living as a writer, so I would just claim writing as a hobby. Even in college, I never actually took a nonfiction class, though I did take some fiction and poetry courses. I'd never tried to write nonfiction at all, beyond the daily diary I've kept since kindergarten. I suppose my journals were forays into nonfiction, but I didn't really think of them that way. (I was so glad to have them later—they were such helpful sources to go back to as I wrote my book.) I joined a nonfiction writing group in my mid-20s. It was a period of my life before kids, before grad school, when I had more time—I just wanted to pursue different things I was interested in, so I joined a writing group and also took ballroom-dancing lessons. When I found that I really liked writing essays, it was kind of a shock. I kept writing and sharing with a few people at a time, but I would never have thought to publish those pieces. I've still never published them. Getting your sea legs is not a bad metaphor for what I was doing at that time. I was standing there, dipping my toes in the water, not really sure if I wanted to jump in. I didn't pitch or publish my first piece online until I was 30 or 31. I think it's useful for everyone, no matter what stage of their career they're at, to know it's okay to write for yourself first—sometimes only for yourself. There are going to be things that you might need to work out on the page, alone, before you're ready to share them more widely. I don't think there's always a rush. It's okay to take the longer voyage. I'm publishing my debut this year, at 37, and in publishing sometimes I feel like I'm surrounded by young geniuses. My editor is younger than I am, and has already written an acclaimed novel. I'm not really a late bloomer, but I think of myself that way sometimes—especially because I have published so many emerging writers at The Toast and at Catapult, many of whom started a full decade before I did. Ours is, I think, an industry that praises and rewards bravery and spunk (and youth, too). For good reason—writers who are fearless, who know they belong and rarely doubt themselves, have a kind of confidence and magnetism I sometimes wish I had. At the same time, while I can recognize and admire fearlessness in others, I suspect I wouldn't be the writer I am or have the career I have now if I hadn't started small, if I hadn't taken some time to do it alone for a while, slowly working up my nerve, testing my luck in little ways before I reached for loftier things. I remember the fear and the doubt, sometimes still feel it—and maybe at times it has held me back. But it also keeps me humble, makes me appreciate where I am, ensures I won't take anything for granted. Even now, I still feel anxious each time I open up a blank document and see a page waiting to be filled. White's anxiety about sailing stayed with him, too, and I love the way he captures the feelings of inadequacy that begin every voyage: \"Even now, with a thousand little voyages notched in my belt, I still feel a memorial chill on casting off.\" That so perfectly describes how I feel every time I start a new piece. My book is out soon. If you'd asked me last year or the year before, I would have said something much calmer and more confident about it. But right now I'm scared every single moment of every day. I think no matter how long I do it, no matter how many pieces I publish, there will linger this sense that I'm reaching for something bigger than I was meant to. But in the end, of course, I tell myself: You can do this. You can take that assignment. You can venture a little more outside your comfort zone. I don't think that fear, that \"memorial chill,\" is always a bad thing—it can be healthy and productive. It lets you know that you're doing something with high stakes. It reminds you that you have a responsibility to do your best work, and that you should approach it with respect. Still, there are times when it's good to listen to the feeling that you aren't quite ready to take a subject on. I was not ready to write this particular book in my 20s. Of course, some of the experiences were still taking place; I obviously couldn't have written about searching for my birth family before it happened. But apart from that practical concern, I think I needed those years to think about it and figure out what I really wanted to do—and if I really wanted to tell this deeply personal story. At the time it was happening, I wasn't even ready to think about sharing it with the wider world. It's taken me a lot of time to get comfortable, working up my nerve and testing my luck in small ways. Read Nicole Chung's essay on meeting her birth sister for the first time. I think the fear I'm talking about, the good kind, is more related to having big goals and big dreams as a writer. Maybe thinking that they're not possible, or feeling like they aren't a given, at least—and then doing them anyway. That kind of fear has been a mark of my career and something that I'm honestly a little bit grateful for. One last thing about White's essay: It's wonderful, though it's also very old-school when you think about it—I'm sure he's assuming that his audience is made up mostly of white men. That's kind of annoying, but it's also one of the reasons I've always gotten such a kick out of the essay. I'm sure when White was writing, he never thought about a young Asian woman who's barely ever sailed latching on to this piece and quoting it to people all the time. But that's what happened, and that's the power of a good piece of writing. No one can tell you it's not for you. We want to hear what you think about this article.

No, worse - it's the punchline they use in the trailer, which means they think it's one of the best lines in the show. And all those people in the studio audience laughed their heads off? This makes you think, as you think when you see nearly every sitcom trailer: how can they let this happen? How can prime-time TV comedy be like . . . this? Or is it just me? Do people set out to make sitcoms bland and unfunny? No, they don't. They try to make them funny. And sometimes they succeed. Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, who have written some really funny comedies (Birds Of A Feather, The New Statesman), and some less funny ones (Holding The Fort, Relative Strangers), believe that writers and editors never intend to create bland, safe laughs. 'What do you mean? We set out to create the kind of laughter that goes with the compulsive emptying of the bladder,' says Gran. Marks says: 'The script editor is going to spend his day sitting at a desk reading through 30 scripts. Your intention, as a writer, should be to make him fall off his chair in the first couple of pages.' But the process of making a sitcom - finding a funny idea, getting lots of people to discuss it in meetings, for weeks on end, then writing and rewriting it, finally having it performed in front of a nervous studio audience . . . the process is so complex and tortured that it's almost bound to fail. By the time the show is in the can, nobody knows if it's funny or not. They've heard the jokes a million times. The first real test of a comedy is a guy with a zapper, sitting at home, totally in control. Before that moment, by which time it's way too late, all the polls have been rigged. A STUDIO audience, 50 or 60 people, is standing outside the BBC's Television Centre, waiting to be led in by a security man. Their job is to laugh, and they're visibly nervous. What if it isn't funny? The sitcom is Sitting Pretty, by John Sullivan, who wrote Only Fools and Horses and Just Good Friends, which were funny. He also wrote Dear John, which wasn't very funny, and which has, like so many other sitcoms, slipped from our folk memory. This is a typical studio audience, cruelly described to me by a sitcom writer as a very 'checkout' crowd - bank tellers and shop assistants, grinning grannies, a traffic warden and his girlfriend, office workers whose companies have block-booked tickets. They file into Studio 2, a gloomy room with a stage and all kinds of rigs and contraptions hanging from the ceiling. On the stage is an untidy kitchen and a plush-looking sitting-room. Class conflict. We sit down. Sitting Pretty has come this far. Will the studio audience provide it with a decent laughter track? Three sets, four or five people who don't get on, but are forced to share cramped surroundings. That's sitcom. And sitcom is subject to these formal restrictions for very logical reasons. There aren't many people in it because the sets are small. The sets are small because you have to get them all on the same stage. And you have to get them all on the same stage because sitcom is, essentially, theatre: it works better with a studio audience. So you can hear the laughs as well as the joke. So you know when to laugh. This is the moment that the producers and script editors and writers dread, the moment which, they have deluded themselves, will signal whether the show is a hit or a miss. The warm-up man comes on; he's middle-aged, in sports jacket and tie, with bouffant grey hair, a boyish face. 'Now, if you're good,' he says, 'and if you give us a lot of spontaneous laughter, our executive producer, the award-winning Susie Belbin . . . well, she might just put all the drinks on the house.' Everybody titters. 'But then again,' he says, 'that's like Bernard Matthews saying 'Trust me' to a turkey.' And what happens next is fascinating. People laugh. Bernard Matthews] Trust me] A turkey] He's told a joke, which we understand, which we get. But this laugh sounds odd. It's not quite a sudden roar - it starts with a titter, and then everybody knows that everybody else has tittered, and then it comes, 'H . . . h . . . hah]' You can feel the relief. The warm-up man continues, as he will throughout the session, during all the difficult moments when cameras have to be moved, when scenes have to be reshot, when technical difficulties need to be resolved. He is brilliant. He works on the principle of fear and relief. He'll point somebody out. You think: my God, he's pointing. It'll be me next] And he says: 'Where do you come from?' 'Ilford' 'I'm sorry?' 'Uh, Ilford.' 'I heard you the first time. I'm just sorry.' And after he's got your heart in your mouth, he'll say something not particularly funny, but unthreatening. You laugh with relief. He points at the camera-crew, going about their hurried, fiddly business, and says: 'They're a great crew. One of the finest teams in captivity today.' And you laugh your head off. He's manoeuvred you into a position in which you are primed to laugh at unfunny jokes: absolutely ideal. And then he explains what Sitting Pretty is all about. It's about a rich woman whose husband dies. It turns out that he owed a fortune; now she's poor, now she must move back to her family - her hypochondriac idiot of a father, her wise old bird of a mother, her ex-hippie sister who's never moved out. And it's a family she's lorded it over for years - she's been a flash stole-wearing Mercedes-driver; they've stayed on in their crummy chicken farm. Like many sitcoms, it chimes in with the times: this is a Nineties comedy, a recession-comedy. The actors walk on, ready to run through the first scene. Diane Bull, who plays Annie, the central figure, gets in position. She's in the plush room, holding the phone in her hand. The cameras start to roll. Something is about to be revealed. Silence. Will it be funny? EVERYBODY involved in sitcom tells you the same thing - it's only funny if the characters are funny. It's not about jokes. And it's about 'real' people; in other words, people with contemporary problems. So the history of sitcom, from 1951's I Love Lucy the first-ever hit sitcom (wacky would-be independent housewife keeps finding out that home is best) to, say, last year's Bottom (two filthy sex-starved nerds fart and puke and keep failing to get off with girls), chronicles the break-up of the family, as well as reacting to every other minor social change across the decades. Think of a social change, and somebody will have written a sitcom on the back of it. Of course, they're not all intrinsically funny. Maurice Gran, who, with Laurence Marks, has written a new show called Get Back ('It's about this guy, he's a bit of a prat, who's made a lot of money in the Eighties and loses it in the slump, and he's forced to go and live with his father in some council flats'), says: 'They're all reflections of their particular era: Hancock was about a guy, he's just finished his National Service, he's got a bit of education, he wanted what (Harold) Macmillan was offering. Steptoe was about a young man, full of hope, in the Sixties, trying to escape his family's poverty. Till Death Us Do Part was about the crumbling of the East End.' And Get Back, like Sitting Pretty, is about people who were rich in the Eighties, and aren't rich now. You only have a handful of characters in a sitcom. That's the most important thing about it - there's absolutely no room for slack. So each character must have a believable conflict with every other character: if it works, you'll be primed to laugh the moment someone walks in on someone else. That's why so much sitcom is so bad - it's amazingly difficult to arrange. Julian Clary, whose new sitcom Terry And Julian has just started on Channel 4, says: 'Writing a sitcom is much more difficult and long-winded than I thought it would be. It's a lot more complicated than knocking out silly questions about sausages.' The show is about a heterosexual slob who is forced to take in a lodger. The lodger is the homosexual Clary. 'You can think of funny lines,' says Clary, 'but there has to be a reason for a funny line to be there, it has to be part of the plot. In a way, the funny lines are the last thing you put in. Now I realise how clever sitcoms are when they're good.' Of course, they're mostly not good. 'Writers,' says Anne Pivcevec, a comedy script editor at the BBC, 'are so lazy. I don't know why. They just don't understand how much work it takes, how much there is to think about. They just think: that's funny, and now I'll go on to the next thing.' The sitcom writer, Marks believes, must resist the temptation to rely purely on jokes rather than character-based situations. 'If you say the words bum, tits, knockers, or bollocks, they'll laugh,' he says. 'A man is sitting in a restaurant. The waiter comes. 'Is that bum soup or knocker soup?' People laugh at that. They laugh out of embarrasment. But you have to do much more than that - that's lazy.' But sitcoms routinely fail, not because they're lazy, but because they're not funny. They're just not funny, and nobody knows it, or why, until it's too late. Bad ones outnumber good ones three to one, but it's only the good ones you remember, which causes a nostalgia effect - sitcom always seems to be worse than it used to be. It's not. You remember The Likely Lads (Rip Van Winkle Terry comes back home after five years in the army, having missed out on the Sixties); you remember The Liver Birds (two girls sharing a flat; one of them feisty, the other a prude), but do you remember Mind Your Language (attractive young man works in a language school)? Do you remember Get Some In? You remember Citizen Smith, and Man About The House. But do you remember Holding the Fort, a 1980 sitcom written by Marks and Gran, starring Peter Davison and Patricia Hodge? They have a baby, and can't make ends meet; as an army officer, the woman has a higher earning potential than the man. So she goes back to work, and he looks after the baby. He says: 'I'm going in goal and you're . . . moving into the attack.' Or Relative Strangers, also by Marks and Gran, in which Matthew Kelly, an ex-hippie waster, is visited by a 17-year-old boy who turns out to be the son he never knew he had? He says: 'I can't be your dad, John, I wouldn't know where to start.' The kid says: 'You did once.' These are comedies written by brilliant writers. But somehow they didn't quite gel. And will we remember Second Thoughts in 10 years' time? Or So Haunt Me, in which a London household is inhabited by a Jewish ghost? Or After Henry, which is about a family after the father has died? Or The Upper Hand (successful woman, creative director of an ad agency, discovers that her status frightens men off, so she pretends to be a secretary)? Or, for that matter, the incredibly popular Fresh Fields, a present-day English version of I Love Lucy? THE THING about comedy is that everybody disagrees about it. You tell a joke; some laugh, some don't. And the further away you get from the actual joke, the worse it gets. What if your job is to tell the actor how to deliver the punchline? Or if you're the guy who reads the scripts and has to explain, to his boss, why they're funny? Think about it: your job depends on explaining jokes to your boss. You begin to share his sense of humour. And he, of course, has to guess what makes his boss giggle, who has built up a great feel for what tickles his boss . . . and so on, right up to the Head of Comedy. And what makes the Head of Comedy laugh? From the available evidence, neighbours popping in to borrow a cup of sugar at an inopportune moment, people pretending to be posh and living with Michael Elphick at the same time; that sort of thing. 'That's why sitcoms are usually so bland,' says Steve Coombes, who has written many sitcom episodes, including Birds of a Feather. 'The jokes have to pass through 11 sets of hands. The ones that make it are lowest-common-denominator jokes. They're bland and safe. Really good sitcoms happen by accident.' For various reasons, mainly because sitcom is cheap - small casts, hardly any filming outside the studio - television companies are striving to make more of them. So they're employing loads of people as comedy development specialists, 'comedic consultants', talent-spotters. These people trawl the clubs, or, alternatively, try to persuade established performers like Sean Hughes and Julian Clary to cross over to sitcom. 'Comedy is something that benefits from hard work, from going over it and over it, polishing every joke,' says Justin Sbresney of the BBC's new Comedy Development Unit. Sbresney, a fan of American sitcoms like Cheers, Roseanne, and Taxi, is interested in the American approach, in which large teams apply themselves to comedy scripts, polishing them and polishing them, putting more and more jokes in. Of course, this can work really well, if the team gets on. But it can be a nightmare if they don't. Cynthia Heimel, who wrote for the American version of Dear John, says: 'It's terrible. You all sit in a room: the Executive Producer, the Supervising Producer, the Producer, the Co-Producer, the Executive Story Editor, the Story Editor, and the Term writer. That's the hierarchical order. The writers get treated like dirt. It's incredibly competitive. Whose jokes do you think are the ones that get used? I wasn't even allowed to sit in the wrong chair. Network people are the scum of the earth.' Sbresney says pensively: 'You can never really be sure if it will work - it might look funny on the page, and not on the screen. Or the cast might not gel.' That's the thing about comedy. You just can't tell whether something is or isn't funny, until you laugh. Or don't. But everybody in comedy development has their theories. You've never heard so many theories. 'There are two types of joke,' says Steve Coombes. 'Jokes that teacher tells at the expense of the pupils, and jokes that are cracked at the expense of the teacher.' Paul de Vos, of the BBC, says: 'Who was it that said there were two basic jokes - fish out of water and the odd couple? Well, I think that's partly right.' The BBC has even produced 'guidelines for new writers', which says: 'Your initial pilot script must tell a self-contained story that introduces your main characters and sets up the premise from which the comic conflict will follow. Most importantly, it must be funny.' At the Edinburgh Festival, writers and producers are giving advice to an audience on how to write TV comedy. The talk is called 'No Laughing Matter'. After about five minutes, it's obvious that, while people agree that comedy should be funny, this is about the only thing they can agree on. 'All the writers I know,' says Rory McGrath, 'want to write good, challenging stuff. But the broadcasters don't think the public would tolerate that kind of thing.' 'Ooh]' says Mark Robson, LWT's Head of Light Entertainment. 'We have made some poor sitcoms, it's true. But there are pressures. You can't get it right all the time. You have to process things quickly. Instant success is demanded.' One of the problems with comedy writers, Robson continues, is that they are not prepared to adapt their writing to the market, to admit that writing is, in a sense, a business. 'Comedy writers just are not going to be able to write everything they want: they have to learn to adapt.' Ian Pattison, writer of Rab C Nesbitt, chimes in: 'Business was what I wanted to get away from when I became a writer] I mean, when a writer leaves his ego behind at the door, he also leaves his self-respect] You won't get a fresh original sitcom with the kind of approach that Mark has . . .' DIANE BULL puts down the phone. We're laughing. She's finding out all these terrible things - her husband has died, he was with another woman when he died, he hasn't left her any money. She goes to see her solicitor. She says: 'Don't beat about the bush.' 'He died owing a fortune.' 'Oh, go on - beat about the bush.' Between scenes, the warm-up man says: 'We've been listening to your spontaneous reactions, and our award-winning executive producer Susie Belbin, she likes you. What we used to do, we used to have spikes under the seats, and if you didn't laugh, we'd jab the spike up through the seat . . . we had to stop that, because people were coming back week after week for that.' In the next scene, Diane Bull talks about how she went to a party in the Sixties and saw Rod Stewart. 'Of course, he wasn't known in those days, so we just thought he was a bloke with a big nose and ignored him . . .' We laugh. We laugh a lot. But is it funny? Is she a good character? It's impossible to tell. Nobody will be able to tell until they switch on their set at home, sit down, and get the zapper in their hands. Then we'll know.

It's nothing personal. And it's not as if she's inaccessible. In fact, she's one of the more engaging interviewees one is likely to encounter: sharp, unguarded, down-to-earth, hilarious in a salty-tongued way. This willful indifference to the media is more an act of preservation than anything else. \"It's the only way I've been able to stay sane in these last 20 years,\" says the oft-decorated actress, who's being honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 17. The sentiment is not a recent affectation. Back in 2007, when she was being honored with a Britannia award from BAFTA/LA and had just garnered her fifth Oscar nomination, the message was the same. \"It's sort of a survival instinct on some level,\" she told Variety at the time. \"In some way I'm protecting myself against changing the way I do my job. I live and breathe and exist in a world where confidence is everything. I avoid reading reviews in the hope that I'm contributing to my little confidence tank.\" If anything, Winslet's \"confidence tank\" should be filled to the brim, since she routinely benefits from the kinds of reviews most actors only dream of. Even when the material doesn't rise to her level of commitment — such as \"Revolutionary Road\" (2008) and the more recent \"Labor Day,\" highly pedigreed films with disappointing receptions — Winslet has managed to escape unscathed. ### Related ### Sky Lands Kate Winslet, Rosamund Pike Animated Moomins Series ### Kate Winslet on Woody Allen, 'Wonder Wheel' and the 20th Anniversary of 'Titanic' Regarding \"Road,\" David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote: \"There isn't a banal moment in Winslet's performance — not a gesture, not a word,\" before declaring Winslet \"the best English-speaking film actress of her generation.\" \"The performances are superb,\" added USA Today's Claudia Puig in her otherwise lukewarm assessment. \"Labor Day\" encountered an even rockier road, having been neglected during the recent awards season almost entirely, save for Winslet's Golden Globe nomination. The issue for most was credibility in this tale of an agoraphobic divorcee who provides safe harbor for, then falls in love with, an escaped convict, despite the danger to her adolescent son. And yet Winslet was praised for her \"warmth, intelligence and sincerity\" by the notoriously thorny Rex Reed of the New York Observer, one of the film's few champions. \"Kate Winslet has such sound and reliable dramatic instincts she very nearly makes something of Adele,\" chimed in the Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips in his pan of the film. Her role in the upcoming \"Divergent,\" the first of a planned trilogy based on Veronica Roth's bestselling novels, could pose a similar challenge of acceptance. The parallels to another franchise based on popular young-adult fiction set in the dystopian future, \"The Hunger Games,\" could work for or against the series. The initial film, being released March 21 by \"Hunger Games\" distributor Lionsgate, will see Winslet play her first true villainness, Jeanine Matthews, leader of the Erudite Faction, an intelligence group at odds with the other factions (Abnegation, Amity, Candor and Dauntless). \"She has grand designs on pretty much taking over the entire factions system in not necessarily the most sound ways,\" explains Winslet of her character. \"She's a pretty nasty piece of work. I find myself likening her to sort of a female Hitler.\" The part is not only a departure for Winslet, but a night-and-day about-face from the role she tackled immediately prior, a French landscape gardener at Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV in \"A Little Chaos.\" Alan Rickman, who directed, also plays the Sun King. The concentrated timetable on the overlapping productions was partly due to the impending birth of Winslet's third child, which arrived in December. \"It was such a huge jump and I just had to throw myself at it,\" Winslet explains about wrapping one movie in England before flying to Chicago for \"Divergent.\" \"Everybody was suddenly cramming everything in before I got too pregnant. I was on set wearing a corset on a Monday, and on a completely different set by the Friday, wearing four-inch heels and a blonde, blunt-cut wig and wanting people dead.\" The new film also marks the first time Winslet will be playing a recurring character, having signed on for at least the second installment, \"Insurgent,\" which will be released a year down the line. \"I feel right about it because by the time I come to do the second one, I won't have gone away and played another character in between.\" The last time that happened was when Winslet took a hiatus from a TV show, \"Get Back,\" in her teens to play the homicidal Juliet Hulme in Peter Jackson's \"Heavenly Creatures,\" her feature debut. \"I'd gone off and played a schoolgirl who murdered somebody with a brick in a stocking,\" she recalls, \"and suddenly coming back playing a slightly chubby 15-year-old with Ray Winstone playing my father in a sitcom — it was like, 'Whoa, I don't know who I am anymore.' \" The heroine of \"Divergent,\" Beatrice Prior — the tale's equivalent of Katnis Everdeen — is played by rising star Shailene Woodley, whose career at this juncture Winslet likens to her own when she starred in the box office behemoth, \"Titanic.\" \"She's really such a wonderful, special girl,\" says Winslet about Woodley. \"And I feel very protective of her and I feel very excited for her as well. There are lots of things that are going to open up for her. And she's going to know how to make the right choices and she's going to absolutely navigate (her career) very steadily.\" With an Oscar for \"The Reader\" (2008), an Emmy for the miniseries \"Mildred Pierce\" (2011), three SAG awards and two BAFTAs, among several other kudos, Winslet nevertheless keeps raising the bar on her own career. After all, she's still in her 30s, which is remarkable given the fact that she's already worked with such directors as Jackson, Ang Lee, Roman Polanski, Todd Haynes, Steven Soderbergh and Jane Campion, to name just a few. \"I suppose the ultimate goal for me is to really keep doing my best and reinventing the wheel and to keep doing this,\" she says. \"And to never become complacent and to always strive to do better and work harder and think bigger. And when I say 'think bigger' I don't mean in terms of fame; I mean in terms of challenges that I hope I'm able to take on.\" Would that include acting on stage? \"To be honest, things come up often,\" she says. \"And I end up feeling agonized over turning things down or not being able to make something quite work because I have a family. \"I do yearn for the sort of brutal and raw challenge of theater because I know how much I would love it and I know how much I would get out of it. And I know much it would sort of keep everything awake. But I just can't do that right now.\" Loading comments... ### Most Viewed ### 'Grey's Anatomy' Season 14 Sees Another Series Regular Depart ### Olivia Colman Joins 'The Crown' as Queen Elizabeth for Seasons 3 and 4 ### BuzzFeed News Parts Ways With Three Entertainment Staffers After Identifying 'Holes' in Harvey Weinstein Coverage ### Must Read ### O'Reilly Dropped by Another Talent Agency ### Mark Halperin Out at NBC, MSNBC Amid Harassment Allegations ### 'American Vandal' Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix ### Sign Up for Breaking News Alerts Please fill out this field with valid email address. ### More Film ### Film News Roundup: Disney Channel's Mollee Gray to Star in 'A Night to Regret' No offense to entertainment journalists and film critics, but Kate Winslet doesn't read what they write about her.

Spike Lee's Bad 25 — which had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, Aug. 31, on the 25th anniversary of the album's release, and which will play in American movie houses before a Thanksgiving airing on ABC TV — shows the blend of inspiration and acuity that drove these two perfectionists in creating a worthy successor to their epochal 1982 album Thriller. Jackson said he meant bad \"in all good will,\" and in that sense the movie isn't bad. It's baaad, and great. On mirrors wherever he went after Thriller, Jackson scrawled \"100,000,000″ — the estimated worldwide sales of Thriller; still the best-selling album of all time and the winner of a record eight Grammy awards. Bad topped out at about 40 million, but it was the first album to birth five No. 1 singles (a record broken, we're embarrassed to note, by the six No. 1's from Katy Perry's Teenage Dreams CD). The Bad videos — or, as MJ insisted on calling them, \"short films\" — cemented Jackson's stature as a movie star who never appeared in a hit movie; thematically adventurous and expertly choreographed, they provided the crucial link between golden-age Hollywood musicals and YouTube. To extend the album's multimedia reach, Jackson toured for 16 months in 15 countries: 123 shows that displayed his preternatural performance gifts and supernatural footwork. (READ: TIME's oral history, The Making of Bad) Covering it all in a galloping 2hr.10min, Bad 25 is also a love letter from the often acerbic director, who at his Venice press conference underlined the influence Jackson had on the aspirations of a black kid in Brooklyn. \"I was born in 1957, he was born in '58,\"Lee said. \"And when I saw the Jackson Five on The Ed Sullivan Show, I wanted to be Michael Jackson. I had the Afro, the whole Jackson look. But the singing and dancing — that's where it stopped.\" (READ: Corliss's review of the Michael Jackson doc This Is It) No matter: Lee, who directed Jackson in the 1996 video for \"They Don't Care About Us,\" is a master of slick, sleek propulsion, as both interviewer and assembler of the all-time great making-of documentary. Like This Is It, the 2009 film of Jackson's preparation for the concert tour aborted by his death at the age of 50, this is a demonstration of the backstage agony and artistry. (LIST: See TIME's Top 10 Michael Jackson Everything) For Bad, Jackson wrote or cowrote most of the songs. Jones's maxim as a producer — \"You can't polish doodoo\" — led to an epic wrangle over which songs to include among the final 10 cuts. Engineer Bruce Swedien, the avuncular Wilford Brimley of microphone magic, would arrange the placement of musicians and backup singers, while Jones chose the supporting cast. The ballad \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" was intended as a duet with Whitney Houston or Barbra Streisand; instead it went to the little-known Siedah Garrett, a Jones protégé, with the young Sheryl Crow duetting with MJ on the tour. At the end of the six-month recording process, Garrett got another call: to write a ballad for the album's last track. She and Glen Ballard created the soaring \"Man in the Mirror,\" with choral work by The Winans and Andrae Crouch. After the session wrapped, Crouch suggested one last hymnal \"Change!\" The departing singers were called back from the parking lot to provide the song's spiritual capper. (SEE: a TIME video on Michael Jackson's movie career) Jackson's videos for Thriller had employed John Landis (for the title tune), Bob Giraldi (\"Beat It\") and Steve Barron (\"Billie Jean\"), setting the standard for the MTV minimovie. The \"Bad\" track would be helmed by Martin Scorsese, who had just directed The Color of Money from a Richard Price script. Price offered Jackson an inner-city faceoff scenario; as he says in Bad 25, \"Here's this asthmatic Italian and an asthmatic Jew\" helping the sheltered, showbiz black kid \"to show the brothers that he's down with them.\" The video, which costars a young Wesley Snipes (soon to be the star of Lee's Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever), was shot on the streets of Harlem. As Scorsese recalls, Michael \"looked around and said, 'Do people really live here?'\" (READ: Jay Cocks on the Michael Jackson video era) Bad 25 documents the conception and shooting of most of the album's videos, with testimony from their directors: Joe Pytka (\"The Way You Make Me Feel\" and \"Dirty Diana\"), Colin Chilvers (\"Smooth Criminal\") and California Raisins stop-motion auteur Will Vinton (\"Speed Demon\"). Tatiana Thombtzen, the slim model who could have been Michael Jackson as a female, recalls that Pytka advised her not to kiss Michael at the climax of \"The Way You Make Me Feel.\" A kiss would have been redundant: the two were such visual twins that romance approached narcissism. \"A lot of people misunderstand me,\" the singer said. \"That's 'cause they don't know me at all.\" The image a lot of people had of the star in the two decades after Bad was of a weird, sad soul who dated a chimp, disfigured his face, dangled his young son from a hotel window and pursued unusual liaisons with boys. Another Jackson is revealed here: the obsessed professional who worked for months in Jones's recording studio and at home with a \"B team\" of top musicians laying down demo tracks. He practiced his gliding, lurching dance steps with Soul Train alumnus Jeffrey Daniel and A Chorus Line cast member Gregg Burge. He pored over the dance films of Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Bob Fosse, writing in a note to himself, \"Study the greats and become greater.\" A record- and rule-breaker, Jackson also built on and improved on a century of American song and dance. (READ: Corliss on The Death of Peter Pan) \"I feel rejuvenated,\" Michael Jackson said of his Bad album, \"a jubilation.\" Bad 25 is an intimate view of a performer at his peak in the intense splendor of creativity. The movie ends with a magnificent rendition of \"The Man in the Mirror\" at Wembley Stadium in June 1988. Exhausted and exhausting, he gives his fans his unique all as singer, dancer, charismatic showman. ### SubscribePopular Among Subscribers #### Japan's Booming Sex Niche: Elder Porn #### Young Kids, Old Bodies #### Benedict Cumberbatch Talks Secrets, Leaks, and Sherlock #### Obama's Trauma Team Get all access to digital and printSubscribe Most Popular From Entertainment All-TIME 100 NovelsAll-TIME 100 MoviesAll-TIME 100 SongsThe Wolf of Wall Street: The True StoryCheat Sheet: Catching Up With the Last Two Years of The Office From Time.com ### Connect With TIME"], "label": "NS", "category": "Wice", "additional_info": ""}

Her Space Holiday The Awkward Off Vs. Howlies » ## The Awkward Off Vs. Los Campesinos! In the green room of the EARL in ATLANTA, GA, I was surrounded by members of LOS CAMPESINOS! For the whole interview, I concentrated on trying not to pick up their British accents…with limited success. In between laughter and tangents, we discussed the importance of an album as physical art, the internet's huge role in music, and starting up a Russian hamster fighting ring. They tried to convince me they were more music lovers than they were musicians, but their concert definitely proved otherwise. Full Transcript: (Audio) Nichole Bennett: This is Nichole with WSBF, and I am here with Los Campesinos! Los Campesinos!: Hi! NB: Would you guys like to go around the circle and introduce yourselves? Neil Turner: Hello, I'm Neil from Los Campesinos! and I play guitar. Gareth Paisey: I'm Gareth from Los Campesinos! and I sing. Oliver Briggs: I'm Ollie from Los Campesinos! and I play drums. Alex Berditchevskaia: I'm Alex from Los Campesinos! and I sing and play keyboards. Ellen Waddell: I'm Ellen, and I play bass. Tom Bromley: I'm Tom, and I play guitar. GP: There's normally Harriet as well, but she's not here because she's ill. She normally plays violin. NB: So tell me a little bit about your history. How did you guys get together? GP: We've been a band for getting on to three years now, which seems to have flown by. EW: That long? GP: It's weird because we still get called a new band. I guess there's not that much to tell. We started the band whilst we were at University. We then finished University. We released some records. We've toured…a lot. We've been to some really interesting places…some not so interesting places. It's been, generally speaking, a lot of fun. I guess the rest is just what happens to bands. TB: A series of clichés. NT: Lots of interviews. OB: Sex. GP: Tell them about that time! NB: So where did the name come from? GP: The name is Neil's fault. NT: Yeah, I used to speak some Spanish in school. It was just a word I knew. When it came time to think up a band name—it sounded fun. GP: It looks nice. It sounds nice. It's quite exotic to our English tongues. NB: So the exclamation point is the only thing keeping you from being a Peruvian band. I think there is a folk band there. Are you guys rivals? GP: We've not had the pleasure of meeting them. NB: So how is it? Is it just a mishmash of all sorts of things? The songwriting process, in general. Or if you don't want to answer the question, you can make up an story….at any point in the interview. GP: We've already given you the good story…Ollie's story. Back to the question. They'll write a song and then we'll take it as a band and it will develop through that. I will write some lyrics over top of that, and I guess that is the boiled down version of how to write a song. Lyrically, recently, I tend to write quite autobiographically and honestly. NB: We were speaking a little bit about the internet earlier. It's radically changed how a band gets out. It's definitely helped you guys along. How do you feel? Is it a negative and a positive thing at the same time? GP: I think, first of all, to say that it was anything else other than an absolute positive would be really ungrateful. We admit that if it wasn't for the internet, we would not be a band. In this case it was us recording a demo and putting it up on Myspace. Within five days of putting songs on Myspace, we were being offered record deals in Australia. We've not even been to Australia, so I think that shows just how powerful the internet was for us. TB: There are lots of negatives. GP: Yeah, there are things that the internet has changed the way people write about music and the way that people interact with music. TB: And the positive things massively outweigh the negatives. NB: Yeah, I think it levels the playing field. TB: Yeah, completely. GP: It has put a lot more power in the hand of bands as opposed to labels. It's getting where you can do a lot of things without a label. Obviously a label helps with putting a record out, but you don't need it to get heard. NB: As much as I hate Myspace at times, it is good at that. So I guess we could talk a little bit about the latest CD that has come out…the second one of the year. It comes with a lot of goodies. GP: It does. Sadly not as many in the U.S. as it does in the U.K. The U.K. version of the record is so much nicer than the U.S. version. It was a matter of record labels. NB: Yeah, you are on Arts & Crafts here. GP: And Wichita in the rest of the world. The Wichita version is infinitely nicer. The U.S. version is nice. It has the extra DVD and a sort of 'zine. NB: Yeah, I remember getting the package and thinking they had sent me a novel as well. GP: Yeah, I don't really like that package. Pretty cheap. It's just a lot of plastic and a lot of cardboard. NB: It is nice in that way, in our digital age, to have something physical. That's why I've gotten into vinyl lately. It's a piece of art. It's something you can own. GP: Yeah, you have to give people an incentive to buy something physical rather than downloading the album for free in the space of two minutes. So when it comes to packaging, we want it to be something that people are going to want to actually go to a record store and buy and enjoy it in more ways than just listening to it off a computer. So, I hope that more and more bands will consider things like that. TB: For me, I see doing things as a band the way that my favorite bands did. Like when you get a vinyl and it opens up three ways, it's like the best thing in the world. If we are in a position to do things like that, we will. Maybe we sort of romanticize about things like that. GP: We're music fans. We don't consider ourselves musicians at all. What we do is that we are several people who started a band who like a lot of music and are getting to do what people in bands that we like do. We want to be a band that we would like and be excited about ourselves. NB: I've heard rumors that this one is going to be pretty limited. Like one run? Is that true? GP: That is the idea. TB: In the U.K. they had to print some more, but I think that had to do with somebody fucked up the preorders. GP: They clearly over-ordered the record because we're more popular than we ever thought we were. TB: It's not really a proper second album, so were able to do something special with the packaging. It was more for people that really loved us. NB: Since we talked about you guys being more music-lovers than musicians, what is in your CD player right now or your iPod? What is really hitting you lately? GP: I've been listening to a lot of orchestral music. I've realized that as we've been on this tour, I've listened exclusively to OMD, The Smiths, Paul Simon, and Simon & Garfunkel. It's weird. I'm not sure how I feel about that. TB: Yeah, that's unusual for you, especially. GP: Yeah I don't know, but I'm loving it, especially those 80's drum sounds. OB: The drums are really good on Graceland. TB: I've been listening to Guided By Voices. NT: I've been listening to a band called Chlorox Girls from Portland. It was Tom's birthday yesterday. NB: Happy late! Is that what this cake is? Are they animals? And, what is your most embarrassing CD? NT: I have the whole Alice in Chains back catalogue. GP: I have Pearl Jam's CD. NB: One more. This is the only question that actually counts. If you were an animal, what would you be? TB: I'd probably be a cat. They are really cute, and they don't really do anything. They get lots of attention and don't do anything. GP: The thing is with questions like these, I'm totally incapable of giving and off-the-cuff answer. I have to really think about it. Neil just brought up a good point. I'm allergic to horses, and if I was a horse, would I still be allergic to them? I'll tell you. I wouldn't be a horse because I don't want to take that chance. OB: I'd probably be a monkey. GP: I can see that. TB: You're already halfway there. OB: I'll take that as a compliment. GP: I don't really want to be an animal, if we're being honest. I'd end up being eaten. What good animals are there? What do they actually do? OB: Should we pick something for you? TB: A vegan questioning the point of animals. GP: I don't like animals. That's why I don't want to eat them. What should I be Ollie? OB: What about some sort of bird? GP: If you were a monkey, what sort of animal would you want to hang out with? NT: I like Russian hamsters. OB: What is the difference between Russian hamsters and normal hamsters? NT: Russian hamsters are really cool. GP: A friend of mine had two Russian hamsters, and he named them after the Hardy Boys, Matt and Jeff. And they always used to fight each other. The thing about this is that the Hardy Boys were a tag team. So, it made no sense at all.

Photo galleries Dance and electronica Rap and hip hop Classical and opera Folk and traditional Choirs and brass bands A-Z of all artists # Los Campesinos! biography Last updated: 18 November 2008 The music began to come together: \"Glockenspiels, melody horns, cow bells, handclaps, Casiotone keyboards, silliness and indie snobbery were then thrown in to complete the mix,\" explains Tom. ## Members Aleksandra: vocals, melody horn Ellen: bass, vocals Gareth: vocals, glockenspiel, guitar Harriet: violin, keyboards, vocals Neil: guitar, vocals Ollie: drums, vocals Tom: guitar, vocals The music itself is an inventive, more charming British indie sound recognisable in a post-Libertines world with the saving grace of genuine intellect and humour. Oh, and top tunes help too. In June 2006 the band put the songs from their demo Hold On Now Youngster - You! Me! Dancing!, Death To Los Campesinos!, It Started With A Mixx and Sweet Dreams, Sweet Cheeks - on their MySpace page, and alerted alternative music site DrownedinSound to their presence. Word spread quickly, and soon many blog writers were singing their praises, local gigs sold out and labels started taking an interest. \"We didn't send out a single demo without being asked by a label,\" they later said. \"We've just got surprise and guilt at the fact that it was far too easy.\" The pick of their demos was the irrepressible You! Me! Dancing!, which quickly became their signature tune. It even referenced local indie disco night Twisted By Design, whose organisers put out the first official LC! release on their 2006 compilation. So far, so cosy. In November the band signed to indie label Wichita. \"Wichita know exactly what we're about, they're just an awesome label,\" Gareth told DrownedinSound. \"The first time they came to meet us, there was no business rubbish, they were just mates. Though, the main reason we signed with them was because they put more kisses at the end of their text messages than anyone else.\" The debut LC! single, the double a-side We Throw Parties, You Throw Knives/Don't Tell Me To Do The Math(s), was released in February 2007. The 1,200 copies of the yellow vinyl 7\" quickly sold out, though the band also gave away mp3s of both tracks on their website. Then came a spruced up version of You! Me! Dancing!, this time on red vinyl 7\" and limited to 2,000 copies. It was released in June 2007, the same month the band members went full time after finishing university. Los Campesinos! also signed to Canadian label Arts & Crafts, who released the Sticking Fingers Into Sockets EP in July that year. It was produced by David Newfeld of Broken Social Scene and collated a selection of their prior recordings. February 2008 saw the release of their debut album, Hold On Now, Youngster on Wichita Recordings. It was released in America in April 2008, with international touring to support the release. Less than 10 months after the release of their debut, a second album - We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed - was released, also on Wichita. They told Strange Glue, \"This is no post-album cash in. It's no B-Sides and rarities or 'songs that weren't good enough to be on the album cobbled together with some remixes and field recordings of Cardiff's indie scene'; it's 10 all-new tracks that none of you have ever heard before.\" In early 2009 the band recorded their third album, scheduled for release later this year. On 2 June 2009, a blog post by the band gave the news that founder member Aleks was to leave the band after an American tour, in order to pursue her studies. ## Bookmark this page: What are these? ## See also Los Campesinos! biography Photos: Los Campesinos! at Big Weekend 2010 Romance Is Boring Los Campesinos! photo gallery Indie and alternative music in Wales # Elsewhere on the BBC Los Campesinos! on BBC Music ## Elsewhere on the web Los Campesinos! official website Los Campesinos! on Myspace ## BBC Music ### Rock and indie All the latest rock and indie highlights from BBC Music. ## Flickr ### Join our group Showcase your Welsh music images on our Flickr group. ## Cymru ### Cerddoriaeth A-Z of Welsh language artists with biogs, sessions, reviews and gigs. ## Festivals and events ### Guides Get all the lowdown on some of Wales' key festivals and events. ## How to... ### Go to the show Our guide to where to find gigs and concerts in your area. ## BBC iD BBC iD Settings Sign out Search term: ## BBC navigation News Sport Weather iPlayer TV Radio More … CBBC CBeebies Comedy Food History Learning Music Science Nature Local Northern Ireland Scotland Wales Full A-Z of BBC sites ## BBC links Mobile site Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Accessibility Help Cookies Contact the BBC Parental Guidance BBC © 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "In September 2017, the Russian Ministry of Defence released a video showing two Su-25s helping to rescue  Russian troops encircled by Tahrir al-Sham militants.", "reference_documents": ["TITLE: Not-So-Soft Power: Russia's Military Police in Syria # Not-So-Soft Power: Russia's Military Police in Syria Mark Galeotti October 2, 2017 Earlier this month, in Syria's Idlib governorate, 29 Russians found themselves encircled by fighters from the rebel front Tahrir al-Sham (which Moscow still calls its old name, Jabhat al-Nusra). Moscow responded with a characteristic extravagance of firepower. The attack submarine Veliky Novgorod launched Kalibr cruise missiles. Su-25 ground attack aircraft flew sorties, while helicopters laden with Syrian and Russian commandos (including men from the elite Special Operations Command) flew in to extract the soldiers and then punish Tahrir al-Sham. Only three Russians were wounded and none died. What was unusual was that the men of this platoon serving in an exposed position were not Spetsnaz special forces, but members of the Voennaya politsiya, Russia's military police. Formed only in 2011, this military police force is now 20,000 strong and increasingly professional. With distinctive red berets and black brassards, they fill a long-discussed need in addressing crime and indiscipline within the ranks. Under Lt. Gen. Vladimir Ivanovskii, head of the Ministry of Defense's Main Directorate of Military Police, their effectiveness is still the subject of some public debate, especially as they have no real role investigating the massive levels of corruption and embezzlement in the military. However, as their growing role in Syria shows, they do represent a different face of the Russian army, and a potential instrument of a robust kind of soft power. The North Caucasian Battalions The first deployment of these military police to Syria began in December 2016 with a force of Chechens, drawn largely from the so-called \"Kadyrovtsy\" — the security forces loyal to republican strongman Ramzan Kadyrov. Although some accounts put their number as high as 500, their real strength was probably just under 400. The Chechens filled a variety of roles, ranging from convoy security to hearts-and-minds aid distribution missions in the ruins of Aleppo. Much was made of their ability to find common ground with the locals because of their Muslim faith, but their presence also represented two more cynical calculations: To Moscow, they represented a more disposable asset than ethnic Russian soldiers, given sensitivities at home about the political costs of casualties. To Grozny, they represented a token of loyalty. Kadyrov was being regarded with suspicion and concern by the Russian security elite after the embarrassing murder in Moscow of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. This way, he could demonstrate his value to Vladimir Putin, and also justify his continued control of Chechnya's security troops (for all that, they were formally now part of the new National Guard). They were withdrawn in March 2017, their tour having partly overlapped with a battalion of military police from neighboring Ingushetia. The Ingush troops, who were especially visible guarding Hmeymim Air Base and in Damascus, including fighting alongside Syrian Arab Army troops in its Jobar neighborhood, were also there because of politics at home. Ingush leader Yunus-bek Yevkurov, acutely conscious of Kadyrov's ambitions to extend his authority (until 1992, Chechnya and Ingushetia were conjoined), wanted also to show Moscow his value and loyalty. The Military Police in Syria Today This was the first time Russia had deployed military police abroad. The experiment was clearly considered a success, and Moscow is now deploying battalion-strength scratch military police units created from several constituent elements but with no particular ethnic identity. By July, four battalions were operating in Syria, for a total of almost 1,200 effectives. Their primary missions are providing security for Russian facilities and personnel, and manning checkpoints and observation stations monitoring the \"de-escalation zones\" being established in line with an agreement reached in Kazakhstan in May between Russia, Iran, and Turkey. According to the accounts of both journalists and others I have spoken to who have seen them on the ground, these military police appear to be relatively effective and professional, and they are likely to stay. (Recent photos of their Tigr light armored vehicles have shown them labeled in both Russian and Arabic.) The military police units offer Moscow several specific advantages. The units are disproportionately made up of professionals, making it easier to form contingents for overseas deployment, as they must be volunteers by law. It also means that the valuable experience they are gaining — especially useful for such a new force — is not going to be bled away quickly by conscripts ending their terms of service. This is also part of Russia's domestic and foreign PR campaign for a war that is not especially popular at home (in a recent survey, half wanted Russian forces pulled out of Syria). The presence and activities of the military police have been hyped heavily for domestic consumption, not just playing to the general militarist and nationalist agenda of the state-controlled media but also suggesting that Russia's role is both humanitarian and relatively casualty-free. With the bulk of combat casualties being sopped up by the \"Wagner\" pseudo-mercenary force (which is actually a government front, manned almost entirely by Russians, whose losses need not be acknowledged by Moscow), this is meant to assuage public concerns about their boys dying in a war about which they care relatively little. Future Prospects and Implications Finally, using military police allows Moscow to send soldiers able to fight if need be — although their primary role is not to be front-line grunts — but also burnish its battered reputation. Russia is considered in many countries in essentially negative terms, as an agent of anarchy on the global scale. However, the use of forces such as the military police which also have a potentially positive, even humanitarian, role is considered a way in which the Kremlin can balance deploying hard power assets with maintaining a soft power capacity. Since the 1990s, the Kremlin has looked to either deniable or legitimate instruments of coercive influence abroad. In the 1990s, it relied on proxy warriors such as rebels in Transnistria, often in order to create precisely the kind of situation into which Russian \"peacekeepers\" could then be deployed. Russia's 15th Independent Mechanized Brigade, based at Samara, is designated as a specialized peacekeeping force, although the presence of elements of the 15th in the Donbas during the winter of 2014 and spring of 2015 sheds doubt on whether this means anything practice. Nonetheless, these Mirotvorcheskie sily elements were deployed in Bosnia and Kosovo, and a battalion is still present in Transnistria. Since Putin came to power in 2000, and as his policy became increasingly aggressive, this became a growing priority, and fits into a wider approach of mobilizing a wide range of different instruments for both hard and soft power purposes. Proxies, from warlords to gangsters, were used in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine from 2014, but they are often of limited operational effectiveness and also hard to control. The creation of pseudo-mercenary organizations, first the ill-fated \"Slavonic Corps\" and then \"Wagner\", is precisely intended to create forces able to operate with a minimal level of deniability both to the outside world and to Russia's population. In this context, while the military police are first and foremost exactly what they seem, a long-needed response to a need within the Russian armed forces, they also provide another source of \"hard soft power.\" Ostensibly providers of law, order, and security, they are also combat assets, and their presence in harm's way can even — if one is working on a very ruthless calculus — justify the injection of more conventional military force when they come under threat. Certainly the incident recounted above in Syria was used as the pretext for a massive and much wider military assault which, according to Russian sources, killed hundreds of rebels, including five commanders. It also acquired a geopolitical dimension, as the Russian media lost no time in blaming Washington for the attack on its forces, asserting that the Americans controlled the al-Nusra Front and that the attack was \"initiated by U.S. secret services to stop the successful advance of the government troops to the east of Deir ez-Zor.\" Meanwhile, the Russians are angry about the death of Lt. Gen. Valery Asapov in shelling near Deir ez-Zor, which Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called \"the price paid with blood for the hypocrisy of American policy in Syria.\" The combination of these has meant that the military police have suddenly become the poster children of the Russian \"assistance mission\" to the Middle East. There is even speculation now that the military police will soon get their own TV series, sounding like an unlikely cross between U.S. blockbusters NCIS and The Unit. Watch this space.

We hold fortnightly meetings in Glasgow city centre and our critiques operate according to the Milford Rules. Members have a couple of weeks to read a submitted story or novel excerpt and prepare comments. Then, on the night of a discussion, with the author present, the other writers critique it, going around the table. After this the author of the piece gets to reply to their critique. It's a method that's worked exceedingly well for us over the years.

Well, here's an idea for you: stay in school! We can't all be Mark Zuckerberg, i.e., drop out of Harvard, launch Facebook, and become one of the youngest self-made billionaires of all time. Although many Internet entrepreneurs have found success after quitting college—like all four of Twitter's founders—there are far more who have stayed in school while also (or later) pursuing their ventures. It's not a bad idea, since you'll always have a degree to fall back on if your invention doesn't reach Facebook-phenom status. Just take a cue from this list of founders of some of the most popular stuff on the Web; they all boast pretty impressive educational accolades! Amazon founder Jeff Bezos earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton University. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in computer science. Both of Instagram's founders attended Stanford University as undergraduates. Kevin Systrom earned a B.S. in management science and engineering, while Mike Krieger graduated with a degree in symbolic systems. Krieger also attended grad school at Stanford, earning an M.S. in symbolic systems focused on human-computer interaction. The majority of LinkedIn's founders are Stanford University alumni as well. Konstantin Guericke earned a B.S. in engineering, Eric Ly received a B.S. in symbolic systems, Allen Blue studied drama and English, and Reid Hoffman was awarded a degree in cognitive science. Hoffman also holds a Master of Studies in philosophy from Oxford University. The company's fifth cofounder, Jean-Luc Valliant, earned an M.S. in computer science from the University of Marseille in France, as well as a postgraduate degree in network engineering from Télécom ParisTech. All three of Pinterest's founders had earned their bachelor's degrees before launching the popular visual discovery tool. Ben Silbermann graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in political science; Paul Sciarra also attended Yale, earning a B.A. in philosophy; and Evan Sharp was awarded a B.A. in history from the University of Chicago. Sharp earned his Master of Architecture at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation while working on Pinterest as a side project. YouTube cofounder Chad Hurley holds a B.A. in fine art from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, while his partners both graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Steve Chen earned a B.S. in computer science, while Jawed Karim studied computer science and engineering. Karim later earned a Master of Computer Science at Stanford University. Snapchat cofounder Bobby Murphy had graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in mathematical and computational science before he started working on the photo-messaging app. However, his friend and business partner Evan Spiegel dropped out of the school a few weeks before graduation (though he claims to have a B.S. in product design on his bio page). The story of Dropbox is similar to that of Snapchat. Cofounder Drew Houston received a B.S. in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before he helped create the online file-saving service. His partner Arash Ferdowsi also studied computer science at MIT but dropped out during his last year to work with Houston. The founders of Google each hold multiple degrees. Larry Page received his B.S. in computer engineering from the University of Michigan, while Sergey Brin graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a B.S. in computer science and mathematics. They met at Stanford University, where they both earned an M.S. in computer science. AirBnB cofounder Nathan Blecharczyk earned a degree in computer science from Harvard University. His partner, Brian Chesky, was awarded a Bachelor of Fine Arts in industrial design from the Rhode Island School of Design. Tim Westergren, one of the three founders of Pandora Internet radio, graduated from Stanford University with a B.A. in political science. Cofounder Jon Kraft also attended Stanford and holds a B.A. in human biology. Their partner Will Glaser went above and beyond, earning a triple major in computer science, mathematics, and physics from Cornell University. Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley graduated from Syracuse University with a B.A. in public communications. He was also awarded a Master of Professional Studies in the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. Cofounder Naveen Selvadurai earned both his bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. And last but not least, the founders of Buzzfeed are also well educated. Jonah Peretti (who also cofounded The Huffington Post) graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a degree in environmental studies. In addition, he holds an M.S. from the MIT Media Lab. Cofounder John Johnson earned a B.A. in philosophy and mathematics from St. John's College in Maryland. He later attended Columbia University for his master's in research methodology and quantitative methods.

Decoding History is a virtual field trip in which author David Baldacci takes students and teachers into the belly of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.(Photo: Travis Riggs, Creative Edge Studios) ### Story Highlights His webcast 'Decoding History' will take kids on a virtual field trip to the National Museum of American HistoryThe online tour is March 5, the same day he launches another venture for kids, the multiplatform '39 Clues'The author does not talk down or write down to his young audience: \"Kids are too smart for that\" Over 17 years, through 25 novels, David Baldacci has taken his adult readers on a roller-coaster ride of suspenseful stories packed with politicians, assassins and government agents. On March 5, he's changing gears and taking the kids for a spin. Decoding History, a virtual field trip in which Baldacci takes students and teachers into the belly of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, is being billed as a behind-the-scenes look at the precious artifacts that tell the story of our nation's history. \"Kids love the Internet, and we wanted to give them a visual, fun expedition through a place they might not have ever been to, and we did it in a fun way,\" Baldacci says. \"It's light and upbeat.\" The tour can be accessed at 1 p.m. ET/10 a.m. PT on March 5 at scholastic.com/decodinghistory. If kids who watch the webcast are half as excited as Baldacci, the Web tour should be a hit. Getting up close and personal with the museum's treasures, he says, \"was like Raiders of the Lost Ark at the last scene when the box goes into the warehouse. That's what the Smithsonian really is.\" David Baldacci discovers treasures of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in behind-the-scenes collection storage areas. (Photo: Scholastic) Among the items spotlighted are Abraham Lincoln's pocket watch, the Star-Spangled Banner (the flag that inspired the national anthem) and the compass used by Lewis and Clark during their transcontinental expedition in the early 19th century. The compass also plays a key role in Baldacci's next publishing venture. His new book for kids, The 39 Clues: Cahills vs. Vespers: Day of Doom, also arrives March 5. The multi-platform Clues, targeting kids ages 8-12, includes books — there are 15 million in print — collectible cards and an online game. The multi-author series Cahills vs. Vespers is a spin-off of the original 39 Clues series, which Scholastic kicked off in 2008. Doom is the sixth book in the Cahills vs. Vespers series and the first by Baldacci. EXCERPT: Read the first chapter of 'Day of Doom' \"What I like about The 39 Clues books is that they're deceptively educational,\" says Baldacci, 52. \"You have these incredibly fun, thriller stories with kids running around doing cool and dangerous things. But at the same time you're learning about geography and American history.\" Though Baldacci has written two other books for kids — his Freddy and the French Fries series features 9-year-old science geek Freddy Funkhouser — he says writing for young readers is always a challenge. Baldacci's newest 'The 39 Clues' book is 'Day of Doom.' \"I had to bring my A-plus game,\" Baldacci says, \"and I had to walk a fine line. I didn't want to bring in all the elements I might have in my adult thrillers obviously, but I had to bring a lot of the twists and turns and the plotting and the surprises and, yes, some of the danger as well. And I didn't write down to kids. Kids are too smart for that. I really had to write up to their expectations. It was quite a challenge.\" The virtual tour and 39 Clues aren't all that's keeping Baldacci busy these days. Coming up: \"I'm as busy as I can possibly be, and I don't think I can work any harder or write anymore, but I'm having a great time.\" David Baldacci • An as-yet-untitled TNT drama series, based on his Michelle Maxwell/Sean King novels about two former Secret Service agents turned private investigators, premieres this summer. It stars Rebecca Romijn (X-Men) and Jon Tenney (The Closer). \"I'm one of the producers. I'm jazzed about the series and really looking forward to it rolling out.\" The series will be based, in part, on the five novels Baldacci has written about these sleuths. • Wish You Well, the independent film based on his novel of the same name, is in post-production. Baldacci was the screenwriter and one of the producers. \"We filmed it in November last year in southwest Virginia. We have a number of distributors interested already, and we'll go the film festival route. It's a beautiful film, a coming-of-age story set in the 1940s, and I think we're going to surprise a lot of people with how good this film is.\" It stars Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn, Josh Lucas (Sweet Home, Alabama) and Mackenzie Foy (Renesmee in Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2). • The Hit, his 26th novel, will be published by Grand Central on April 23. It's a sequel to The Innocent, which reached No. 9 on USA TODAY's Best-Selling Books list last year. \"It's about government assassin Will Robie. In this novel, there's another killer in his organization who is every bit as good as he is, maybe better, and she's turned her barrel on people in her own agency. So they send Robie out to catch her. It's one of these stories where you have two equally matched people going after each other, and you're trying to figure out what the truth actually is.'' If it sounds as if the Golden Age of David Baldacci has begun, it's \"probably so,\" he says. \"I'm as busy as I can possibly be, and I don't think I can work any harder or write anymore, but I'm having a great time. It's fun to work on different projects and see them through.\" And everything he does seems to lead to another idea for a story. \"I always get inspiration,\" says Baldacci, whose novels have sold 110 million copies worldwide. \"I may not use the Lincoln watch, but boy that was pretty fascinating. That might end in a book somewhere.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/15jbxvSShare your feedback to help improve our site experience! ###### USA Today's Best-Selling Books List ### Dog Man: For Whom the Ball Rolls ### Dav Pilkey ### Where the Crawdads Sing ### Delia Owens ### Contraband ### Stuart Woods ### The Bitterroots ### C.J.

It was co-founded by our Lead Patron Sir Paul McCartney and Mark Featherstone-Witty, Founder, and is housed in his old school, which underwent a multi-million pound renovation to transform it into a state-of-the-art performing arts higher education institution. Today LIPA is an acknowledged part of the UK's higher education provision for the performing arts, recognised and ranked alongside institutions a lot older. LIPA provides learning for the main skills needed for putting on a show (performers and those who make performance possible), uniquely blending specialist and generic skills. LIPA offers degree courses in Acting, Applied Theatre and Community Drama, Creative Technologies & Performance (BA (Hons)/MArts programme), Dance, Management of Music, Entertainment, Theatre & Events, Music, Sound Technology, Theatre and Performance Design and Theatre and Performance Technology. We also run full-time one year Foundation Certificates in Acting, Dance and Popular Music and Music Technology. To further develop your skills we offer full-time one year masters-level degree courses in Acting (Company) and Costume Making. We train students for a future of sustained work. Most recent figures have shown that over the most recent four year period, 89% of LIPA's graduates are in work four years after leaving, while 78% work in the performing arts. To achieve this, our curriculum is constantly being revised. ## ​Courses We offer a range of programmes, including Foundation Certificate courses and undergraduate courses offering BA (Honours) Degree programmes for applicants aged 18 and over. Our courses are validated by Liverpool John Moores University ## Quality Assurance Agency - UK Quality Mark We are pleased to note the excellent outcome from the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA), following its review in May 2015. A team of QAA reviewers visited Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts and judged that its academic standards, the quality and enhancement of its student learning opportunities, and the quality of information about its learning opportunities all meet UK expectations. The review identifies a number of examples of good practice. These include: the comprehensive range of individually tailored and flexible support provided for studentsthe strategic approach to the use of deliberate and collaborative interdisciplinary practice, which prepares students for long term employability. The review made one recommendation for improvement: to work with the awarding body to clarify and implement the policy on assessment to ensure that students receive feedback and marks in a timely manner. QAA's Higher Education Reviews are carried out by experts from other universities and colleges. Every review team includes a student reviewer, because QAA believes that students should be partners in the quality assurance of their education. The team that reviewed Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts included Professor Hilary Grainger (University of the Arts, London), Associate Professor Alan Howard (University of Reading) and Laurence McNaughton (student reviewer from the University of Southampton). \"The quality marks we achieve are reassuring for many. This one from QAA is especially welcomed.\" - Mark Featherstone-Witty RNOM OBE Read the full QAA report here (external link) Please also see the agreed Action Plan: Action Plan Arising From QAA​​​​​ Higher Education Review​Student Representatives were consulted on the agreed action plan at the meeting of Institute Student Advisory Board on Thursday 26 November 2015 and confirmed that they endorsed the actions outlined. ## ​Teaching Excellence Framework Results Our teaching received the top Gold rating in the Government's Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) Awards, which were announced in June 2017.The award means that the TEF panel judged that LIPA delivers consistently outstanding teaching, learning and outcomes for its students. It is of the highest quality found in the UK.The TEF was introduced by the Government to build evidence about the performance of the UK's world-class higher education sector, complementing the existing Research Excellence Framework with an analysis of teaching and learning outcomes.

Coupled with a compulsory online safety briefing for all riders, Wiggle Amy's Gran Fondo aims to be the safest event in Australia. A 'Gran Fondo' is an age-old Italian cycling term, meaning 'great endurance'. Traditionally a Gran Fondo is a timed event that has a scenic, challenging, mountainous course. The distance, terrain and sensational scenery of the Surf Coast and Colac Otway regions makes for a challenging ride and the ideal location for a Gran Fondo. The 2019 event sees an additional 10km added to the course between Deans Marsh and Forrest. Although the course path towards Birregurra township has added to the overall kilometers covered, the elevation gained only varies from +1,870 m to +1,903 m in the change from the 2018 120km to the 2019 130km, showing a fast section.

Concerts and Events Oliver Zhang. In comparison, over 5,600 students turned out last year for FallFest, UCSD's traditional Fall Quarter event that Hullabaloo has since replaced. Due to budget cuts, A.S. Council cut the FallFest budget from $135,000 to $62,500. ASCE then decided to rename and rebrand the event so students would not be disappointed by a financially restricted FallFest. Unlike FallFest, which centered around music performers, Hullabaloo focused on creating a carnival atmosphere with rides and food trucks. \"Regardless of the budget cut, we would have had to reinvent FallFest anyways,\" Zhang said. \"Going through this experience and dealing with such a drastic budget cut for what's usually our second largest event of the year … has prepared our staff — especially the festivals team — to create an even better Sun God in the future.\"Elizabeth, a junior who wished to remain anonymous, said that she found the event more enjoyable than FallFest, but was still disappointed by the rides. \"I kind of arrived there pretty late because I was trying to avoid the crowds,\" she said. \"When I got there, I got signed in and got my wristband, and I was trying to get on the zipper ride, but the cut-off point was 10:30. I was really disappointed because the event was supposed to end at midnight.\" Musicians and DJs such as Felix Cartal, Jokers of the Scene and DJ Philly performed at the concert at Town Square. Food trucks such as Corner Cupcakes, Flippin Pizza, Tabe BBQ and Super Q were open throughout the night. \"I felt like I wasn't able to experience the whole experience of Hullabaloo,\" Elizabeth said. \"I didn't enjoy the music, not that I don't like that kind of music … it was just that the DJ was a bad DJ. The [food] was pretty expensive … I liked it more than FallFest just because it offered the carnival ride experience, but the cut-off was too early.\" Eleanor Roosevelt College freshman Krystal Tse, who arrived at Hullabaloo at around 6 p.m., said the festival compared favorably to her experience at Marshallpalooza — an annual event hosted by Thurgood Marshall Student Council which took place the day before, on Nov. 17. \"Compared to [Marshallpalooza], there weren't that many rides, but the music was better than yesterday's,\" Tse said. The festival staff did not run into any safety problems, and Zhang said administrators have been supportive of the event. \"That really cements the fact that there's going to be a lot of support for the event next year,\" Zhang said. \"And I think there's a lot of room to expand out, so I'm really excited that the next year's staff can carry it on and improve upon the festival.\" # Post navigation Davis Police Pepper Spray Student ProtestersQuicktakes-Stop Online Piracy Act ## Like us on Facebook"], "label": "NS", "category": "Wice", "additional_info": ""}

Cook This article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 8, (MUP), 1981 Sir William Dixson is a minor entry in this article Sir Hugh Dixson (1841-1926), tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist, and Thomas Storie (1854-1932), medical practitioner, were born on 29 January 1841 and 10 April 1854 in Sydney, sons of Hugh Dixson, tobacco manufacturer, and his wife Helen, née Craig. Hugh was educated at W. T. Cape's Elfred House Private School then worked for Phillip McMahon, a timber-merchant. In 1856 he entered his father's firm and, with his brother Robert, became a partner in 1864. On 3 July 1866 at Raymond Terrace he married Emma Elizabeth (1844-1922), daughter of William Edward Shaw; her sister Alice married Thomas Baker. The firm prospered, partly due to the impetus of the American Civil War, and expanded to Melbourne and Adelaide, where it became Robert Dixson & Co. On the death of his father in 1880 Dixson became head of Dixson & Sons Ltd and in 1883 built a massive warehouse and factory on the corner of Elizabeth and Park streets. In the late 1880s he introduced a profit-sharing scheme with employees. In 1903 he and his nephew (Sir) Hugh Denison organized the merger of the family companies with William Cameron Bros & Co. Pty, Melbourne; Dixson was chairman of the new British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Ltd. He was also chairman of the City Bank of Sydney, and the Strand Electric Lighting Co. Ltd, proprietor of the Strand Arcade and, in 1897-98, president of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales. In 1904 he set up and became chairman of the Dixson Trust Ltd. Staunch Baptists, Dixson and his wife originated many trust funds for the Church, including £10,000 for aged and infirm ministers. He was president of the Baptist Union of New South Wales in 1895-96, the Baptist Home Mission Society until 1926 and of the Young Men's Christian Association in 1900-02 and in 1909, and a director of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Lady Dixson was a life governor of the Queen Victoria Homes for Consumptives, the Women's Hospital, Crown Street, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and of the Infants' Home, Ashfield, a life vice-president of the British Empire League in Australia, the National Council of Women of New South Wales, and the Victoria League; president of the women's auxiliary of the Sydney City Mission and the Veterans' Home of New South Wales and vice-president of the New South Wales Home for Incurables, Ryde (to which they gave £20,000), and the Fresh Air League; she also founded the Sydney Medical Mission. Among Dixson's many benefactions were £5000 each to the Dreadnought Fund, the Chamber of Commerce War Food fund and the Y.M.C.A.'s building fund; and £7500 to the University of Sydney to buy a collection of minerals from the Barrier district; he and his wife were as charitable privately as publicly. Dixson was a noted horticulturist and became a member of the Linnean Society of New South Wales in 1887 and the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science in 1898. At his home, Abergeldie, Summer Hill, his garden contained many exotic and rare plants; he contributed articles to such journals as the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales. Bespectacled and bearded with curling side-whiskers, he was knighted in 1921. Lady Dixson enthusiastically collected rare china and owned a tea-service that had belonged to Marie Antoinette. She died in Sydney on 12 April 1922 and Sir Hugh at Colombo on 11 May 1926; they were survived by two of their six sons and by four daughters; one son Lieutenant Thomas Storie Dixson, Coldstream Guards, was killed on active service in France in World War I. Sir Hugh left his estate, valued for probate at £143,194, to his children and grandchildren. Thomas was educated at Sydney Grammar School and privately by Rev. Barzillai Quaife. At 18 he went to the University of Edinburgh (M.B., C.M., 1877), where he was influenced by Lister. He studied in Dublin, Berlin and Vienna before returning to Sydney, where he was appointed lecturer in materia medica and therapeutics at the University of Sydney in 1883-1917. He spent two years leave at the University of Strassburg (Strasbourg), Germany, where he isolated the poisonous principle of the castor oil bean and translated O. Schmiedeberg's Elements of Pharmacology (Edinburgh, 1887) under the author's supervision, to meet the need for a text-book in English-speaking universities. On 11 October 1887 at Inch, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, he married his first cousin Janet Maria Holdway Storie, and added Storie to his name. On his return to Sydney Dixson was honorary physician in 1889-1914, honorary consulting physician in 1914-21 and director of the department of special therapeutics in 1909-21 at Sydney Hospital. He helped to found the Renwick Hospital for Infants, was associated with the Greycliffe (Lady Edeline) Hospital for Babies, and the Sydney Medical Mission, and was president of the New South Wales Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind. Dixson was active on the New South Wales branch of the British Medical Association and was president of the Medical Board of New South Wales in 1919-32. He did devoted work for the St John Ambulance Brigade, published a pamphlet on its history in New South Wales in 1918, was appointed a knight of St John of Jerusalem in 1919 and was chief commissioner of the Commonwealth of Australia (Western Australia excepted) in 1923-32. He contributed several articles to the Australian Medical Journal. Interested in science from his university days, Dixson was a councillor of the Linnean Society of New South Wales for fifty years (1882-1932) and its president in 1903-05. In 1898 he became a trustee of the Australian Museum, Sydney, and was president in 1918-25; there he helped to organize popular lectures and planned a children's museum. He also contributed valuable information on the preservation and display of specimens. A member for forty-four years, he was an honorary vice-president of the Highland Society of New South Wales and a member of the Geographical Society. Dixson had suffered from diabetes for twenty years when he died on 9 December 1932 at his home, Edgewater, Cremorne; he was cremated with Presbyterian forms. He was survived by his wife and by three daughters; his estate was valued for probate at £7836. Sir Hugh Dixson's eldest surviving son SIR William (1870-1952), businessman and collector of Australiana, was born on 18 April 1870 in Sydney. Educated at All Saints College, Bathurst, he qualified as an engineer in Scotland in 1889-96. On his return to Sydney he worked for several years for Norman Selfe. He was a director of Dixson & Sons Ltd in 1899-1903, the British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Ltd in 1903-08, the City Bank of Sydney (1909-17) and of the Dixson Trust Ltd 1909-52 and Timbrol Ltd until 1952. William began collecting rare books and manuscripts for use in his 'own historical researches' but when he learned that the income from David Scott Mitchell's bequest to the Public Library of New South Wales could not be spent on pictures, he 'decided to give special attention to them'. Dixson first offered his pictures to the State in 1919 and again in 1924, adding that he would bequeath the remainder of his pictures and collections of Australiana, including manuscripts, books, coins and stamps, to the library on similar conditions to Mitchell's bequest: the Dixson Gallery was opened in October 1929. He later gave to the library other pictures, including a number by artists who accompanied Captain James Cook, its great bronze entrance doors, three stained-glass windows in the main reading room, and £15,000, the income of which is used to buy historical pictures. In 1937-39 Dixson gave a total of £5000 to assist in establishing a library at the New England University College, Armidale, which is named in his honour; he also presented some 1500 anthropological specimens from Australasia, New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago to the Australian Museum. He was a benefactor and fellow of the Royal Australian Historical Society, contributing many articles to its Journal, and a member of the Geographical, Royal and Linnean societies of New South Wales. Like his parents, he aided hospitals and institutions and was treasurer and president of the Queen Victoria Homes. He was knighted in 1939. Although 'reserved and retiring', he was a 'very kindly gentleman', with neatly brushed hair and a trim beard and moustache. He was a member of Killara Golf Club, and was an excellent photographer. Sir William, a bachelor, died in hospital at Chatswood on 17 August 1952 and was cremated with Anglican rites. His estate was valued for probate at £429,132; in addition to his promised bequests, he left all his shares in the British Tobacco Co. (Australia) Ltd (about £114,000) to the trustee of the Public Library to set up the William Dixson Foundation to benefit students by reproducing, with 'no editing whatsoever', manuscripts relating to Australasia and the Pacific, reprinting rare books and translating manuscripts into English. The Dixson Library, housing his great collections, was opened in 1959. A portrait of Sir William by Norman Carter is held by the University of New England and Lionel Lindsay did a portrait etching. ### Select Bibliography Cyclopedia of N.S.W. (Syd, 1907)D. H.

The arrival of hordes of worshippers coming to see the extraordinary tabernacle led to the church's construction, designed by the Grand Duke's court architect Gherardo Mechini. The church, built according to the style of the Counter-Reformation, is considered one of the best conserved examples of post-Mannerist Florentine architecture. The interior is accessed through a Tuscan-order porch, where pilgrims once found refuge, and drenched in a well-installed light that directs our attention to the back wall, where the high altar is dominated from above by a large arch. This is where you can find an altarpiece by Mario Balassi from 1638, which juxtaposes well with the fresco at the centre of the wall depicting the miraculous event, attributed to Giovanni Bonsi. Some other works conserved in the church include paintings from the 1800s by Matteo Bertini and an 18th-century canvas painting of St. Theresa by Gherardini.

Politicians are known to kiss babies. But Lisa Bender, the DFL-endorsed candidate running to represent Uptown-area Ward 10 on the Minneapolis City Council, has gone further: Just a month before election day, she had one. This Sunday, Lisa and her husband, Ryan, welcomed their second baby daughter, Isabel Rose, at the Minnesota Birth Center. Think backwards here: All summer long, including those 90-degree days, Bender was knocking on doors while seven, eight, nine months pregnant. \"A lot of people were a little surprised to have a pregnant woman knocking on their door asking for their vote,\" Bender says, laughing. See Also: Amber Dallman gave birth after riding Nice Ride to hospital While training for Grandma's Half Marathon, Duluth woman has surprise baby Bender on her \"due date door knock.\" [jump] But Bender was undaunted. She had already been through an intense pregnancy: In the summer of 2010, eleven weeks pregnant with the couple's first child, Bender went to her doctor with a question about a lump in her right breast. The diagnosis came back malignant: Bender had breast cancer. Bender started enduring chemo at the same time she went to ultrasound appointments; she lost her hair while her stomach grew. In March 2011, Bender gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Alice. This winter, the Benders decided to try for a second baby, but doctors warned them that due to Lisa's medical history, baby number two might take awhile. Not long after that decision, Lisa -- the 35-year-old founder of the Minneapolis Bicycle Coalition, and resident of Lowry Hill East since 2009 -- declared her candidacy in Ward 10. One month into her campaign, Bender realized she was pregnant. \"It was a very nice surprise,\" she says. The news didn't change her thoughts about the race. There were four candidates seeking the DFL endorsement, Bender remembers, and the road to the election seemed like a long one. \"My husband and I talked about it and we figured, well, we don't know what's going to happen,\" Bender says. \"We might end up with no baby and no election, or we might have a really great exciting fall, so let's keep moving forward.\" In April, Bender snagged the DFL endorsement over her competitors, including incumbent Meg Tuthill, who remains in the race. After that, her campaign kicked into high gear. Knowing that her due date was one month before the election, Bender planned an aggressive summer and early fall to get out ahead, and started knocking on doors six days per week, carrying two bottles of water with her as she walked around the neighborhood. Early on, Bender says, a lot of the people who answered the door asked how she was going to be able to campaign -- never mind hold office -- with a young baby. \"I mostly took that as people wanting to get to know me, and tried to stay positive. But of course I wanted to talked about the issues that made me run for office,\" Bender says. \"It did get a little frustrating. Obviously if a man was door knocking and his wife was pregnant no one would know, so he wouldn't have to answer those questions. On the other hand, it was an opportunity to educate people on, women do this kind of thing all the time, and elected officials and mothers do all kinds of amazing things while being mothers.\" As the summer went on, that response changed. People got to know Bender, and to follow her pregnancy. There was also something else: \"The more pregnant I got,\" Bender says, \"people saw how hard I was working, and their questions about, 'How are you going to be able to handle this?' went away.\" It was busy, and stressful at times. But the Benders had already been through a stressful pregnancy. \"We had already gone through surgery and chemo while I was pregnant, and taking care of a newborn while going through cancer treatment,\" Bender says. \"Compared to having cancer, it's really nothing we can't handle. The things that we're doing now, they're all good things.\" When she was born, baby Isabel weighed in at 9 pounds, 14 ounces. Now, Bender's taking a few days off to recover. After that, she'll go back to working the phones until November 5, this time with Isabel by her side.

PUBLISHED DATETIME: Wed Oct 31 2018 18:09:00 GMT+0000 (UTC) ## Global Power # Will Bolsonaro's victory in Brazil usher right-wing ripple effects in Latin America? \"Brazil now has the most right wing leader of any democracy in the world,\" says a political analyst. \"There is a real risk of contagion. \"Jair Bolsonaro, presidential candidate with the Social Liberal Party, waves after voting in the presidential runoff election in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Oct. 28, 2018.Silvia Izquierdo / AP ## Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBEOct. 31, 2018, 6:09 PM UTCBy Simeon Tegel LIMA, Perú — From the fate of the Amazon to LGBT rights and even the future of democracy itself, Jair Bolsonaro's historic victory in Brazil's presidential election could have profound repercussions across Latin America. With 209 million citizens, Brazil is easily the region's most populous nation and often wields an outsize influence among its neighbors in everything from soccer to social policies and international relations. The triumph of the hard right former army captain —with his lengthy track record of homophobic, misogynistic and racist remarks — as well as his unapologetic nostalgia for his country's 1964-1985 military dictatorship and support of torture, has many analysts wondering just where Latin America may now be headed. ## Why it matters that President Trump is praising Brazil's new president Oct. 30, 201803:59 Bolsonaro has pledged to open up the Amazon to mining and other activities that would threaten the world's largest tropical rain forest and a vast carbon sink that could play a vital role in tackling climate change. He has also threatened to kick left-wing political opponents out of the country and is a fierce participant in Brazil's culture wars, fervently opposing both abortion and same-sex marriage. \"Brazil now has the most right wing leader of any democracy in the world,\" says Dawisson Belém Lopes, a professor of international politics at Brazil's Minas Gerais Federal University. \"There is a real risk of contagion. When Lula [Brazil's former leftist president Luiz Inácio da Silva] was elected, it set the trend across Latin America that [Venezuela's late socialist leader Hugo] Chávez never could.\" Bolsonaro''s win comes after Brazilians' repudiation of the current government, which has been engulfed in massive corruption scandals. But voters may soon see stark changes; If Bolsonaro implements certain policy positions once in power, they would constitute a 180° turn on a range of issues. This could potentially give renewed momentum to like-minded politicians and interest groups across the region, from social conservatives to the agribusiness lobby that has often chafed at environmental laws aimed at preventing deforestation. ### Change toward Venezuela, China? Brazil's President-Elect could also usher in a sea change in regional attitudes towards Venezuela's economic and democratic collapse, forming a hard-line alliance with Colombia's new conservative president Iván Duque, who has also struck a more aggressive tone towards the Maduro regime and its so-called \"Bolivarian\" socialism. Another area where Bolsonaro could attempt to put Brazil on a new path is regarding its relationship with China, which has long been buying South American commodities, everything from soy to copper, to fuel its economic boom. #### Related NBC OUT ### NBC OUTLGBTQ Brazilians on edge after self-described 'homophobic' lawmaker elected president China has been Brazil's principal trading partner for a decade now and has increasingly displaced the United States' economic influence in the region. Bolsonaro has railed at what he views as Brazil's dependence on Beijing. \"The Bolsonaro administration could unleash a new wave of questioning, or pushing back, against China in the region,\" says Jason Marczak, director of the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a Washington D.C. think tank. But perhaps one of the biggest repercussions of Bolsonaro's victory in Latin America could be a new era of radical outsiders successfully running for the highest office. ### The triumph of outsiders — and fake news Bolsonaro has been dubbed the \"tropical Trump,\" yet there at least is one crucial difference between the two. While the U.S. President ran as the official Republican Party candidate, the Brazilian represented the tiny Social Liberal Party, with its minimalist party organization and negligible resources. His victory was in large part fueled by fake news that spread like wildfire over WhatsApp, which had 68% market penetration in Brazil in 2017. The smears spread this way against Fernando Haddad, Bolsonaro's opponent, which included unsubstantiated allegations of rape and of pushing homosexual indoctrination on six and seven-year-olds when he was education minister. Supporters of far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, celebrate in front of his house in Rio de Janeiro, after he won Brazil's presidential election, on Oct. 28, 2018Mauro Pimentel / AFP - Getty Images The proliferation of social media and instant messaging apps, married to voter outrage at the corruption of the political establishment, could mean that Bolsonaro is just the first of a wave of outsiders, with little or no respect for democratic institutions, taking office in Latin America. \"We so-called experts need to reconsider our understanding of politics, our understanding of what is possible,\" says Belém Lopes. #### Related ### NewsJair Bolsonaro's rivals bet Brazilians would unite against him. They were wrong. Yet not everyone is convinced that Bolsonaro really will be a regional trendsetter. His homophobic rhetoric has coincided with a reported rise in violent attacks on members of the LGBT community in Brazil, and his victory worried activists in the country. However, Leyla Huerta, a trans activist in Peru —which shares a 2000 mile-border with Brazil — is among those who view South America's largest nation, where Portuguese is spoken, as something of an island apart from its Spanish-speaking neighbors. \"Of course it is worrying,\" says Huerta. \"Any kind of backsliding on human rights is. But I am not sure that Brazil necessarily sets the agenda for the rest of us.\" Organizations will be monitoring Bolsonaro's government, but for now it's mostly wait and see. \"There have been tremendous strides in human rights and democracy in Latin America in the last couple of decades and it is critical that they are not reversed,\" said the Atlantic Council's Marczak. \"But we also need to be careful about assuming that Brazil's dynamics will apply in other contexts.\" Once Bolsonaro assumes office on January 1, Brazilians — and Latin Americans — will likely find out.

The Drama League nominations can look like something of a free-for-all, with four production categories that encompass an unlimited number of titles drawn from both Broadway and Off Broadway. The nominees list for the League's single acting award stretches to some 50 names, this year including Anne Hathaway (\"Grounded\"), Jessica Lange (\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\"), Lin-Manuel Miranda (\"Hamilton\"), Lupita Nyong'o (\"Eclipsed\"), Michelle Williams (\"Blackbird\") and Jesse Tyler Ferguson. ### Related 'American Psycho,' 'She Loves Me' Lead Outer Critics Circle Nominations With such an unusually crowded field of contenders, the Drama Leagues can't serve as much of a barometer for the theater world's overall awards season.

Courtesy of iStock Memorial Day weekend always makes me wonder why I don't live full time where everyone else vacations. The remote 'gig economy' has never been more accessible than it is today. 4G wireless covers 99% of America. Our laptops and phones run faster off the grid for longer. On the downside, the signal-everywhere, digital economy makes working 24/7 dangerously irresistible. On the upside, freelancers working remotely now comprise the fastest growing segment of the job market—which means it's more culturally permissible than ever to work from home overlooking the beach. Rented.com recently released its rankings of the \"The 150 Best Places To Buy A Vacation Rental Property In 2018\" in the U.S. There's a wealth of insight in here when it comes to hard costs and data like amortized return on investment, the relative burden of local taxes and regulations, and long-term cost of ownership vs. current rental rates. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge connects the \"low and slow\" bounty of Maryland's Eastern shore to Washington, D.C. and Baltimore in less than an hour Courtesy of Peter Lane Taylor My idea of the perfect vacation home has always rested of seven simpler, more emotional, and less data-driven principles: cool, historic architecture, one hour from an airport, three hours from the nearest big city, stretching my money, maximum proximity to every activity possible, hanging near rich people who own yachts and invest back into the community (and whose houses are far nicer than mine), and something has to be going on year round or I'll shrivel up and socially die. There are fewer of these places around than you might think. But they're out there. And they're calling your name: \"Buy me\", \"Work from home here now\". Despite some of the headlines recently, mortgage rates are still historically low. And summer's just begun. Hunt party setting out at dawn Courtesy of The Wright Group Thomasville, Georgia Unless you happen to love hunting Bobwhite quail, there's no reason you would have ever heard of Thomasville before. The locals know how to keep their secrets close to their vests. Thomasville lies in southwest Georgia in an area known as the Red Hills, a name that nods to the red clay soils and gently rolling pine and palm tree landscape that defines the area geographically. \"Thomasville's history plays an unmistakable role in why this small town is a thriving place today,\" says broker Ben McCollum of the Wright Group, which focuses on selling plantation, legacy properties. \"During the late 1800s, Thomasville was the end of the railway. Instead of Florida beaches, wealthy Northerners and Industrialists came south here to escape the cold and ultimately fell in love with the pine-infused air, mild climate, and sporting life. These Northern families bought land, established large winter estates and created sporting plantations, most of which are still privately owned and operated to this day. Thomasville is unique in the sense that a 6 oz. bird assists in driving the city culturally and economically today, and that was the same force that helped found the city.\" For a small town, there's plenty to do in Thomasville year-round. \"The downtown is charming with brick paved streets lined with elm trees and historic houses, tastemakers and trailblazers alike, all in walking distance of one another,\" McCollum continues. \"The culinary scene has also put Thomasville on the Southern food map, and local store owners have curated special spaces that are inviting, creative and distinct. There are annual festivals throughout the year that revolve around the sporting life, historic preservation, and the arts, with a long peak season that runs from October - May.\" For many second homebuyers here, some of whom come from America's wealthiest families, acreage is the priority; it translates into wildlife habitat and privacy. But the other main feature people come here for is the proximity to Florida's panhandle beaches, which are less than 90 minutes away and some of the most remote and unspoiled in the country. \"There's another group of buyers here who are driven by Thomasville's downtown architecture,\" says McCollum. \"They want to refurbish a home in one of the historic districts. They fall in love with downtown and want a restored storefront condominium for $300,000. They want to drive to the beach for the day instead of maintaining a large estate. Thomasville is special in this sense that it can offer a smaller, safe, affordable city life and quiet country living at the same time, and the two notions mix here really well. We're like Charleston, Savannah, or New Orleans. But at a fraction of the price, making us one of the best-kept secrets in the South. Just don't tell anyone!\" Palm Springs, California Mid-Century architecture. Photo by Martyn Goddard/Corbis via Getty Images Palm Springs, California When most people think of Palm Springs one of three things typically comes to mind: pretentious actors, too many golf courses, and stifling desert heat. All of those things are true to a minor extent depending on the time of year. Palm Springs is also one of the coolest, affordable destinations in America if you have any love at all for the outdoors, National Parks, hot springs, art galleries, film festivals, a world-class foodie scene, polo, hot air balloons, and some of the best preserved modernist architecture in the country. Palm Springs isn't so much a city as it is a valley of towns, gouged out of the desert in a broad southeast to northwest swath that's walled in to the south by the San Jacinto mountains and Joshua Tree National Park to the north. Los Angeles is three hours west, Las Vegas three hours east. Palm Springs' own airport could land Air Force One (it has) so its proximity to everywhere has always been one of the big sells. The valley also is home to some of the hottest and most therapeutic hot springs mineral water in North America. Mount San Jacinto, which towers 10,700 vertical feet above the valley floor is the highest dead rise of any mountain in the continental U.S. There's a European-designed rotating tram that runs to the top putting hundreds of miles of wilderness hiking trails at your fingertips without ever even having to hike uphill. If you have the urge to carve a few turns on the ski slopes before you soak in the hot springs, Big Bear is three hours north. When it's time to buy, keep an eye on your real estate taxes, condo, and \"resort\" fees, which can vary wildly neighborhood by neighborhood and depending on whether the home is in a development or not. Prices, especially for condos, still haven't quite recovered since the Recession so $250,000 - $350,000 will comfortably get you two-bedrooms and 1800 SF of mountain views. Livingston, Montana Livingston is one of those few western mountain towns left that hasn't given up its soul and architectural character while still catering to the private jet crowd that shacks up in the 10,000 SF, 100-acre ranches outside of town. Livingston's downtown is just north of Yellowstone National Park and sits on the banks of the Yellowstone River along Lewis And Clark's epic route across America. The Yellowstone is the longest free flowing river left in the U.S. and widely regarded as one of the top trout fishing rivers on the planet. The hiking, biking, mountain climbing, skiing, hunting, and horseback riding nearby rivals anything in the West. At night, Livingston's historic downtown—fronted with the perfectly-preserved facades of the original brick and timber storefronts dating back to the late 1880s—comes alive with street art, wildlife galleries, boutiques, an up and coming farm-to-table scene, local bands playing local bars, and an eclectic mix of old timers and new locals that always keeps the place lively. For new pioneers looking to build their dream home you can still snatch up 3-5 acre lots with mountain views for $100,000 outside of town. You can own a 4-bedroom Victorian piece of Livingston history with original millwork and architectural details and walk to dinner for $350,000. You can also walk to fish in the Yellowstone the next morning. The fall \"Supermoon\" rises over the Chesapeake Bay west of Easton, Maryland Courtesy of Peter Lane Taylor Easton, Maryland If you live in Washington, D.C., this historic town of 15,000 people on Maryland's Eastern Shore across the Bay Bridge from Annapolis is no secret. Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheyney own waterfront estates not far out of town, along with dozens of other members of D.C.'s politico-corporate elite. There are five key selling points to Easton: crazy low property taxes, year round culture, a farm-to-table foodie scene that gets better every year, water everywhere, and a level of celebrity discretion that's on par with the Hamptons. \"It's the pace and natural beauty of the Eastern Shore that draws people here, including the D.C. elite,\" says local realtor Kathleen Coale of Long & Foster whose mother-in-law is political broadcaster and journalist Greta Van Susteren. \"We have over 600 miles of gorgeous Chesapeake Bay waterfront. The towns of Easton and St. Michaels offer amazing restaurants, boutique shopping, art galleries, and museums that you won't find anywhere else an hour away from a major city. I'm biased. But Easton and Talbot County have everything the Hamptons have without the drawbacks. We're only a few hours from Philly, New York and New Jersey where home prices and taxes are soaring. Our proximity to three major airports (two in D.C. and BWI in Baltimore) as well as Easton Airport make us convenient for travelers who are flying in from around the country.\" Notwithstanding the long gated driveways, Gulfstream Vs parked at the Easton airport, and the better than 50% odds that the woman sitting behind you at dinner is a UN ambassador, getting a piece of Easton's action doesn't require a security clearance. (Easton recently ranked 8thon Kiplinger's list of 20 Small Towns With Big Millionaire Populations). $250,000 buys you a carefully, re-crafted renovation in town. If you're willing to stake your claim 20 minutes outside of Easton, St. Michaels, and Oxford, you can still find affordable waterfront as well. Though it probably won't be next door to Rumsfeld and Cheyney. \"Donald Rumsfeld celebrated the publication of his new book in our restaurant years ago,\" says Alice Lloyd, who co-owns the Bartlett Pear Inn with her chef-husband Jordan Lloyd. \"Dick Cheney ate a hanger steak with fries and béarnaise while enjoying a peaceful date with his lovely wife not too long ago. Countless other local politicians have dined with us over the years. That's just how it is here. Essex, New York Essex is a tiny lakefront hamlet flanked in by Lake Champlain (America's \"6th Great Lake\") and Vermont's Green Mountains to the east and the largest, roadless protected wilderness area east of the Mississippi to the west, New York's Adirondack State Park. There's nothing about it in particular that makes it famous (except a few of the residents' last names, like Pataki). Some places are simply blessed by geography. \"People love Essex because it's on Lake Champlain between Vermont and the High Peaks. And it's much quieter and less developed on the New York side,\" real estate broker Lauren Murphy tells me. \"It's like stepping back in time here. Not only is this place beautiful at every time of year, but our location provides proximity to everything for outdoor enthusiasts and families like hiking, biking, sailing, kayaking, and skiing.\" Essex was an early 19th century shipping port, and a bustling lakeside village in its early years, surrounded by large farms and forests. Most of the historic architecture you see today was built during this period (Essex is on the National Register of Historic Places). Today's residents full and part time have maintained a strong preservation ethic, both in architectural and land conservation, and it shows in the tidy homes, village streets, and old farmhouse estates that fan out up from the lake. \"Essex has a large summer population,\" Murphy continues, \"With most people either having a camp on or near the lakeshore or a second home in the village. People have been coming here to summer since around 1900, including to the Crater Club south of Essex village along the lake that was founded in 1899. There are a lot of families who have history here, and they've been coming back for generations.\" If you can find Essex on Google Earth it's close to nothing—which is part of the town's allure. But it's less than 90 minutes from Montreal, an hour from Burlington, Vermont and a four hour drive from New York City. On the outdoor front, it's 45 minutes from Lake Placid, home to the 1980 Olympics and Whiteface Mountain, and an hour and change (depending on how well you time the ferry ride across the lake) from Vermont's famed ski resorts like Stowe and Killington.

Photo: Victor Blackman / Express / Getty Images The cast of 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum'. Photo: Victor Blackman / Express / Getty Images Say what you will about Theresa May — and you can say plenty — no-one has ever accused her of being over-freighted with emotional intelligence. This has been obvious for a long time now but is a problem that, while insurmountable, has steadily grown in importance. She is hardly alone in this, of course, but it ill-behoves the leader of a country more or less divided in half to act as though she has a monopoly on wisdom or virtue. The same, of course, could be said of some of her opponents. Newly-radicalised Remainers, for instance, are prone to thinking the very worst of all Leavers, forgetting that their own enthusiasm for Remaining part of the EU was, way back in 2016, often heavily-qualified and flecked with an understanding that the EU was at best an imperfect set of institutions that often behaved stupidly and sometimes even worse than that. Many Remain votes were cast with little enthusiasm and plenty of ambivalence. Referendums push people to extremes, however, and so the EU has been reimagined as the last, vital, bulwark against everything that's hellish or reactionary in modern Britain. Just as the Leave campaign was built on plenty of myths — and some of them pernicious ones at that — so, in response, the rump Remain movement has constructed matching myths of its own. Perhaps chief of these is the suggestion that Brexit has unleashed everyone's Little Englander; every bridge is a drawbridge and every gate a portcullis. No matter what Leave campaigners may say now, immigration was central to their victory. I see no point in them denying this for the record is plain even if it now suits them to pretend otherwise. And yet since then something startling has happened: the salience of immigration as an issue has plummeted. Before the referendum, nearly half of all voters (45 percent) named immigration one of the most serious issues facing Britain; now fewer than one in five voters tell IpsosMORI migration is that important. This is the lowest figure since 2001. From which we may hazard that if Leave voters were — as some Remainers believe — driven by xenophobic obsession in 2016 they have, or at least many of them have, shed that xenophobia in 2019. Other surveys of opinion confirm that, contrary to what is often assumed, attitudes towards immigration have softened considerably since the referendum. Moreover, although coming from a lower base of approval, Leave voters' beliefs around immigration have softened at much the same rate as Remainers' views. Furthermore, it is well-established that voters are capable of holding more than one view at a time and are happy to do so even if, in sum, these views approach the point at which they begin to contradict each other. Hence, when asked about their personal experiences or even their local communities, voters are significantly more likely to view the contribution of immigrants positively even as they worry it might have an overall negative impact on the country. None of this is to say immigrants from EU countries have no reason for feeling anxious. Many plainly feel the wind has changed and now blows from a chillier point of the compass. And, as a matter of psychology, one may understand — and sympathise — that Brexit must have felt like a rather personal repudiation to many EU citizens residing in the UK. Equally, the implied logic of the Leave campaign was not just that future immigration was bad but also that there had been too much of it in the recent past. Again, however, the difference between the personal and the general matters. Even on the latter front, there has been no great popular campaign to remove EU citizens or even make their lives more difficult. Which, typically, makes you wonder why the government has done its best to do exactly that. I suspect this owes something to the narrowness of Theresa May's thinking; having interpreted the referendum as something close to a single-issue plebiscite in which the meaning of Brexit could only be satisfied by ending free movement (thereby significantly complicating her options) she lacked the empathy needed to see that EU citizens here now needed reassurance, not the sense they were being used as chips in a high-stakes political game. Even stupidity is not guaranteed to last forever, though. So it is welcome that the government has decided not to make EU citizens pay £65 for the pleasure of registering their residence in this country. This was a penny-wise pound foolish policy anyway that could earn the government nothing but grief. As such it was a typically fat-headed, tin-eared, policy in the first place and a reminder that this government has an unusual thirst for self-inflicted pain. So much so, indeed, that sometimes it is easy to think absurdities are pursued chiefly to provide the grounds for subsequent retreat and humiliation. # Get more from CapX Follow us on Twitter Join us on Facebook Sign up to our email bulletins Subscribe to Free Exchange, the CapX podcast Still, despite it all it seems important, I think, to draw a distinction between official policy and the way life is actually lived. The Home Office often appears and sometimes is — as the Windrush scandal confirmed — sociopathic but that does not a nation of sociopaths make. Consider some other recent developments. The death of the actor Windsor Davies spawned a predictable flurry of nostalgia for the way things used to be. His role in It Ain't Half Hot Mum — a situation comedy focused on the misadventures of a troupe of army musicians in India at the end of the Second World War — was fondly recalled with there being much talk of how they just don't make 'em like that any more and, of course, the BBC would never dare to show IAHHM ever again, not with all the political correctness gone mad and all the rest of it, you know. Well, indeed they would not. More than most mediums, television dates quickly and comedy often has a shorter half-life than other genres. To say IAHHM was \"of its time\" is both obvious and generous and an implicit acknowledgement that such a show would not, indeed could not, be made today. Or, at any rate, would have to be made differently. Throughout almost the entire history of British — and especially English — comedy it is axiomatic that foreigners are intrinsically funny. They cannot help it, the poor souls. Even so, it is striking how 1970s comedy now seems something close to obsessed with issues of race and sexuality. Homosexuals — poofs, in the parlance of the time — are both absurd and terrifying; so too, and perhaps even more so, are black men. In truth, even when judged by modern standards IAHHM was a relatively minor offender when compared with programmes such as Mind Your Language, Love Thy Neighbour and Curry and Chips. Look them up on YouTube and see what I mean. These are shows from a different world and, if we are interested in being honest, a much narrower, nastier, one. Doubtless future generations will gawp in amazement at some of the cruelties of our own time but we in turn are able, indeed required, to note the extent to which what was deemed funny 40 years ago is not so very clever or funny now. If television is, in part, a window onto society, Britain has changed immeasurably and immeasurably for the better since a time when racial prejudice — often overt, not even \"casual\" — could be played for laughs on primetime. Nor was this something limited to situation comedy as the experiences of black footballers in the 1970s and early-to-mid 1980s demonstrated. That too seems to belong to a different era. None of which is to say that Britain is always as relaxed or liberal a polity as relaxed liberals would like to believe it. Merely that, for all of everything and for all that we are more aware now of subliminal prejudice or bias, the experience of Britain enjoyed by black, Asian and other ethnic minority citizens has been transformed. If that journey is not yet complete — and in some instances far from complete — it remains important to note how much of it has still been made. Not enough, perhaps, but far from nothing either. I do not mean to be Panglossian about these matters. Not everything is for the best and this is not always the best of all possible worlds. Even so, the outrage caused by shortcomings — to put it kindly — in the system is as notable as the shortcomings itself and a reminder that caricatures of Britain, whether offered by Leavers or Remainers, have only a limited usefulness and purchase. That does not justify governmental heavy-handedness and stupidity but nor should a villainous bureaucracy be taken to speak for the people as a whole. The current political climate, however, encourages almost everyone to think the very worst of people with whom they happen to have political disagreements. So be it; some of these arguments are both important and necessary. But they do not reveal the whole story or the entire picture. If we have learned anything these past three years, it might be the usefulness of allowing for good faith disagreement and the desirability of a political culture that pays some attention to the importance and power of generosity. If the government too often fails in this regard that is no reason for citizens to do likewise.

During the 54-hour general strike on 23 July, some protesters threw stones at police while attacking the headquarters of Ershad's political party, Jatiyo, in Dhaka's main business district. Repressive Violence: Throughout the entire campaign, Ershad used repressive action to try and shut down action against his regime. In November 1987 and November 1990, Ershad declared a state of emergency and relied on martial law to justify his actions in arresting top leaders of opposition groups, conducting mass arrests of protesters who continued to participate in strikes/demonstrations, having police fire on protesters, and making any anti-Ershad regime action punishable by the threat of imprisonment. Success Outcome Success in achieving specific demands/goals: 6 points out of 6 points Survival: 1 point out of 1 points Growth: 3 points out of 3 points Total points: 10 out of 10 points After becoming independent from Pakistan in 1971, Bangladesh had a long history of military rule. Its first two leaders, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman were both assassinated in military coups and their regimes were followed by military dictatorships. The two main Bangladeshi political parties, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) were formed by these two leaders and later led by their daughter and widow respectively – Hasina Wajed and Khaleda Zia. In 1982, General Hussain Muhammed Ershad seized power in Bangladesh during a bloodless coup. Upon taking power, Ershad became the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA), suspended the 1972 constitution, and banned all political parties. However, in 1983, he assumed the presidency and by January 1986, he had restored full political activity in which his own party, the Jatiya (People's) Party took a prominent part. While Ershad was proclaimed the winner in a presidential election held in October 1986 under martial law, Bangladesh's opposition parties challenged the legitimacy of Ershad's regime. Opposition parties like the AL had participated in the 1986 parliamentary elections and believed they had won, but the vote count was suspended for several days before eventually giving Ershad's Jatiya Party a majority in Parliament. Despite the refusal of opposition parties to recognize the legitimacy of the Ershad regime, Ershad refused to step down. Starting in 1987, opposition groups organized mass demonstrations to demand Ershad's removal from the presidency. Opposition groups became mobilized after Ershad's introduction of the controversial District Council Bill in parliament that would allow military officers to serve on local district councils. Consequently, in June 1987, opposition parties formed an alliance to implement a half-day general strike in Dhaka on 23 June 1987. Opposition parties organized and executed another half-day general strike in Dhaka the following week on 30 June that paralyzed most of Bangladesh's major cities and towns. However, despite these efforts, Ershad's Jatiyo Party majority in Parliament went on to pass the District Council Bill on 12 July 1987. In response, opposition groups struck and publically demonstrated two days after the bill's passage, causing Ershad to send the bill back to Parliament to be reconsidered. Opposition groups intensified street demonstrations and became more closely unified, deciding to work together to call for Ershad's immediate resignation and new elections under a caretaker government. On 23 July 1987, opposition groups planned mass public demonstrations in Dhaka, Chittagong, and Khulna. Following Ershad's orders, police fired on participating protesters, resulting in civilian casualties, and police arrested as many as 500 protesters across the country. On the morning of 24 July, mourners of protesters who had died marched through the streets of Dhaka to the Baitul Mukurram Mosque. While mourning marches in Bangladesh are usually held in silence, many in the procession shouted, \"Down with President Ershad!\" and \"The killers shall be punished!\" On the same day, the Workers-Employees United Council began a 54-hour general strike in Dhaka calling for Ershad's resignation – the longest general strike in Bangladesh's history. Thousands participated, and while the leadership had emphasized the nonviolent nature of the strike, the action was marred by violence as clashes occurred between protesters and police when police fired on stone-throwing mobs that attacked the headquarters of Jatiyo in Dhaka's central business district. Police also fired rounds of tear gas shells to disperse crowds of protesters. By the fall of 1987, opposition groups had continued to coordinate efforts to put more pressure on the Ershad regime. On 28 October, Hasina and Khaleda Zia met – signaling a new phase of cooperation between the two leading opposition parties, the AL and BNP. Opposition groups planned a series of events that would begin 10 November, naming the action the \"Siege of Dhaka\". Groups planned to bring thousands of their supporters to the streets to paralyze the capital city and heighten confrontation against Ershad. However, Ershad took action to defuse the situation and forestall the opposition's plan to start a 72-hour strike on 29 November by declaring a state of emergency on 27 November 1987. Under the state of emergency, Ershad arrested Hasina, Khaleda Zia, and other main opposition leaders while sending thousands of police forces into Bangladesh's main urban areas to clamp down on protesters. In Dhaka, Ershad imposed a 30-hour curfew at midnight on 27 November and sent helmeted riot police and paramilitary forces to surround the capital. Additionally, Ershad ordered the suspension of all fundamental rights of Bangladeshi citizens, barred courts from trying any cases related to the violation of citizens' rights, banned publication of any news or commentary against the government. Anyone who violated the orders under the state of emergency could be jailed up to three years and fined. Ershad publicly rejected the opposition's call for his resignation, stating his intention to serve the remaining years of the term he won in the 1986 elections. At this point, while civil disobedience had rattled the Ershad regime, it had not been enough to bring the regime down. While what remained of the opposition attempted to regroup and tried to organize in 1988 and 1989, they faced continuous, intense repression by the Ershad regime and were plagued by internal divisions. However, the events of the fall of 1990 marked a turning point for the opposition. Opposition groups had reorganized and were closely unified in their efforts to achieve the common goal of bringing the Ershad regime down. Additionally, opposition groups now consisted of diverse segments of the Bangladeshi population including not only workers, but also doctors, lawyers, and intellectuals. Opposition groups organized a small number of public demonstrations on 10 October 1990. In response, on 17 October the government closed universities and main schools but this only served to galvanize university students as one of the driving force of protest against the regime and the students put pressure on the traditionally divided opposition parties to continue maintaining a united front against Ershad. After weeks of strikes and public demonstrations that paralyzed Dhaka and other major urban areas of Bangladesh, Ershad declared another state of emergency on 28 November 1990. Ershad suspended consideration of all civil rights and imposed an indefinite curfew on Dhaka. On 30 November, police officers fired on protesters who continued to participate in public demonstrations in Dhaka. However, strikes and public demonstrations continued despite the imposition of martial law under the state of emergency. On 3 December 1990, President Ershad publically stated his willingness to make concessions with the opposition as he was rapidly losing control of Dhaka and other major cities in Bangladesh. Bangladesh's educated classes had began to play a key role in the anti-Ershad movement as teachers, journalists, and doctors went on strike – further paralyzing activity in Bangladesh. On 4 December the opposition rejected Ershad's proposal. 100,000 people marched in the streets of Dhaka to demand the President's immediate resignation. In a sign of Ershad's weakening base of support, the Bangladeshi police began to refuse to comply with Ershad's order to fire on demonstrators. Ershad agreed to step down on 4 December. After Ershad was removed from power, a three-month neutral transitional government headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Shahabuddin Ahmed, declared a state of emergency, restored civil liberties, and was responsible for organizing elections on 27 February 1991. The ensuing 1991 election was the first democratic election ever held in the country, and while 73 parties participated, the AL and BNP dominated – marking the beginning of a persistent two-party system in Bangladesh. The elections ultimately resulted in a BNP government, and Khaleda Zia was sworn in as Bangladesh's prime minister. However, since elections were held in 1991, political contests between the AL and BNP have been mainly fueled by personal rivalry between the parties' leaders instead of being issue-oriented. Bangladesh's winner-take-all politics have now produced a recurring pattern where the ruling party refuses a meaningful role for the opposition, the opposition walks out, and society is paralyzed by strikes and boycotts. To date, Bangladesh's electoral system has been unable to resolve the tensions produced by this constant rivalry.

Simulate the entire world Kathryn Nave 12 Jan 2016 Kathryn Nave Tuesday 12 January 2016 This article was taken from The WIRED World in 2016 -- our fourth annual trends report, a standalone magazine in which our network of expert writers and influencers predicts what's coming next. Be the first to read WIRED's articles in print before they're posted online, and get your hands on loads of additional content by subscribing online. For all the legions of programmers coding the movement of individual blades of grass, and all the advances in processing power and VR, the simulated worlds of online gaming still behave nothing like the real one. It's not just the proliferation of enchanted objects and implausible weaponry. It's something more fundamental. \"Say I drop an object on the floor. I leave the room and come back. In 99 percent off MMOs [massively multiplayer online games], it's just vanished without explanation,\" says Herman Narula, founder and CEO of London-based virtual-world-simulation startup Improbable. \"How can I tell a story? How can I do anything meaningful in a world like that?\" Founded in 2012, Improbable's mission to create a platform upon which developers can build vastly more complex worlds, sprung from Narula's frustration at running up against the limitations of online games. \"We read books and we cry, we laugh, we're horrified, we fall in love -- those experiences matter to people. Online worlds need to evoke the same thing,\" he says. \"In the last few years we've seen the abysmal failure of games attempting to mimic the World of Warcraft model of repeating scripted content. The average gamer age is 37, the industry is worth a hundred billion dollars, and people are hungry for deeper experiences. They want their actions to make a difference.\" For that you need something more than a player-centric illusion. You need a world with a complex system of physical laws that allows a person's actions to have significant, lasting consequences. An environment where, if a mine explosion occurs in one area, players in a town far downstream will see debris floating in their part of the river. In turn, the ruins will rust and decay even when no player is present. A world in which if you kill a dragon, it stays dead, rather than re-incarnating for the next player. A world, in short, where things stay where you put them. #### Read next The future of online retail is collaboration ### The future of online retail is collaboration We read books and we cry, we laugh, we're horrified, we fall in love -- those experiences matter to people. Online worlds need to evoke the same thing This is what Improbable's technology claims to allow. The key, says Narula, is distribution. The standard online games model is a single server per game, meaning the number of simulated entities and players is limited by the capacity of that server. To handle huge numbers of simultaneous players the developer can run multiple versions of their game, each on a separate server, with players divided up between them. \"Say you want to make a world in which a thousand people can fight together in real-time in one location,\" Narula says. \"A single server can't deal with that. To make it work you end up limiting the game in other ways.\" Improbable swaps those separated servers for a scalable swarm of simpler, lightweight machines that co-operate to co-simulate the world, swapping work between them to meet areas of higher demand. \"Say there's a huge firefight in one location, maybe 20 workers are involved in simulating that. A millisecond later, that firefight ends, everyone's dead, those machines vanish and that piece of the world is taken over by just one,\" Narula says. \"We're talking about live processes jumping between servers in the middle of a calculation. That's never been done before.\" It's a bold claim with an impressive team behind it, including former Google Hangouts SRE engineering manager Sam Kalnins and former general manager of triple A games studio Crytek, Nick Button-Brown, along with software engineers from eBay, Amazon and Goldman Sachs. In March 2015, the founders convinced blue-chip VCs Andreessen Horowitz, an early backer of the Oculus Rift, to invest $20 million (£13m). The same month, Dean Hall, creator of the enormously popular open world survival game DayZ announced he was working with Improbable on a project, later revealed as space colonisation game, Ion, describing it as \"The most exhilarating thing I have ever done.\" The first public demonstration will come early in 2016 with the official launch of the first game to be built on the platform: made by London-based Bossa Studios, Worlds Adrift will be a massive multiplayer game in which players work together to construct airships from discovered resources and explore a world of floating islands. \"We had the idea for Worlds Adrift long before meeting Improbable, but shelved it as impossible for a team our size,\" explains Bossa Studio's co-founder and gamer-in-chief Henrique Olifiers. \"The complexity of even just an ordinary MMO means that what would be a trivial single-player problem becomes exponentially more difficult. You need at least a hundred people to pull that off.\" #### Read next Technology is making it easier to trust strangers ### Technology is making it easier to trust strangers Every activity, whether its chopping down a tree or digging a hole, is unpredictable because these all involve multiple individual entities subject to complex laws, just as in the real world Yet within just two months of picking up Improbable's platform, Bossa's 30-person team had a beta not just for a standard MMO, but one that showed signs of realising Improbable's claims of complex physics and radical persistence. \"Every activity, whether its chopping down a tree or digging a hole, is unpredictable because these all involve multiple individual entities subject to complex laws, just as in the real world,\" Olifiers says. \"Even if you perform the same action the consequences can be different, and players can create different ways to go about any one challenge.\" This means that rather than gameplay being dependent on various scripted missions and events, the situations players encounter emerge from the interactions of other players and the world's inbuilt laws. Much of this has, to some extent, been done before. But a game that can handle both the complex physics of innumerable simulated entities and the demands of thousands of players, all in real time, is something new. Perhaps the closest example, Narula suggests, is the space-exploration game EVE Online -- a title in which the results of emergent gameplay extend to complex business alliances, high-level corporate espionage and, last year, a 4,000-player firefight resulting in more than $300,000 worth of damage to 75 spaceships. Yet, unlike in the Improbable vision, the wreckage of this almighty battle had to be hand-designed by EVE's developers and inserted into the game days later. Improbable's software is also drawing interest from those looking to simulate something more realistic than intergalactic warfare. \"We're talking to people across defence, economics and biology,\" Narula says. \"Researchers who want to build models of things like the world's fish population, or a mirror of London which updates in real time, allowing you to ask questions such as, 'What if this piece of infrastructure were to shut down?'\" Researchers including David Pugh at the University of Oxford's Institute for New Economic Thinking are looking to use Improbable's platform to build a model of the UK housing market. \"Each household has a huge range of varying characteristics to it: income, wealth, composition. To represent that accurately, you need a massive model with complex agents, which has been a problem,\" he explains. \"Previous platforms just don't scale in the way that Improbable's technology has the potential to.\" That scalability could eventually encompass other countries' housing markets and even the operations of the wider financial system, allowing Pugh's team to better understand how mortgages are funded and produce insights that could influence the policy of government agencies. \"We imagined this would be a narrow thing that only helped gaming,\" says Narula. \"But we began to realise that it was a much more fundamental solution. It's not just something that online games need, it's a better way of handling all distributed computing.

Although in use for the many official events and receptions held by The Queen, the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace are open to visitors every summer. Buckingham Palace has 775 rooms. These include 19 State rooms, 52 Royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms. In measurements, the building is 108 metres long across the front, 120 metres deep (including the central quadrangle) and 24 metres high. ## Buckingham Palace today Today, Buckingham Palace is very much a working building and the centrepiece of the UK's constitutional monarchy, serving as the venue for many royal events and ceremonies from entertaining foreign Head of States to celebrating achievement at Investitures and receptions. More than 50,000 people visit the Palace each year as guests to State banquets, lunches, dinners, receptions and Garden Parties. Her Majesty also holds weekly audiences with the Prime Minister and receives newly-appointed foreign Ambassadors at Buckingham Palace. Receptions are held at the Palace throughout the year to recognise the work of industry, government, charities, sport, the Commonwealth and many more areas of life. For example, in 2013 The Queen hosted a reception to celebrate the Commonwealth, Youth and Education, which was attended by 350 guests from academic institutions around the world and included a performance by the Commonwealth Youth Orchestra and choir and more recently, in 2015, Her Majesty hosted a reception for players, organisers and supporters of the Rugby World Cup. Buckingham Palace is often a focal point for significant national celebrations and commemorations. In 2002, a music concert was staged in the garden of Buckingham Palace to mark The Queen's Golden Jubilee, which included a unforgettable performance of 'God Save The Queen' by Brian May from the roof of the Palace and at Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 members of the public were invited to have a special picnic in the Buckingham Palace garden. The balcony of Buckingham Palace is one of the most famous in the world. The first recorded Royal balcony appearance took place in 1851, when Queen Victoria stepped onto it during celebrations for the opening of the Great Exhibition. Since then, Royal Balcony appearances have marked many occasions from The Queen's annual official birthday celebrations to watch the RAF Flypast at the end of Trooping the Colour, Royal Weddings, as well as special events of national significance such as the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Whilst Buckingham Palace is seen as the administrative hub of the Monarchy, it is also very much a family home, in addition to holding The Queen's Gallery and the Royal Mews. The Queen gave birth to Prince Charles and Prince Andrew at the Palace, and to this day notice of royal births and deaths are still attached to the front railings for members of the public to read. The christenings of The Prince of Wales, The Princess Royal, The Duke of York and Prince William took place in the Music Room and many Royal Weddings have been celebrated at Buckingham Palace, most recently The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's. The offices of those who support the day-to-day activities and duties of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh and their immediate family, such as the Private Secretary's Office and the Privy Purse and Treasurer's Office are located at Buckingham Palace. ## History of Buckingham Palace George III bought Buckingham House in 1761 for his wife Queen Charlotte to use as a comfortable family home close to St James's Palace, where many court functions were held. Buckingham House became known as the Queen's House, and 14 of George III's 15 children were born there. George IV, on his accession in 1820, decided to reconstruct the house into a pied-à-terre, using it for the same purpose as his father George III. As work progressed, and as late as the end of 1826, The King had a change of heart. With the assistance of his architect, John Nash, he set about transforming the house into a palace. Parliament agreed to a budget of £150,000, but the King pressed for £450,000 as a more realistic figure. Nash retained the main block but doubled its size by adding a new suite of rooms on the garden side facing west. Faced with mellow Bath stone, the external style reflected the French neo-classical influence favoured by George IV. The remodelled rooms are the State and semi-State Rooms, which remain virtually unchanged since Nash's time. The north and south wings of Buckingham House were demolished and rebuilt on a larger scale with a triumphal arch - the Marble Arch - as the centrepiece of an enlarged courtyard, to commemorate the British victories at Trafalgar and Waterloo. By 1829 the costs had escalated to nearly half a million pounds. Nash's extravagance cost him his job, and on the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother William IV took on Edward Blore to finish the work. The King never moved into the Palace. Indeed, when the Houses of Parliament were destroyed by fire in 1834, the King offered the Palace as a new home for Parliament, but the offer was declined. Queen Victoria was the first sovereign to take up residence in July 1837 and in June 1838 she was the first British sovereign to leave from Buckingham Palace for a Coronation. Her marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 soon showed up the Palace's shortcomings. A serious problem for the newly married couple was the absence of any nurseries and too few bedrooms for visitors. The only solution was to move the Marble Arch - it now stands at the north-east corner of Hyde Park - and build a fourth wing, thereby creating a quadrangle. The cost of the new wing was largely covered by the sale of George IV's Royal Pavilion at Brighton. Blore added an attic floor to the main block of the Palace and decorated it externally with marble friezes originally intended for Nash's Marble Arch. The work was completed in 1847.By the turn of the century the soft French stone used in Blore's East Front was showing signs of deterioration, largely due to London's notorious soot, and required replacing. In 1913 the decision was taken to reface the façade. Sir Aston Webb, with a number of large public buildings to his credit, was commissioned to create a new design. Webb chose Portland Stone, which took 12 months to prepare before building work could begin. When work did start it took 13 weeks to complete the refacing, a process that included removing the old stonework. The present forecourt of the Palace, where Changing the Guard takes place, was formed in 1911, as part of the Victoria Memorial scheme. The gates and railings were also completed in 1911; the North-Centre Gate is now the everyday entrance to the Palace, whilst the Central Gate is used for State occasions and the departure of the guard after Changing the Guard. The work was completed just before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. ## Visiting Buckingham Palace Buckingham Palace is open to the public during the summer months and for a limited number of tours in December, January and at Easter each year.

He spent the entire 2015 training camp with the Broncos before being released during final cuts on September 5. Carter has played in 42 career regular season games (three starts) and five playoff contests with Denver and the New England Patriots. He has totaled 42 tackles (37 solo), 22 passes defensed, three interceptions, three fumble recoveries and six special teams tackles. In 2014, Carter played in eight regular season games for the Broncos and registered five solo tackles, one pass defensed and one fumble recovery. He saw action in 12 games (two starts) in 2013 and tallied 11 tackles (10 solo), eight passes defensed, one interception and two special teams tackles. Carter appeared in two playoff contests and made five tackles (four solo) and two passes defensed. In 2012, he set career highs in every category as he collected 24 tackles, 12 passes defensed, two interceptions, one fumble recovery and two defensive touchdowns (one fumble return, one interception return) in 15 games. His 12 passes defensed were the most by a non-starter in the NFL. Carter played in one postseason game and made one special teams tackle.

Henrietta Norton Amid this week's official celebrations her name was barely mentioned. But ordinary people know what she did Contact author Thu 12 Apr 2018 10.40 EDT Last modified on Fri 13 Apr 2018 06.08 EDT Mo Mowlam with soldiers from the Royal Irish guards in Belfast, 1998. 'When she arrived as Northern Ireland secretary in 1997, the job was reputed to be a 'poisoned chalice'.' Photograph: Max Nash/AP As I watched the 20-year celebrations of the Good Friday agreement play out, my frustration and anger began to boil over. \"Where the fuck is she?\" I wanted to shout at the television and radio. As the day went on I decided to just avoid the media altogether; it was only going to make me cross, and that's not what the day was about. It was a day to celebrate something extraordinary, the impossible becoming possible. Mo Mowlam was my stepmum, but for most people she is remembered for the work she did helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland. When Mo arrived as Northern Ireland secretary in 1997, the job was reputed to be a \"poisoned chalice\". However, Mo not only brought the opposing parties to the table but also helped persuade a country of divided communities to come together for the sake of peace and progress. ## What's the ​best way to get written out of history? Be a middle-aged woman | Zoe Williams Read more I missed Mo more this week than I do on the anniversary of her death, or her birthday. Her absence was everywhere in the British media's coverage of the anniversary of the agreement. I felt powerless as I watched the old guard being paraded across our screens. In their defence, Mo can't be there of course. She died from cancer back in 2005. On Tuesday, Tony Blair gave his speech in Belfast on the anniversary of the agreement signing. It was a stark oversight that he didn't even mention her name. He made no acknowledgment of her role in the negotiations at all. Perhaps he was afraid that he might get another standing ovation about someone else in the middle of one of his speeches? I would go so far as to say that without Mo there would be no peace process in Northern Ireland. She applied her own distinctive personality and approach to the job. She demonstrated empathy and understanding. She recognised and listened to victims and survivors. She worked closely with the men but also very importantly the women – mothers, daughters, girlfriends and wives – of Northern Ireland in order to achieve peace. Mo was from a family of strong women; her father was an alcoholic which meant her mother and older sister held her family together. Her inclusion of women was imperative to the peace process – she knew that without help from the women in the community, there was no way she was going to be able to persuade the men to join the conversation. She had to find the humanity in and commonality between families and relationships from all sides, in order to help people find hope. Some have argued that Mo was not able to actually \"seal the deal\" in the end, and that things began to unravel on her watch. Or that there's a \"myth of Mo\" and her role in the peace process. In 2005 when Mo died, Blair said of her: \"It is no exaggeration to say she transformed the politics not just of Northern Ireland itself but crucially of relations between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, and it was this transformation that created the culture in which peace-making could flourish … suddenly nationalist, republican and Catholic Ireland had every preconception of the English up-ended and rendered out of date. She didn't have to talk about equality. She exuded it, naturally and with an absence of affectation that was marvellous to behold … she bowled everyone over.\" The thing about Mo was it came to her instinctively. She didn't think about it, it wasn't a strategy, it was passion As a director of documentary films, I've spent a lot of time in Northern Ireland and the republic since Mo died. The island is a second home to me, having been so formative in my teenage years and early 20s. In anticipation of the rewriting of the history books (or at least the omission of certain characters!) I've been pitching a film to commissioners at various broadcasters: an authored, personal story in Mo's memory that would celebrate and explore her legacy for contemporary women. I've been told \"no one would be interested\". That they \"couldn't see who would watch it\". Seemingly a fitting narrative when you look at what played out on the media over the past few days. The only place I have seen Mo remembered as she should be this week was in the middle of a documentary presented by the comedian Patrick Kielty in which he recalled her honesty and straight talking. It made me smile watching the archive of a show he had hosted, with her as a guest. As he said, Mo was \"greeted like a rock star, not a politician\" when she entered the TV studio. A testament to her humanity and ability to connect with all walks of life. ## Revealed: the real Mo Mowlam | Feature Read more Everyone has a story about Mo, and I am constantly amazed by how many people she met in the world. How many people she touched. You can't just erase that memory, however hard they try. She never just \"flew in when the cameras were turned on\" – if anything she snuck out and went to see people when no one was watching. The thing about Mo was that it came to her instinctively. She didn't think about it, it wasn't a strategy, it was instinct, it was passion and it was sheer determination. Mo knew the Good Friday agreement was just the beginning, she knew it was a process and when she died she hoped that whoever took over those reins would honour that, would work at that and would help the people of Northern Ireland to progress to true peace. It wasn't the finished article, and this is where I believe people are going wrong. They are celebrating an end, a solution; but it was a beginning, a starting point. Neil Kinnock at her memorial started his speech about Mo with a very simple statement: \"A light has gone out.\" I often think of those words. A light did go out when Mo left the stage, and while many people will attempt to live in the afterglow of her memory, they cannot remove her from the memories of the people. • Henrietta Norton is a documentary director and writer.

ROTTERDAM, The Netherlands - He may not have come away with the title - he lost a tough three-setter to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the final - but by reaching the final of the ATP World Tour 500 event in Rotterdam, David Goffin is the first Belgian man in tennis history to break the Top 10, rising from No.11 to No.10 today. \"It was a great week in the end,\" Goffin told atpworldtour.com after falling to Tsonga, 4-6 6-4 6-1, in an hour and 55 minutes. \"There was a lot of emotion this week and I won a lot of matches. I was a bit tired. I started the final really well, but in the end Jo played better than me, especially in the third set. \"Of course I'm disappointed, but I played some good tennis and will be in the Top 10 on Monday.\" Goffin has had an impressive last 12 months on the tour, highlighted by his first two Grand Slam quarterfinals at the 2016 French Open (falling to Dominic Thiem) and 2017 Australian Open (falling to Grigor Dimitrov) and back-to-back Masters 1000 semifinals at Indian Wells and Miami last spring. He went as high as No.11 after Roland Garros last year and had spent 24 of the 37 weeks since then at that career-high, just one spot outside the Top 10 - and now he's finally broken that barrier. Check out this hot shot from Goffin's semifinal win over Pierre-Hugues Herbert - the win that propelled Goffin into the Top 10: Watch Goffin hit a hot shot Goffin's the first Belgian man in tennis history to reach the Top 10, but he's not the first Belgian to do it - three women have done it. Here are the three Belgian women who've reached the Top 10: Dominique Monami Monami, who played the last five years of her career under her married name Van Roost, was the first Belgian tennis player, male or female, to reach the Top 10. She made her breakthrough the week of October 12, 1998, following a run to the semifinals of the indoor event in Filderstadt, Germany, where she pulled off back-to-back upsets of Venus Williams and Martina Hingis (falling to Sandrine Testud). Monami's best Grand Slams were two quarterfinals at the Australian Open in 1997 (falling to Mary Joe Fernandez) and 1999 (falling to Amelie Mauresmo), and she went as high as No.9 in the world. Justine Henin & Kim Clijsters Henin and Clijsters are two of the most accomplished players in history, and they actually debuted in the Top 10 the exact same week - the week of June 11, 2001, right after the French Open, where Clijsters edged Henin in the semifinals before losing a marathon to Jennifer Capriati in the final. Both players would win multiple Grand Slam titles (Henin seven, Clijsters four) and reach No.1 (Henin 117 weeks, Clijsters 20 weeks). But while Henin had bigger numbers, Clijsters achieved something no other woman has ever done - she's the only player in WTA history to be ranked No.1 in the world as a mom, sneaking the top spot away from Caroline Wozniacki the week of February 14 to 20, 2011.

To provide a level playing field for all clean athletes at the Olympic Games Rio 2016, the IOC put special measures in place, including targeted pre-tests and the re-analysis of stored samples from the Olympic Games Beijing 2008 and London 2012, following an intelligence-gathering process that started in August 2015. As part of this process, the IOC today announced that 16 athletes have been disqualified from the Olympic Games Beijing 2008. The details follow.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The writer Robert McCrum, in a personal list of \"The 100 greatest novels of all time\" published in \"The Observer\" newspaper, listed the \"Diary\" at number 35.", "reference_documents": ["TITLE: The 100 greatest novels of all time | Books | The Guardian  AUTHOR: https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum  PUBLISHER: https://www.facebook.com/theguardian  PUBLISHED DATETIME: 2003-10-12T10:26:12-0400 Skip to main content The Guardian - Back to home Support The Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Search jobs Sign in current edition: US edition Art & design TV & radio The Observer This article is more than 15 years old # The 100 greatest novels of all time This article is more than 15 years old The British love to read and, as the BBC prepares to reveal the nation's best loved books, The Observer has compiled its own list of essential fiction from the past 300 years. Don't like the list? Feel free to express your dissent on the Observer blog. The list in full Robert McCrum Sun 12 Oct 2003 10.26 EDT First published on Sun 12 Oct 2003 10.26 EDT Britain is a nation of inveterate book readers. Per capita, we borrow, buy, and possibly steal, more books than any country on earth. Literary festivals and book clubs, an extraordinary contemporary phenomenon, flourish here as nowhere else. Like Shakespeare's Don Armado and Holofernes we have 'lived long on the alms-basket of words'; we have eaten folios and drunk ink. In a few days, the BBC's Big Read campaign is going to ignite this papery landscape in a firestorm of bookish discussion. In place of the eternal 'What shall I read next?', a series of nine programmes will answer that not-so-simple question, 'What's my favourite novel?' and broadcast the result of a massive poll into the nation's 'best loved' books. The BBC should be congratulated on this bold initiative, which is bound to excite controversy. It's safe to predict that there will be every possible reaction, from eye-rolling disdain to chin-wagging enthusiasm. Lists - we love them and loathe them. Books - we care passionately about our reading. The books on the bedside table and in the coat pocket shape the inner landscape of our secret lives. Put the two together and you have the fissile materials for some literary fireworks. Here at The Observer, we have no idea what the BBC's list, a closely guarded secret, will look like, though we have heard on the grapevine that it reflects the popular reading preferences of the past 20 years. No doubt Gandalf and Harry Potter will be competing for votes with Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. To add to the debate, and to join the beginnings of a national conversation, we have humbly compiled our own list of One Hundred Books which, we felt, our readers could not do without. Ours is not a list of 'best loved' books. It is less sentimental, and probably less contemporary. It is a catalogue of just a hundred 'essential' titles - as we see it. Of course it is not scientific. Neither Mori nor Gallup was involved. It is partial, prejudiced and highly personal. It reflects whim and fashion. And as we compiled it we began to see actually how difficult - even questionable - the idea of such a unified literary inheritance has become at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Even more agonising are the impossibly hard choices that a list of a hundred forces one to make. First of all, our list is fundamentally English and inevitably reflects the age, sex and education of its Observer contributors. We started with an intra-office email, inviting nominations for a top 10. The matrix of replies produced a surprising unanimity. Top of the list were the universal favourites: Austen and Dickens, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. When a vociferous and influential minority, led by the editor, argued for Beowulf and The Canterbury Tales, we had to introduce a few basic rules. This is a list of prose fiction, not poetry, and not plays. Never mind that Beowulf has the same plot as Jaws, it's a long poem in Old English, by Anon. This rule also eliminated the Iliad and the Odyssey, both of which are, by any standards, books for a desert island. In that category we also included the Authorised Version of the Bible. The play and poetry rule also excluded Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, T.S. Eliot and Auden. With great reluctance we also decided that The Canterbury Tales could not be part of our list. We began at the beginning, with Daniel Defoe and the founding fathers of the English novel. So far, so good. But what about the European tradition? A new set of anxieties hove into view. Ever since Skelton translated Don Quixote, English readers have been dazzled and diverted by the importation of foreign classics. The English Channel exercises its own rough form of literary criticism, and no doubt some important French, Spanish and German titles have been overlooked down the centuries, but we felt we could not exclude, for example, Cervantes, Laclos or Flaubert. Among reluctant omissions were Victor Hugo and Chateaubriand. Once we had passed the Romantics and reached the Victorians, a coherent English list became further complicated by the competing claims of American literature. Just as many nineteenth-century English writers crossed the Atlantic to find audiences and make money in the New World, so American writers became enthusiastically adopted here. Once again, we let the tastes of previous generations of English readers shape the list. Exercising some retrospective affirmative action, we replaced James Fennimore Cooper with Melville and Hawthorne. By the turn of the century, the Anglo-American literary hegemony was firmly established but, to modern tastes, it has become alarmingly dominated by men: James, Crane, Kipling, Wells... You have to look hard to find a woman writer of any consequence, excluding E. Nesbit and Beatrix Potter, between, say, 1880 and 1910. The achievement of Virginia Woolf is all the more remarkable for its assertion of the woman's right to join what had become an exclusive men's club. The mass mobilisation of the Great War finally enfranchised women. It also revolutionised British reading habits. With the arrival of mass culture, which had been in development from late Victorian times, a new strain creeps into the list: the genre novel, from spy thrillers to science fiction. We have tried to select the most distinguished examples of these but are only too painfully aware that some important examples, especially of detective fiction, have been left out. One genre that accounted for several valuable nominations was children's books but, in finding space for Philip Pullman, we had to exclude Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series and C.S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which some will find perverse, even baffling. Julia Donaldson's The Gruffalo , another recent children's book for which The Observer has shown a particular liking, was also excluded for being a picture book for the under fives. We had to draw the line somewhere. Time is a ruthless critic. Books that 50 years ago seemed essential have already dwindled in significance. Virtually nothing survives from 1903. After the Twenties, and after the watershed of Modernism, there are decades when many of the books we considered seemed to be scarcely more than footnotes to the works of Joyce and Woolf. Approaching our own time, if you were to characterise the postwar English literary tradition in a single phrase it would be: The Empire Strikes Back. The proliferation of competing literatures from Australia, India, Canada and South Africa has produced a host of important writers, from David Malouf and Rohinton Mistry to Michael Ondaatje and the recent Nobel laureate J.M. Coetzee. The superabundant vitality of so-called Commonwealth literature has made it correspondingly difficult to arrive at a list that has the earlier clarity and simplicity. Gone are the days when almost all the English writers of consequence lived within a short coach ride of one another. From so many points of view, this has also been a golden age of Anglo-American writing: there has certainly been strong competition from the United States, though The Observer's list has not found space for a number of important figures, from John Steinbeck to Lorrie Moore. At times, a Top Hundred seems cruelly limited. Several women writers were edged out by the intense contemporary competition for space, and also by the inclusion of big names from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Among the men, too, in the battle for space, there were some other notable casualties. How - alas - could we leave out Christopher Isherwood and Jonathan Coe whose What a Carve Up!, a memorably indignant comic assault on Thatcher's Britain, has been one of The Observer's favourite contemporary novels? No doubt there are many more we have wrongly overlooked. This was always a list intended to provoke discussion. There's a further difficulty about selecting contemporary work. The books you read as a teenager, the books you devour in all-night sittings, are the books that enter your imaginative bloodstream like a fierce, exotic drug and stay with you for decades. These are the titles you are likely to nominate for such a list. But The Observer is not written by teenagers. Already it is too late for the books of the 1990s to have that narcotic effect. No doubt in 20 years' time another list will include Don DeLillo's Underworld, Zadie Smith's White Teeth, Annie Proulx's The Shipping News, Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius and Monica Ali's Brick Lane. For the moment, our list largely draws a line at 1989. The year the Wall came down was the end of an era in a double sense. In historical terms it saw the end of the Cold War that had provided the political backdrop to two generations of European writing. In English literary terms, it was the end of a decade that had seen the emergence of an exceptional new generation, from William Boyd and Timothy Mo to Maggie Gee and Vikram Seth. Those, I remember, were stirring times for new fiction. It is tempting to declare 1980, the year of Midnight's Children, as a literary Year Zero. Tempting but wrong. We cannot ignore our inheritance. Who did we miss? So, are you congratulating yourself on having read everything on our list or screwing the newspaper up into a ball and aiming it at the nearest bin? Are you wondering what happened to all those American writers from Bret Easton Ellis to Jeffrey Eugenides, from Jonathan Franzen to Cormac McCarthy? Have women been short-changed? Should we have included Pat Barker, Elizabeth Bowen, A.S. Byatt, Penelope Fitzgerald, Doris Lessing and Iris Murdoch? What's happened to novels in translation such as Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, Hesse's Siddhartha, Mishima's The Sea of Fertility, Süskind's Perfume and Zola's Germinal? Writers such as J.G. Ballard, Julian Barnes, Anthony Burgess, Bruce Chatwin, Robertson Davies, John Fowles, Nick Hornby, Russell Hoban, Somerset Maugham and V.S. Pritchett narrowly missed the final hundred.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Shalimar, made his bid official for the Florida Senate seat held by his father, Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Destin, by filing his paperwork to run in 2016. Matt Gaetz has made no secret of his plans to run for the Senate seat and has already taken aim at Rep. Jimmy Patronis, R-Panama City, who entered the race at the start of December. While Gaetz should prove a formidable candidate, he does have some catching up to do in the fundraising chase. Patronis hauled in more than $90,000 in the first quarter of 2013, while Gaetz brought in around $28,000 during the same period for his 2014 House re-election campaign. Gaetz shows no sign of giving up his House seat and is expected to run for a fourth and final term in 2014. The seat is heavily Republican and Gaetz is not expected to encounter much opposition. He had no opponents in the 2012 general election. Patronis is term-limited in 2014. In the meantime, Gaetz continues to launch attacks on Patronis over social media on a variety of fronts. Gaetz, one of the most prolific members of the Florida Legislature in the use of social media, has been attacking Patronis in recent weeks for supporting the use of state dollars for the Miami Dolphins stadium. Will the Miami Dolphins get a taxpayer funded stadium deal?\" Gaetz asked on Twitter earlier this month. Northwest Floridas JimmyPatronis sure facilitated a floor vote.\" Gaetz then added a hashtag to define his opponent -- #jimmytheliberal. The stakes are high in the Republican primary. The seat that Don Gaetz currently occupies ranks as one of the most Republican Senate districts in Florida. Rick Scott took 55 percent of this Panhandle district in 2010 while Democrat Alex Sink took less than 40 percent. Whoever wins the Republican primary should go on to win the Senate seat. In 2012, Democrats did not field a candidate, leaving Richard Harrison, who was running with no party affiliation, a clear shot at Don Gaetz. The Republican won the race with 74.4 percent of the vote. Tallahassee political writer Jeff Henderson wrote this story exclusively for Sunshine State News.
